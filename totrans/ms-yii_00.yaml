- en: To ensure a consistent development environment and prevent unnecessary alterations
    to your host operation system, it is highly recommended that you run all commands
    within a Linux virtual machine. This will ensure that your output both in your
    web browser and from your command line matches the output that is presented in
    this book. As setting up this environment on your own can be a daunting task,
    prebuilt virtual machines that use VirtualBox and Vagrant are provided to make
    this setup process easy.

- en: To get started with this book, you should be running the latest version of either
    Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10, Apple OS X 10.9 or higher, or a Linux operating
    system that can run virtual machines, such as Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Additionally,
    you will need to install the latest version of VirtualBox (available at [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
    and Vagrant (available at [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)).
