- en: If you are associated with the field of web development, you know how important
    data is. The web runs on data, so it's essential for developers to think of quick
    and effective ways to deal with it. Eloquent is an awesome ORM that comes with
    the Laravel PHP framework. It is unique and is very beneficial to developers as
    it allows them to define models, relationships, and many complex operations with
    a really easy and intuitive syntax, without sacrificing performance. Performing
    an interesting number of operations on multiple tables without writing long queries
    with objects will be a bed of roses.
