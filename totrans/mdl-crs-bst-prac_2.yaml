    get started with site-wide settings and configurations. Now we will take a step
    back and review the basics of pedagogy and instructional design. They are important
    as you set up your educational programs and build courses in Moodle. If you fail
    to take pedagogy and instructional design into consideration early in the process,
    you run the risk of having to rebuild your courses later, which can be very tedious,
    time consuming, and expensive (in terms of labor). So, it's a great idea to bookmark
    this chapter and return to it often, each time you begin to develop a new program,
    course template, demo course, or individual courses.

    structure for your Moodle course and also to selecting the best possible resources,
    activities, and assessments. *You will map all of your resources, activities,
    and assessments to the learning objectives, so the learning objectives (the concrete

    or skills) are what you should keep in mind at every possible moment. *

    learn how to create more specific learning outcomes that will serve as the framework
    that ties the big-picture goals to the resources, activities, and assessments
    of your course. With such a solid foundation and framework, you'll never feel
    lost or frustrated as you build your course. Instead, you'll feel confident as
    you select your course's resources, activities, and assessments.

    you'd like your students to be able to do when they successfully complete it.
    At the same time, it is good to envision how they should demonstrate their new
    knowledge or skill. What your students are able to do as a result of taking the
    course are the learning outcomes of the course. Both terms refer to the notion
    of a course, that is, they focus not just on the content to be covered, but also
    on the skills, abilities, beliefs, and attitudes that result upon completion of
    the course.

    processes and fields in learning. Now, how do we write good learning objectives?
    Because you are focusing on student performance and bearing in mind what you'd

    knowledge, skills, and abilities, your outcomes need to be written with a plan
    of action in mind.

    to structure the course so that each unit ties to a topic. Each topic can directly
    link to a learning objective or a course outcome.

    learning objectives and, then, as we create a structure for the course, each topic
    corresponds to a learning objective. Notice in the screenshot, that there are
    eight topics. If this is an eight-week course, each topic can correspond to one
    week. If it's a 16-week course, each one can correspond to two weeks.

    that need to measure goals and outcomes. The criteria are very handy for making

    results, such as *identify*, *describe*, *analyze*, *evaluate*, and *create*.
    Look back at the guidelines *for writing learning outcomes*, and you'll see that
    some of your original outcomes may not be measurable and may also have other deficiencies.
    Once you recognize that, be sure to change them as soon as you can. This will
    allow you to create a map that ties the learning outcomes to your resources, activities,
