    will also require a "create" privilege and some modification installations might
    need "alter" or "drop" privileges. So the most security-oriented option would

    privilege.

    the installation, all tables in the database to do with phpBB will have this prefix
    in their name, such as **phpbb_users**, and **phpbb_posts**. It’s not compulsory
    to use a prefix, but it’s a nice way to tell your phpBB tables from all the rest,
    in case you have other non-phpBB related tables in the same database. This also
    allows you, for example, to have two or more distinct phpBB installations that
    share the same database; you just need to use a different prefix for each installation.
    Don’t use spaces in this prefix, otherwise the installer will return an error.
    It’s a good idea to leave the default **phpbb_** value for the prefix, if you
    don’t have a reason to change it. Most of the phpBB modifications that you may

    This is also true for any moderators you decide to assign later on. Remind them
    to change their passwords to something really hard to guess. For example using
    the same password as the username is definitely not advisable. Be creative and
    go with something like **y0u11n3v3rgue$$** (read "you’ll never guess") and **wh00p3375**
    (read "whoopee 75"). It’s also a good idea to change this password regularly and

    For instance, from your local machine you can query the database that is running
    on the remote hosting server. This definitely has benefits—for example for making
    local backups of the data in the remote database—but it can be a security risk.
    If the username and password to access the database are somehow revealed, then
    if the remote connection is enabled, an intruder can access your data from his
    or her computer. If the remote connection is disabled, the hacker will have to
    have access to the remote server in order to be able to connect to your database.
    Additionally with remote connection enabled, the potential hacker can try to guess
    what your password is by trying different combinations until he or she is connected.

    pre-installation section) so that it’s writable by all, and you install phpBB,
    it’s time to revert back. Using the exact same methodology as described before,
    change the permissions to 664.

- en: A little extra layer of protection for the admin panel can be the setting of
    an `.htaccess` directory protection. `.htaccess` is a file that can contain a
    number of instructions for the Apache web server that are applicable for the directory
    where the `.htaccess` file is and to all sub-directories. Setting up `.htaccess`
    protection will result in an additional username/password window that will be
    displayed when you enter the admin panel. Setting up the protection may not be
    a trivial task, and there are quite a few tutorials available on the Web that
    can help you with this. `.htaccess` documentation can be found on the Apache website
    at [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/htaccess.html](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/htaccess.html).

    (a control panel) that can help you setting up the protection.

- en: So using `.htaccess` directly or through a friendlier interface you can protect
    the `admin` sub-directory within the root phpBB directory using a username and
    password different than the "normal" administration password. This way you’re
    making it harder for potential intruders as they have two different username/password
    pair to deal with.

    the people that can help you out if you have a problem that you cannot figure
    out. On phpBB.com, there is a support section that contains "static" articles
    such as the user guide, the knowledge base, and the FAQ, and there’s also the
    community section (that is not surprisingly powered by phpBB) where phpBB users
    from around the globe share their experience. The same sort of community of users
    you can find on phpBBHacks.com.

    someone has had and resolved the exact same problem, and this individual is most
    likely to share the resolution. So it’s very probable that the question you have
    has already been asked and answered. All you need to do is find it. If you can’t
    find the resolution you need, post your question on the bulletin board, but make
    sure you search first.
