- en: Collaboration can be a cornerstone of social constructivism and a place where
    students truly learn from each other. They can share their insights, set goals
    and targets, and bring prior learning to their collaborations. In addition, collaborations
    allow students to develop a body of knowledge or a project plan that can be implemented
    in the real world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One strategy for collaboration is to engage students in activities that require
    each person to contribute to the final product. Two popular activities are informative
    wikis and topic-based glossaries. While wiki and glossary activities can be completed
    individually, they are perfect vehicles for collaboration. The key is to examine
    the learning objectives and determine how best to implement them. In this chapter,
    we'll discuss various strategies for getting your students engaged in collaborations
    and excited about learning from each other.

- en: This chapter teaches you how to develop effective collaborative activities that
    allow you to achieve your learning objectives by adding wikis and glossaries to
    your course. It is a way to build up social constructivism and implement the theories
    first developed by psychologist Lev Vygotsky, who discussed how people first learn
    in a group context and then, later, on an individual level. While such learning
    happens in any interaction (such as a forum, a workshop, and more), in wikis and
    glossaries, the focus is on a collaborative end product, so the interactions can
    be even more focused. These activities enable students to work together and build
    up a body of knowledge. The resulting collection of knowledge (the completed wikis
    and glossaries) can be reused by students in future courses. As the course evolves,
    the wikis and glossaries that past students created can be retained, edited, referenced,
    and grown.

- en: In our distributed world, where people move from place to place and still communicate
    with each other and develop work products together, it is necessary to understand
    how to collaborate productively in a virtual environment. Therefore, there is
    a pragmatic side to the emphasis on collaboration. Moodle's wiki and glossary
    activities replicate how people use cloud-based collaboration in the workplace
    to generate reports, guides, marketing materials, and more.

    synchronous web conferencing. This also replicates today's workplace, making the
    Moodle classroom even more effective for training people not only in the subject
    matter but also in new ways of working and learning.

- en: We use Moodle precisely for its flexible architecture – a structure that encourages
    learning from each other. The ability to contribute to glossaries, wikis, and
    other collaborative activities allows students to contribute knowledge in a way
    that reinforces and rewards. Thus, it is an instructional strategy that brings
    together motivation, self-confidence, and curiosity, which creates conditions
    for learning. Additionally, it is a way to reinforce prior knowledge and build
    up experience as students recall past learning, add to what they already know,
    and reflect on what others are contributing. It's also a strategy for overcoming
    the negative effects of isolation and distance and for rehumanizing the experience
    of working in isolation, which can be disconcertingly difficult.

    On the surface, a glossary is a list of words and definitions that students can
    access. However, a course creator allows students to add entries to the glossary.
    Adding entries transforms the glossary from a static list of vocabulary words
    into a collaborative tool for learning purposes. It also has an auto-linking feature
    that means that any time the word is used in the course, it automatically links
    to the glossary entry:'

    and describe items or phenomena, the **Glossary** activity is ideal. For example,
    you might have a course on tourism and wish to develop a glossary of terms that
    are specialized in a specific area; for example, the terms regarding *culture
    tourism*. Students can collaborate and make a customized glossary that can help
    them during the course and, later, in their careers.

    in your course. When this is turned on by a site administrator and a word from
    the **Glossary** activity appears in the course, it's highlighted. Clicking on
    the word brings up a pop-up window with the word's entry in the glossary. The
    entry can consist of text, images, media, and links. It is a miniature page devoted
    to defining and elucidating the glossary term. The auto-linking feature makes
    collaborative possibilities even richer. For example, students might be assigned
    specific glossary terms that they will use as the basis of an illustrative paragraph
    or passage.

    you can choose to make a glossary global. In this case, the words from this glossary
    will be highlighted and clickable wherever they are on your site. The work done
    in one course will then become available to all the courses on your site. If your
    site's subject matter is highly focused, consider using a global glossary. If
    your site's subject matter is very broad, such as in a university-wide learning
    site, you should use local glossaries to avoid confusion. For example, imagine
    that you have a course in chemistry and another in statistics. Both use the word
    *granular*, but chemistry uses the term to indicate a powdered substance, while
    statistics uses it to indicate a fine level of detail.

    **Main** or **Secondary**. The **Main glossary** setting refers to a glossary
    that will include terms from other glossaries. The **Secondary glossary** setting
    refers to a glossary that stands alone; it does not include terms from any other
    glossaries. For example, you might have an overall glossary for science terms
    and standalone glossaries such as physics, chemistry, biology, and geology as
    secondary glossaries. This is an important distinction when creating collaborative
    activities if you want the students to be able to add new terms. However, if you
    want to keep the glossary terms limited to the ones that align with your learning
    objectives, it's best to avoid secondary glossaries.

    group knowledge. The key difference between a forum and a wiki is that when users
    enter a forum, they see a thread devoted to a topic. Each entry is short. Users
    read through the thread, one entry at a time. The result is that the discussion
    becomes prominent. In a wiki, users see the end result of the writing. To see
    the history of the writing, they must select a **History** tab. The result is

- en: Moodle offers several options for students to collaborate on building a body
    of knowledge. For instance, a class can work together to build a glossary that
    can be imported and reused in future classes. They can work together to write
    a wiki, which provides an opportunity for them to organize their knowledge into
    a narrative. Moodle 4.0 is designed for maximum flexibility, and it puts social
    interaction at the heart of its core philosophy. That means that collaborative
    wikis and glossaries are perfect activities in Moodle 4.0, and they can be used
    in conjunction with 100% online activities alongside those that incorporate in-person,
    face-to-face interactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both glossaries and wikis are very effective for a combination of synchronous
    and asynchronous learning. For example, group members can chat with each other
    as they develop their definitions (glossaries) or collaborative projects (wikis).
    Additionally, they can schedule synchronous web conferences by integrating and
    embedding BigBlueButton or linking to an outside platform such as Zoom, Google
    Meet, or Microsoft Teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such engagement is highly motivating, and students will be more likely to stay
    involved with the course and also learn from each other. Incorporating collaborative
    glossaries and wikis can also help students feel more confident about learning
    and take their knowledge easily from coursework to real-world applications.
