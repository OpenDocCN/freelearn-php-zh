- en: You already know you want to learn PHP 7, and a smarter way to learn PHP development
    is to learn by doing. *The PHP Workshop* focuses on building up your practical
    skills so that you can develop cutting-edge, high-performance web applications.
    It's ideal if you're looking to work with an existing application, or even develop
    your own side project with a PHP framework like Laravel. You'll learn from real
    examples that lead to real results.

- en: Throughout *The PHP Workshop*, you'll take an engaging step-by-step approach
    to understanding PHP development. You won't have to sit through any unnecessary
    theory. If you're short on time you can jump into a single exercise each day or
    spend an entire weekend learning about third-party libraries. It's your choice.
    Learning on your terms, you'll build up and reinforce key skills in a way that
    feels rewarding.
