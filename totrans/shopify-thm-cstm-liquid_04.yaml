- en: This section will dive into the Liquid core, which consists of three main features
    – objects, tags, and filters – which will help us set a solid groundwork for our
    future learning. We will learn how to use the different types of objects at our
    disposal, combined with Liquid programming logic, to turn static templates into
    a fully dynamic store. Lastly, through the power of filters, we will learn how
    to manipulate various types of data and turn even a simple set of data into complex
    features.
