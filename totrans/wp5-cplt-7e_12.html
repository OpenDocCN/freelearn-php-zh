            <article>
                
<p>Social media has grown a lot in importance over the last few years. Basically, if you don't have your profile on at least a couple of the most popular social networks, then you might as well not exist at all, right? Well, no matter if you agree with this or not, it certainly rings true for your website. In other words, if you hope to attract any kind of audience and somehow convince them to keep coming back to your website, you absolutely have to (<em>have to!</em>) integrate it with social media.</p>
<p>Luckily, WordPress lets you do this in a more or less easy-to-grasp way. Even though social media integration is not a built-in feature per se, it can still be enabled via different plugins or other mechanisms. In this chapter, you will learn all about these features. We'll cover things such as how to enable simple social media share buttons on your website, how to work with social media APIs and integrations, and how to publish your blog content to social media automatically.</p>
<p>But wait, that's not all! We're also going to cover podcasting (which, for some website owners is an important element of their online presence), and a relatively new topic in the WordPress realm<span>—</span><strong>HTTPS</strong> (<strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</strong>), which is all about making your website more secure by adding an additional level of encryption to the browser-website communication. An important thing worth pointing out here is that Google now expects all websites to have HTTPS encryption enabled. If your website fails to comply, Google might decide to lower your search engine rankings, and thus make your website less visible compared to your competition.</p>
<p>In short, the topics we will explore in this chapter include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="h1">Integrating social media</li>
<li class="h1">Podcasting</li>
<li class="h1">HTTPS—what, why, and how?</li>
</ul>

<p>We've briefly mentioned the topic of social media integration in <a href="1f05677b-dcae-4511-9add-b4cf68718507.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Plugins – What They Are and Why You Need Them,</em> when discussing the plugins that are worth having on your WordPress site. So now, let's take a moment to expand on this and list some more ways in which you can make your website social-media friendly, as well as understand why you'd want to do this in the first place.</p>
<p>Let's start with the <em>why</em>. In this day and age, social media is one of the main drivers of traffic for many websites. Even if you just want to share your content with friends and family, or you have some serious business plans regarding your website, you need to have at least some level of social media integration.</p>
<p>Even if you only install simple social media share buttons, you are effectively encouraging your visitors to pass your content onto their followers, thus expanding your reach and making your content more popular.</p>

<p>There are a handful of ways to make your website social media friendly. The most common approaches are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up social media share buttons, which allows your visitors to share your content with their friends and followers</li>
<li>Setting up social media APIs integration, which make your content look better on social media (design-wise)</li>
<li>Setting up automatic content distribution to social media</li>
<li>Setting up social media metrics tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's discuss these one by one.</p>

<p>This is something we talked about in <a href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/wordpress_complete___7th_edition/wp-admin/post.php?post=33&amp;action=edit#post_28" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Plugins - What They Are and Why You Need Them</em>, when discussing plugins. There are hundreds of social media plugins available out there that allow you to display a basic set of social media buttons on your website. The one we advise you to use is called <strong>Simple Social Media Share Buttons</strong> (this plugin is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/</a>). Its main advantage is that it allows you to display buttons for all of the most popular social media networks, and you can also choose where and how you want these buttons displayed.</p>
<p>You can find a full description, plus a tutorial on how to set everything up, in <a href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/wordpress_complete___7th_edition/wp-admin/post.php?post=33&amp;action=edit#post_28" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Plugins – What They Are and Why You Need Them</em>.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up social media APIs integration</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The next step worth taking to make your content appear more attractive on social media is to integrate it with a number of social media APIs; particularly, that of Twitter. What exactly Twitter's API is and how it works isn't very relevant to the WordPress discussion that we're having here. So instead, let's just focus on what the outcome of integrating your website with this API is.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows what a standard tweet mentioning a website usually looks like (pay attention to the overall design, not the text content itself):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7c05ecdd-09b0-441d-840c-dbfb56360864.png" style="width:41.25em;height:24.42em;" width="1222" height="725"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here's a different tweet, mentioning an article from a website that has Twitter's (Twitter Cards) API enabled:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/333a8bf3-3862-482d-b5c0-9cd4a3cd1c1c.png" style="width:31.92em;height:34.92em;" width="1178" height="1288"/></p>
<p>This looks much better. Luckily, having this level of Twitter integration is quite easy. All you need is a plugin called <span class="packt_screen">JM Twitter Cards</span> (this is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jm-twitter-cards/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/jm-twitter-cards/</a>). After installing and activating it, you will be guided through the process of setting everything up and approving your website with Twitter (which is a mandatory step).</p>

<p>The idea behind the automatic social media distribution of your content is that you don't have to remember to do so manually whenever you publish a new post. Instead of copying and pasting the URL address of your new post by hand to each individual social media platform, you can have this done automatically.</p>
<p>This can be done in numerous ways, but let's discuss the two most usable ones: the <em>Jetpack</em> and <em>Revive Old Posts</em> plugins.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The Jetpack plugin</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Jetpack</span> plugin is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/</a>. We talked about the Jetpack plugin and its many modules in <a href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/wordpress_complete___7th_edition/wp-admin/post.php?post=33&amp;action=edit#post_28" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Plugins – What They Are and Why You Need Them</em>. One of these modules can be found by navigating to the <span class="packt_screen">Jetpack</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> section of <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, and then to the <span class="packt_screen">Sharing</span> tab:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ae1ada3e-e0f5-47dc-a9b8-b7c6ce7ca31a.png" style="width:37.58em;height:17.75em;" width="1210" height="572"/></p>
<p>Here, you will be able to enable the feature labeled <span class="packt_screen">Automatically share your posts to social networks</span> (this is visible in the preceding screenshot).</p>
<p>After doing so, click on the new link that will appear, labeled <span class="packt_screen">Connect your social media accounts</span>. This will allow you to integrate with the available social media platforms, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c3ea716c-c016-42ca-ada7-0cf6caed5b26.png" style="width:30.17em;height:29.00em;" width="620" height="595"/></p>
<p>After going through the process of authorizing the plugin with each service, your website will be fully capable of posting each of your new posts to social media automatically.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Revive Old Posts plugin</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Revive Old Posts</span> plugin is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tweet-old-post/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/tweet-old-post/</a>. While the <span class="packt_screen">Jetpack</span> plugin takes the newest posts on your website and distributes them to your various social media accounts, the <span class="packt_screen">Revive Old Posts</span> plugin does the same with your archived posts, ultimately giving them a new life—hence the name, <span class="packt_screen">Revive Old Posts</span>.</p>
<p>After downloading and activating this plugin, go to the <span><span class="packt_screen">Revive Old Posts</span> </span>section in <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. Then, switch to the <span class="packt_screen">Accounts</span> tab. Here, you can enable the plugin by adding your social media accounts and authorizing them. The plugin will take you through the steps required to enable everything properly. These individual steps depend on the social media platform that you want to enable and change frequently over time, but you can always count on <span class="packt_screen">Revive Old Posts</span> to be in tune with the most recent requirements:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/fd9b6a52-f3b7-4bd0-b58a-884f6ca50112.png" style="width:49.00em;height:26.92em;" width="1627" height="894"/></p>
<p>Next, go to the <span class="packt_screen">General Settings</span> tab and handle the time intervals and other details of how you want the plugin to work with your social media accounts, as demonstrated in the following screenshot. When you're done, just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5bbdd194-cc84-4eec-b4e9-a9f0158bbe16.png" width="1950" height="1327"/></p>
<p>At this point, the plugin will start operating automatically and distribute random archived posts to your social media accounts.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Note that it's probably a good idea to not share things too often if you don't want to anger your followers and make them unfollow you. For that reason, I would advise against posting more than once a day.</div>

<p>The final element of our social media integration puzzle is to set up some kind of tracking mechanism that will tell us how popular our content is on social media (in terms of shares).</p>
<p>Granted, you can do this manually by going to each of your posts and checking their share numbers individually. However, there's a quicker method, and it involves another plugin. This one is called <span class="packt_screen">Social Metrics Tracker</span>, and you can download it at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-metrics-tracker/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-metrics-tracker/</a>.</p>
<p>In short, this plugin collects social shares data from a number of platforms and displays it to you in a single readable dashboard view. After you install and activate the plugin, you'll need to give it a couple of minutes to crawl through your social media accounts and get the data. Soon after that, you will be able to visit the plugin's dashboard by going to the <span class="packt_screen">Social Metrics</span> section in <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/167e5391-2331-4976-b5ff-14bfd1fdfdfa.png" width="868" height="424"/></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For some web hosts and setups, this plugin might end up consuming too much of the server's resources. If this happens, consider activating it only occasionally to check your results and then deactivate it again. Doing this even once a week will still give you a great overview of how well your content is performing on social media.</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>This ends our short guide on how to integrate your WordPress site with social media. I'll admit that we're just scratching the surface here, and there's a lot more that can be done. There are new social media plugins being released almost every week, and describing every single one of them would fill a book of its own. That being said, the methods described here are more than enough to make your WordPress site social media friendly and enable you to share your content effectively with your friends, family, and audience.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Podcasting</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Podcasting has become very popular in the last couple of years. Right now, there are thousands of podcasts available on the web, touching upon any topic or niche imaginable. Basically, a podcast is like a radio show or program, but run on entirely the internet. Under the hood, however, a podcast is just an audio recording. It can be episodic or serial, depending on your preference and the way you want to make it. The main idea with podcasts is that people can subscribe to them and they are notified whenever a new episode becomes available. Basically, your subscribers, instead of reading your posts on their computers, can listen to your content through their headphones at any time.</p>
<p>Adding a podcast to your WordPress blog is quite easy. From a technical point of view, the <em>subscription</em> mechanism of a podcast is handled by <strong>Really Simple Syndication</strong> (<strong>RSS</strong>) feeds. RSS is a web technology that allows you to deliver (or consume) content structured in an XML format. RSS feeds are usually organized with the most recent information at the top. The way WordPress works with RSS feeds by default, is that it enables feeds for your most recent posts, as well as for the most recent comments. Whoever wants to stay up to date with your content can use one of the popular feed aggregators and connect to your website's RSS feed. For example, <strong>Feedly</strong> (<a href="https://feedly.com">https://feedly.com</a>) is a popular solution.</p>
<p>Using an RSS feed is also how podcast distribution is handled in WordPress. While generating your blog's RSS feeds, WordPress automatically adds all the required tags if an audio file is linked within that post. These tags are read by podcast clients/tools (such as iTunes). Therefore, all you need to do is create a post, and WordPress will handle the rest for you.</p>

<li>Recording yourself</li>
<li>Making a post</li>

<p>By using any commercial or free software, you can record your voice, a conversation, music, or anything else you'd like to podcast, and then save it as an MP3 file. You may also find that you need to do some editing afterward.</p>
<p>Some examples of good software to consider using are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recommend using <strong>Audacity</strong>, which is a free, cross-platform sound recorder and editor. You can download Audacity from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/</a>. You may have to do a bit of extra fiddling around to get the MP3 part working, so pay attention to the additional instructions at that point. If you don't want to learn the basics of audio compression and equalization, you may also want to use a leveling tool, such as the <strong>Levelator</strong>, which can be found at <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator/">http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator/</a>. Although it has not been updated since the end of 2012, it still works well if you want to level the volume in a simple audio file.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use <strong>OBS Studio</strong>, which can be found at <a href="https://obsproject.com/download">https://obsproject.com/download</a>. It's another cross-platform solution, it's open source, and some users find it superior to other tools in the market.</li>
<li>If you are working on macOS and want some free software, take a look at <em>Garage Band</em>. It comes with the OS, so it will already be installed on your computer.</li>
<li>If you want to examine some advanced pieces of audio software, called <strong>Digital Audio Workstations</strong> (<strong>DAWs</strong>), and are used by professional podcast producers and musicians, then look into <strong>Sonar X2</strong>, <strong>Studio One</strong>, <strong>Logic</strong>, or <strong>ProTools</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you've created an MP3 file and it's sitting on your computer, you're ready to create a WordPress post that will be the home for the first episode of your podcast. Take a look at the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, go to <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> like you normally would. Enter some initial text into your post if you want to provide a description for the episode. Also, at this point, add a new category called <em><span class="packt_screen">Podcast</span></em> to your blog.</li>
<li>Just so you can learn the basics of including media files, let's upload your media file to your WordPress media library. Later on in this chapter, I will explain why this is not always the most effective approach. However, for now, we're here to learn. Start by adding a new block to the page, called <span class="packt_screen">Audio</span>. Next, pick an audio file from your desktop and upload it, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1c84be0e-de7e-434a-819d-535203295f87.png" style="width:27.67em;height:33.08em;" width="615" height="737"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When the upload finishes, you'll see your audio file right in the post itself (remember that audio files are bigger than images, so uploading will always take a little longer), as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cd985473-a470-479d-8cf2-ae71583d997b.png" style="width:35.00em;height:9.42em;" width="947" height="255"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make any other changes or additions you want, and publish the post.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Your website's RSS feed can now be used by podcast clients to pick up your podcast. You can use your own podcast client to subscribe right away. If you are using iTunes, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Advanced</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Subscribe to podcast</span><span class="packt_screen">, </span>and paste the RSS feed URL of the new podcast category you've just set (for example, <kbd>http://yoursite.com/category/podcast/feed/</kbd>). At this point, you (and your visitors) can enjoy the new podcast that you've just created.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">This is just how <em>you</em> can add your podcast to <em>your own</em> iTunes. If you want to make the podcast searchable via iTunes for the public, you need to go through the submission process, as described at <a href="https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/podcasts/overview">https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/podcasts/overview</a>.</div>

<p>You have just learned that it's quite easy to add a podcast to your WordPress website. However, if you want additional features, you may want to use a podcasting plugin. Some additional features could be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic feed generation and configurable RSS feeds to optimize your podcast even further for clients, such as iTunes, Google Play, or Stitcher</li>
<li>A preview of what your podcast will look like in iTunes</li>
<li>Downloading statistics and tracking the number of listeners you're getting</li>
<li>New custom post types to handle your podcasts in a more specialized way</li>
<li>Running multiple podcasts from the same website</li>
<li>Shortcodes for displaying your podcast episode lists, single episodes, and playlists</li>
<li>Easy settings to host your episodes on another server</li>
</ul>
<p>There are quite a number of podcast-related plugins available in the WordPress plugin repository. The three most popular ones are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PowerPress Podcasting plugin by Blubrry</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Seriously Simple Podcasting</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Podlove Podcast Publisher</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/podlove-podcasting-plugin-for-wordpress/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/podlove-podcasting-plugin-for-wordpress/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">For an in-depth guide on how to use the PowerPress plugin (which is my favorite one from the preceding list) and how to configure it correctly, watch this 30-minute video tutorial by Pat Flynn at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei67QMWD4MA#!">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei67QMWD4MA#!</a>. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to optimize your podcast and set it up properly, so that it can be picked up by iTunes and then shared with the community.</div>
<p>There are hundreds of other similar plugins available. You can find them by looking at all the plugins tagged <kbd>podcasting</kbd> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/podcasting">https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/podcasting</a>) in the official plugin directory at WordPress.org. Don't forget to read the plugin descriptions and user reviews to decide which of these might be the best match for you.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the old-school approach of uploading your podcast straight to your blog has its flaws, which doesn't make it the most effective way to handle things these days. First of all, if you want to host the media file on your main server (the one where your website is hosted), you can quickly encounter serious bandwidth problems, especially if your podcast becomes popular. Also, there's a problem with the maximum upload size in WordPress. Depending on your web host, you might not be able to upload files larger than 2 MB, 8 MB, or 16 MB (you can contact your web host's support to clarify this for you). This is what the problem looks like in the uploader:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5e5db9c8-eff8-4aa0-a940-db9700a11859.png" style="width:31.92em;height:6.75em;" width="421" height="89"/></p>
<p>Therefore, if you anticipate having a large number of subscribers, or if you plan to produce such a large volume that you'll run out of space on your server, you can use an external hosting service that will host your audio files, either for a fee or free of cost. Some options to consider are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Libsyn</strong>: This company provides effective and affordable podcast hosting. Go to <a href="https://www.libsyn.com/">https://www.libsyn.com/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Blubrry</strong>: This is another great host for podcasts. What makes their offer particularly interesting is that they integrate with WordPress very well. They even have their own plugin, which I mentioned earlier in this chapter. Go to <a href="https://create.blubrry.com/resources/podcast-media-hosting/">https://create.blubrry.com/resources/podcast-media-hosting/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>PodBean</strong>: This company offers free podcast hosting for a period of time. Go to <a href="https://podbean.com/">https://podbean.com/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with each of the companies mentioned is slightly different. However, the main thing that you always need to do is to upload your media file to your chosen company's servers, rather than to your own media library in WordPress. In return, you'll get a direct URL pointing to your podcast file, which you can then use however you wish. For instance, you can insert the URL into your WordPress post using one of the plugins mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the story of HTTPS starts somewhere else—it starts with <strong>HTTP</strong> (<strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>). HTTP is a web protocol, through which information is sent online between the user's web browser and the website they're trying to visit. HTTP defines the structure of this data and the way it's being sent. This topic is highly technical, and we certainly don't need to understand it from top to bottom just for the purpose of what we're discussing in this chapter.</p>
<p>Overall, the current way in which HTTP is implemented doesn't allow for very secure connections. For the most part, with HTTP, data is transmitted in plain text, which means that if someone were to intercept the communication, they would be able to see everything that's being transmitted. Now, this may not seem like much of a problem at first, but imagine what could happen when dealing with sensitive information. For example, when you're submitting your credit card information at an online checkout, you really don't want it to be intercepted by anyone. Unfortunately, HTTP doesn't give you any sort of protection in that area. This is where HTTPS comes into play.</p>

<p><strong>HTTPS</strong>, which stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure<span> </span></strong>, is basically an upgraded version of HTTP. Under the hood, the main mechanisms that make it work are kind of the same; but instead of using its own layer protocol for sending data, HTTPS uses additional protocols, secure ones, called a <strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (<strong>SSL</strong>), and <strong>Transport Layer Security</strong> (<strong>TLS</strong>). SSL encrypts the information that's being sent, which means that even if someone intercepts it, they won't be able to decode it anyway. The true meaning of the data is not visible without the encryption/decryption key.</p>
<p>So, how do you know if a website has HTTPS? Finding this out is very simple. Basically, your web browser will let you know. When you're visiting a website that has HTTPS enabled (and properly integrated), you'll see a green padlock icon next to the website's address. Additionally, you should also see <kbd>https://</kbd> in the address bar. The following screenshot shows an example of this from PayPal:</p>

<p>While HTTPS is not a requirement per se, it's still a great step towards a safer web overall. Every website that supports HTTPS is simply safer to use, especially when dealing with any sort of user input. Quite naturally, people are not happy about submitting their personal information anywhere, particularly if they're not sure whether this information is going to be taken care of properly. These days, we're constantly hearing about hacks and security breaches, even at some of the most respectable web properties. With that in the picture, the public becomes more concerned with data security and privacy every year.</p>
<p>That said, modern WordPress sites need to embrace the idea to the fullest. There really is no downside to having HTTPS enabled on your website, and the process of doing it is not too difficult either. Added to this, in 2014, Google announced that HTTPS was officially a ranking factor for Google search. What this means is that you have a better chance of getting your website ranked, and thus found by potential visitors, if you have HTTPS integrated.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to set up HTTPS</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Setting up HTTPS on WordPress is a two-part process, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you need to have an SSL certificate assigned to you, which you can then use on the website</li>
<li>Second, you need to integrate this SSL with your WordPress site</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start with getting the SSL certificate itself. The thing with this is that they often come with a price tag. A good certificate can cost you anywhere from a couple of dollars to as much as $600 per year. This probably doesn't sound too attractive, but luckily for everyone, there are also good, free SSL options out there. Particularly, one called <strong>Let's Encrypt</strong> (<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">https://letsencrypt.org/</a>). Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open <strong>Certificate Authority</strong> (<strong>CA</strong>). It has been found to popularize SSLs and make them affordable for all websites, thus increasing the number of websites worldwide with encrypted connections.</p>
<p>The way you can get started with Let's Encrypt depends on the web host of where your WordPress website is hosted. Usually, at least with most hosts, you can enable a Let's Encrypt certificate straight from your hosting control panel. Showing the exact steps of how that's done would be difficult to do, since each host has their own control panel and their own way of letting you enable a Let's Encrypt certificate. Therefore, the first step is to actually contact your host and ask them to help you enable the certificate.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Before you do that, you can consult the official documentation at Let's Encrypt and make sure that your host does indeed support Let's Encrypt certificates. This documentation can be found at <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920">https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920</a>.</p>
<p>After you go through your host's process, which shouldn't be too complicated, you can finish up the integration in your WordPress dashboard. In order to make your website fully integrated, you're going to need an additional plugin. This plugin is called <span class="packt_screen">Really Simple SSL</span> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/</a>) and it's going to do two main things for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will update the URL of your website to HTTPS and overwrite the previous settings in the WordPress database</li>
<li>It will add a permanent 301 redirect to your non-HTTPS URLs so that all your visitors, as well as search engines, will be forwarded to the new HTTPS versions of your content (such as posts and pages)</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin is very simple to use. All you need to do is install and activate it, and then you can go into the plugin's settings in <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">SSL</span>. Once there, just click on the main <span class="packt_screen">Go ahead, activate SSL!</span> button, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/361753e5-a902-4d16-8af0-fbde7775535e.png" width="1010" height="221"/></p>
<p>The plugin will then work its magic in the background, and once it's done, it will log you out of the admin panel. This is normal, so you don't need to be worried here. When you try logging back in, you'll notice that you've been redirected to the HTTPS version of the admin panel. Just to make sure that everything is working, you can try visiting your website at <kbd>http://YOURSITE.com</kbd>, and see if you get automatically redirected to <kbd>https://YOURSITE.com</kbd>. At this stage, your WordPress site is fully integrated with HTTPS!</p>

<p>There was a lot going on in this chapter. First, we focused on social media integration—the bread and butter of all modern websites. Next, there was the topic of podcasting and a brief guide to getting started (how to configure your feeds, what plugins to use, and so on). Finally, we talked about HTTPS and SSL certificates<span>—</span>what they are, their importance for your website's security (and the security of your visitors' personal information), and how to enable them.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll discuss the topic of developing your own plugins and widgets, including what the basics are and how to get your head around them. We'll also introduce you to the REST full API.</p>
