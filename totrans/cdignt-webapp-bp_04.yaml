    share roughly the same structure: the user uploads an image and that image can
    be shared, allowing others to view that image. Perhaps limits or constraints are
    placed on the viewing of an image, perhaps the image only remains viewable for
    a set period of time, or within set dates, but the general structure is the same.
    And I''m happy to announce that this project is exactly the same.'

  zh: 目前有很多图像共享网站。它们都具有大致相同的结构：用户上传图像，该图像可以被共享，允许其他人查看该图像。可能对图像的查看设置了限制或约束，可能图像仅在特定时间段内或特定日期内可见，但总体结构是相同的。我很高兴地宣布，这个项目与此完全相同。

    will be assigned to that image. The image can be accessed via that URL.'

- en: The idea of using a unique URL to access that image is so that we can control

    they are directed to `do_upload`.'

  zh: '**创建**：想象一下这是一个起点。用户将看到一个简单的表单，允许他们上传图像。一旦用户按下上传按钮，他们就会被引导到`do_upload`。'
- en: '**do_upload**: The uploaded image is validated for size and file type. If it
    passes, then a unique eight-character string is generated. This string is then
    used as the name of a folder we will make. This folder is present in the main
    `upload` folder and the uploaded image is saved in it. The image details (image
    name, folder name, and so on) are then passed to the database model, where another
    unique code is generated for the image URL. This unique code, image name, and
    folder name are then saved to the database.'
  id: totrans-22
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The user is then presented with a message informing them that their image has
    been uploaded and that a URL has been created. The user is also presented with
    the image they have uploaded.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**go**: This will take a URL provided by someone typing into a browser''s address
    bar, or an `img src` tag, or some other method. The `go` item will look at the
    unique code in the URL, query the database to see if that code exists, and if
    so, fetch the folder name and image name and deliver the image back to the method
    that called it.'

    of accepting a variety of images and assigning them to records in a database and
    unique folders in the filesystem. This is interesting as it leaves things open
    to you to improve on. For example, you can do the following:    *   You can add
    limits on views. As the image record is stored in the database, you could adapt
    the database. Adding two columns called `img_count` and `img_count_limit`, you
    could allow a user to set a limit for the number of views per image and stop providing
    that image when that limit is met. *   You can limit views by date. Similar to
    the preceding point, but you could limit image views to set dates. *   You can
    have different URLs for different dimensions. You could add functionality to make
    several dimensions of image based on the initial upload, offering several different
    URLs for different image dimensions. *   You can report abuse. You could add an
    option allowing viewers of images to report unsavory images that might be uploaded.
    *   You can have terms of service. If you are planning on offering this type of
    application as an actual web service that members of the public could use, then
    I strongly recommend you add a terms of service document, perhaps even require
    that people agree to terms before they upload an image.          In those terms,
    you''ll want to mention that in order for someone to use the service, they first
    have to agree that they do not upload and share any images that could be considered
    illegal. You should also mention that you''ll cooperate with any court if information
    is requested of you.                    You really don''t want to get into trouble
    for owning or running a web service that stores unpleasant images; as much as
    possible you want to make your limits of liability clear and emphasize that it
    is the uploader who has provided the images.              In the next chapter,
    we will create a newsletter signup system. You''ll be able to get people to sign
    up and have their details in a database. People will be allowed to unsubscribe

    *   你可以根据日期限制查看次数。类似于前面的点，但你可以将图像查看次数限制在特定日期。 *   你可以为不同尺寸提供不同的URL。你可以添加功能，根据初始上传创建多个尺寸的图像，为不同的图像尺寸提供多个不同的URL。
    *   你可以报告滥用。你可以添加一个选项，允许图像查看者报告可能被上传的不当图像。 *   你可以设置服务条款。如果你计划提供此类应用程序作为公众可以使用的实际网络服务，那么我强烈建议你添加一份服务条款文档，甚至可能要求人们在上传图像之前同意条款。在那些条款中，你将想要提到，为了使用该服务，人们首先必须同意他们不会上传和分享任何可能被视为非法的图像。你还应提到，如果需要，你将配合任何法院。你真的不希望因为拥有或运营一个存储令人不快的图像的网络服务而陷入麻烦；尽可能明确地说明你的责任限制，并强调是上传者提供了图像。在下一章中，我们将创建一个新闻通讯注册系统。你将能够让人们注册，并将他们的详细信息存储在数据库中。人们将被允许取消订阅和选择不同的设置。```'
