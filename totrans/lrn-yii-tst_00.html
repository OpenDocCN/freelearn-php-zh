<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Since I've stumbled upon Yii first and Codeception later on, I couldn't believe that someone actually thought of solving the eternal damnation of a difficult testing panorama that most web developers, including me, have suffered with for so many years.</p><p>I've poured a good part of myself into this book, hoping that I could finally create a book that I never managed to find when I needed to learn about testing.</p><p>I believe the hardest part has been concentrating all of the accumulated experience, reading, conferences, and chats I've had about quality assurance, testing, and project management.</p><p>But this wouldn't have been possible without the great effort that has been put into Yii in its current version (version 2) and Codeception. Both these pieces of software, and the rest that are noted throughout the book, are the result of the efforts of hundreds of developers across the globe.</p><p>With all of this, together with the compassion and patience of Cristina, who tolerated my restless evenings to exhaustion, I have the pleasure to release this book, hoping that you will find an inspiration to discuss, improve, and contribute to the testing and web development community.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The Testing Mindset">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Testing Mindset</em></span>, starts by defining the concepts used throughout the book, tries to explain why testing is so important, introduces the major testing techniques, and shows you how to get into the right mindset to approach this book.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Tooling up for Testing">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tooling up for Testing</em></span>, introduces Yii 2 with an overview for you to understand how the code is organized. We also start defining the work that will be carried over to the remaining chapters from the testing perspective.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Entering Codeception">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Entering Codeception</em></span>, introduces Codeception and explains what it does, how it's structured, and how it works.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Isolated Component Testing with PHPUnit">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Isolated Component Testing with PHPUnit</em></span>, demonstrates PHPUnit. The first unit tests are implemented in this chapter, with the help of data providers.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Summoning the Test Doubles">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Summoning the Test Doubles</em></span>, introduces test doubles with the use of mocks and stubs, while still sticking to PHPUnit. We also appreciate an alternative BDD-like syntax to write our tests.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Testing the API – PHPBrowser to the Rescue">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Testing the API – PHPBrowser to the Rescue</em></span>, gives an overview of functional tests and then shows their expansion relative to the REST interface that Yii 2 allows you to create.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Having Fun Doing Browser Testing">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Having Fun Doing Browser Testing</em></span>, finally shows some live action with acceptance tests using Selenium WebDriver.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Analyzing Testing Information">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Analyzing Testing Information</em></span>, covers some more advanced topics about tests and code optimization techniques, thanks to the reports generated by Codeception and other tools.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Eliminating Stress with the Help of Automation">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Eliminating Stress with the Help of Automation</em></span>, is a more advanced chapter and introduces continuous integration with the aim of automating tests and displaying their reports using Jenkins CI.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book requires very little to start with. If you've got a decent development machine, the only other thing that you need to install and set up for yourself is a LAMP stack.</p><p>If you've worked in this field previously, you might be already aware that there are many other variants that allow you to use a perfectly compatible LAMP stack, such as Nginx, PostgreSQL, or something else. You can even run everything in a VPS or a virtual machine sitting on your local hard drive. This book does not come with instructions on how to set up everything as you need, so be prepared to get something up and running before opening the browser.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>Given the required understanding of the underlying software and service layer, this book can be approached by anyone with some experience in web development and knowledge of OOPHP programming. A seasoned programmer should have no problems approaching this book, as it can be considered a way of increasing and reaffirming their knowledge in testing techniques and practices.</p><p>Even though it will be beneficial to have knowledge of testing, it's not strictly required because every aspect of it will be covered, from the theoretical side to the deeply practical side.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Remember, there's always a <code class="literal">README.md</code> file you can consult."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">if (YII_ENV_DEV) {
    // configuration adjustments for 'dev' environment
    $config['bootstrap'][] = 'debug';
    $config['modules']['debug'] = 'yii\debug\Module';</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// tests/codeception.yml
...
config:
    test_entry_url: <span class="strong"><strong>https://basic.yii2.sandbox/index-test.php</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ cd tests/codeception</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Just remember to tick the <span class="strong"><strong>Overwrite</strong></span> checkbox and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span>."</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
