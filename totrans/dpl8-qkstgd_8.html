<p>So far in this book, we've learned about many of the things that can be done to quickly get a Drupal site up: creating content types, fields, and content; managing users; adding modules; providing translations; and creating feeds for other sites to consume. With all of these topics, there are still a few left to cover, and that becomes evident when we look at our home page.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are many things about our home page that are bad, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-332 image-border" src="assets/440c78a0-d856-4332-b9b1-3dcda424ec6e.png" style="width:23.08em;height:56.58em;"/></p>
<p>Some, the design-related ones, are out of the scope of this book, but there are others that we can address. Let's make a list of what's bad about our home page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much content!</li>
<li>There is no access to the content that is not on the home page</li>
<li>Our RSS feeds menu needs to be added</li>
<li>The footer menu says Legal instead of <span class="packt_screen">Terms and Conditions</span></li>
<li>The Legal link leads back to the home page</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, let's take our list and consider the deficiencies and what can be done to remedy them. </p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Too much content!</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Drupal is a content management system, of course, but that doesn't mean that all the content should be on the home page. It becomes too long and cluttered. It's better to show only one complete piece or a small number of teasers.</p>
<p>There is a view that provides the selection of content for the home page. Its default behavior is to include all content that has been promoted by checking its <span class="packt_screen">Promote to front page</span> checkbox. So, we could limit the number of pieces displayed by limiting the number of those promoted. Let's be a little more creative.</p>
<p>We will limit the teaser to the most recent piece of promoted content and create a block that offers the others as a list of links.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">No access to content</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is the opposite problem of the first one. If we're going to show the most recent piece of content, and a handful of others in a list, what about the content that is older than that? This is a dilemma suited for the same solution you often see with a blog: an archive. We'll create one to show the older content.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>This is an easy one to resolve. We have already created a custom block that provides a menu for our RSS feeds. All we will need to do is place this block on the home page.</p>

<p>The footer menu has a <em><span class="packt_screen">Legal</span></em> link, which leads back to the home page. We'll change it to the heading we want, and create a page to link to it.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Improving the Frontpage view</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Navigate to <em><span class="packt_screen">Structure</span></em> | <em><span class="packt_screen">Views</span></em> (<kbd>/admin/structure/views</kbd>). Scroll down to the <em><span class="packt_screen">Frontpage</span></em> view. This is one of the views that comes with Drupal. We could modify it, but it is a good practice to leave the original unchanged and, instead, make a duplicate to modify, which is what we'll do here:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the drop-down in its row, select <em><span class="packt_screen">Duplicate</span></em>.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">View name</span> text box that then appears, change the name to <kbd>Frontpage - Custom</kbd> and click <em><span class="packt_screen">Duplicate</span></em>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">View</span> configuration page, we will change the number of items that the view displays. It is currently configured to show 10 items and a pager, but we will change it to show only one. Click <em><span class="packt_screen">Full</span></em> and select <em><span class="packt_screen">This page (override)</span></em> from the drop-down. Select the setting for <em><span class="packt_screen">Display a specified number of items</span></em>, and click <em><span class="packt_screen">Apply (this display)</span></em>.</li>
<li>In the <em><span class="packt_screen">Pager options</span></em> dialog, change the <em><span class="packt_screen">Items per page</span></em> to <kbd>1</kbd>, click <em><span class="packt_screen">Apply</span></em>, and then click <em><span class="packt_screen">Save</span></em>.</li>
<li>Return to the views list at <kbd>/admin/structure/views</kbd>. If you look at the list, you will see that the original <em><span class="packt_screen">Frontpage</span></em> and our <em><span class="packt_screen">Frontpage - Custom</span></em> both have the same path.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>The path needs to be <kbd>/node</kbd> for technical reasons, but we cannot have two views responding to the same path. Therefore, in the row for the original Frontpage, select <em><span class="packt_screen">Disable</span></em> from the drop-down.</li>
<li>This change will ensure that only the most recent piece of content. Let's edit our new view so that we can add an additional display to it. The current display is for the home page, but we also want a display that provides a block of title links for additional content.</li>
<li>On its configuration page, click the <em><span class="packt_screen">+Add</span></em> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Displays</span> panel, and select <em><span class="packt_screen">Block</span></em>.</li>

<p>Earlier, we created a RSS feeds block display in a view. Let's add that block to our home page now.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>We want to fix the Legal link. One of the things we need to fix is that it is currently linking to the home page rather than a Terms and Conditions page. Drupal will not allow a path to be specified for the menu item unless the path already exists. Therefore, we need to create a Terms and Conditions page first.</p>
<p>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Content</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Create content</span> (<kbd>/node/add</kbd>) and select <span class="packt_screen">Basic page</span> as the content type. In the <span class="packt_screen">Title</span> text box, enter <kbd>Terms &amp; Conditions</kbd>. We're not going to enter the legalese at this point, but let's type <kbd>Placeholder</kbd> in the <span class="packt_screen">Body</span> field for now. Click the vertical tab for <span class="packt_screen">URL Path Settings</span>, enter <kbd>/termsandconditions</kbd>, and click <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>.</p>
<p>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Structure</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Menus</span> (<kbd>/admin/structure/menu</kbd>) and click the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> menu button for the <span class="packt_screen">Footer</span> menu.</p>
<p>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> button for the Legal link, and change the title from Legal to <span class="packt_screen">Terms &amp; Conditions</span>. For the Link, type Terms, and then when the autocomplete field offers the content title, click it. Enter <kbd>T's &amp; C's</kbd> in the <span class="packt_screen">Description</span> text box and click <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>.</p>
<p>This completes our improvements. </p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned how to improve a weak home page by editing its view, providing an archive and recent content block, and change the footer menu. </p>
<p>This completes <em>Drupal 8 Quickstart</em>. I hope this book has helped you get your site up and running as well as helped your understanding of basic Drupal features. Thanks for reading!</p>
