<p>In <a href="0e267591-f89d-45a3-9dbd-6ad0b28c20bc.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Developing Cohort-Based Courses with Teacher-Student Interaction</em></span>, we affirmed that when developing courses that are cohort-based and include teacher-student interaction, it's very important to maintain clarity with respect to course organization and also to establish excellent communication.</p>
<p>Similarly, in student-centered project-based courses, it's important to maintain clarity and good communication. It's also important to keep things as straightforward and simple as possible in terms of the activities you'll ask your students to do. After all, it can be complicated and confusing in the online environment if you have too many places to go and things to do at the same time.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you'll learn how to best set up a student-centered project-based course. We'll focus on a few key components you can use for a successful course and also review open source applications that students can use when they collaborate to create documents, audio files, presentations, and videos. Our goal is to help you, as an instructor, administrator, instructional designer, or Moodle support to quickly and easily design and launch courses.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring global settings for student-centered project-based courses</li>
<li>Including competency-based education</li>
<li>Choosing the best activities and resources</li>
<li>Ensuring that the activities are connected to the assessments</li>
<li>Selecting open source applications for students to use when creating collaborative projects</li>
<li>Configuring the course to allow effective instructor and peer feedback</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The traditional face-to-face college course is a cohort course and has a fixed number of students who progress together to complete it, and they're led by an instructor who guides them and also provides feedback and assesses student projects.</p>
<p>Online courses can be very similar. The only difference might be that there are more ways to communicate with each other since you're working in an online environment, and the students may be working together for one class or taking a series of classes together.</p>
<p>In order to prepare students to work together in the global, distributed workplace of today, let's take the example of the fictional Centennial University. Centennial University has built-in collaborative projects in all their online courses. In the Leadership and Strategic Thinking course, for example, students must collaborate to analyze a business situation and create a presentation as well as documents, audio, and a video. While it is possible to modify a course shell from a regular instructor-led cohort course, it is a complex process. So, to optimize the experience for the users and improve the course functionality, a new shell is created for all courses so that they are ideal for collaborative projects.</p>
<p>When considering how to configure the course, the Centennial University online team meets with instructors, instructional designers, instructional technologists, and the Moodle administration team. Before they create the shell, they need to review the main attributes.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of student-centered project-based online courses include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A common start and end date</li>
<li>A clear timeline, with milestones</li>
<li>Collaborative activities that involve students working together in groups</li>
<li>Accessible feedback from peers and instructors</li>
<li>A space for students to share files and edit each other's files</li>
<li>Projects that require students to learn new skills and achieve higher standards of quality (audio editing, image editing, incorporating geographic information, and so on)</li>
</ul>
<p>Student projects can take many forms, or include portfolios. The key feature is that there are many different versions that are built over time and constant review and revision allows one to build on prior knowledge and develop self-awareness.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>You can learn more about learning portfolios in <span class="emphasis"><em>The Learning Portfolio: Reflective Practice for Improving Student Learning</em></span> at <a href="http://www.uwstout.edu/soe/profdev/resources/upload/learningportfolio_000.pdf">http://www.uwstout.edu/soe/profdev/resources/upload/learningportfolio_000.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>The key to success in a student-centered project-based course is performance and interaction between students and the instructor. In the case of exit exam requirements,  it may also be necessary to incorporate competency-based education. Starting with Moodle 3.2, Moodle's themes such as <strong>Boost </strong>includes the ability to incorporate competency frameworks. </p>

<p>Let's continue with the case of the hypothetical Centennial University. As the team members discussed how best to create a template that they could use for all courses that have student projects, a few must-have elements emerged. The two most important considerations in a student-centered project-based course are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple structure</strong>: The main focal point needs to be the collaborative space tied to a clear timeline with milestones. Avoid too many distractions such as quizzes and games.</li>
<li><strong>Clear communication</strong>: Students should always have a way to ask and answer questions as they work independently or with other members of a collaborative group.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can make sure that we achieve the goals of clarity and communication by selecting a framework that gives us the ability to customize the appearance of the course.</p>

<p>We have discussed how to set up the calendar in previous chapters. The process for a project-based course is the same; however, you'll need to make sure that you put in more milestones and reminders in order to stay on track. Keep in mind that the calendar can be a powerful tool for goal-setting. </p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Competency-based education</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Many colleges and universities have been incorporating competency-based education, as a response to a rising demand from the public and taxpayers to have learners demonstrate the fact that they have learned something. For those familiar with US K-12 education, competency-based education is nothing new, and it forms the foundation of No Child Left Behind Act, 2001. </p>
<p>Beginning with Moodle 3.2, it is now possible to incorporate competency frameworks that correspond with standards. Competency frameworks are hierarchical lists of competencies. These competencies are generally defined by a standards body or central authority. In some cases, they are developed by governmental agencies. In others, they are developed by professional societies or associations. One of the nice aspects of Moodle's competencies is that you can individualize them so that you can tie the course competencies to an individual learning plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Site</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">administration</span><span> </span>menu.</li>
<li>Click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Competencies</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-417 image-border" src="assets/e5e74b9f-0a3b-4b3f-808b-b13bb4f1ce49.png" style="width:60.92em;height:29.50em;"/></p>
<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Competencies settings</span>. You'll have the chance to enable competencies (including core competencies). You'll also have the opportunity to push your course ratings or results to your individual learning plan. Doing so allows you to complete your individual learning plan, which can be a key element in your overall portfolio.  </p>
<p>If your <span class="packt_screen">individual learning plan</span> is a part of a <span class="packt_screen">portfolio</span>,<strong> </strong>it is, in essence, a project:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-418 image-border" src="assets/f30547ca-0bca-4ad2-b2e2-92e5554eebdf.png" style="width:85.33em;height:19.33em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Individual learning plan</div>
<p>To use competency frameworks, you'll need to have them available to you through Moodle. So, you will need to import a competency framework, or export one that you already have in one course. To start, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li> Click on <span class="packt_screen">Import competency framework</span>.</li>
<li>If you do not have frameworks, which are in CSV files, you will need to import one from a repository where you have saved one:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2e262373-9f78-4292-85e1-1d8e8c780978.png"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Competency Frameworks</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>You may search for competency frameworks already in CSV format. One convenient place to search is in MoodleNet: <a href="https://moodle.net/mod/data/view.php?d=12&amp;mode=asearch">https://moodle.net/mod/data/view.php?d=12&amp;mode=asearch</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>You may search frameworks using MoodleNet's search box. A simple search, <em>math</em>, yielded a number of options.</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-420 image-border" src="assets/c0526521-0685-4d10-ba96-7f42fb8017c8.png" style="width:85.33em;height:27.25em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You can now import the standards in CSV format. In some cases, you may need to set up an account on GitHub, which is a repository of codes used by developers. </li>
<li>After you have imported the competency framework, you can incorporate it into a Learning Plan Template:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Boost</strong> is a very popular theme that was rewritten for Moodle 3.2 and is now the default. It is a core theme and is standard. However, you may wish to use a different theme. As we have mentioned in previous chapters, you may wish to use MoodleCloud and the <strong>Moodlecloud theme</strong>, which is built on the <strong>Clean theme</strong>.<strong> </strong>If you're a long-time Moodle user, you may prefer MoodleCloud. </p>

Alternatively, we can select <span class="packt_screen">Workshop</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Add an Activity</span> menu.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at the settings of <span class="packt_screen">Workshop</span>. The default settings will probably work well for you, but you may want to pay attention to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum submission attachment size</strong>: The default value of this option depends on the site settings and the server settings, and it could be too small for attachments containing audio, video, or a number of images. You may wish to use Google Drive, which allows up to 15 GB of space, or another cloud storage service.</li>
<li><strong>Number of reviews</strong>: The default value of this option is usually <span class="packt_screen">5</span>. You may want more.</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is a good moment to talk about how the calendar can be used to set goals and to motivate your team members. Using the calendar for the milestones and to specify an individual team member's tasks will help you keep everyone on task. It is useful for tracking progress and asking for help when one person slips behind and misses deadlines.</p>
<p>Be sure to recognize and reward the timely completion of tasks. You can set the calendar to reflect key timeline dates, and you can build in a space to insert emoticons or other encouraging icons. </p>
<p>Badges can also be used to motivate students. For example, one can develop a badge to be awarded at the completion of key milestones. To do so, go to <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span>. Select <span class="packt_screen">Badges</span>, and from the menu, select <span class="packt_screen">Manage badges</span>, shown as follows: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-423 image-border" src="assets/36604a35-2872-4b0d-bcf9-66215c6d0f69.png" style="width:77.33em;height:26.08em;"/></p>
<p>When you click <span class="packt_screen">Add a new badge</span>, you can describe the work that the badge entailed. You can also include an image for your badge. Notice that I'm using the Moodlecloud theme here and in the next screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-424 image-border" src="assets/e3515af7-7dba-47e2-a86d-85ace17d35d5.png" style="width:35.67em;height:28.00em;"/></p>
<p>As you continue to configure the badge, you will need to determine when it is awarded and who can determine when the badge has been earned. The simplest approach is to designate the <span class="packt_screen">Teacher</span> as the badge awardee, but if it's self-paced course, you'll want to set it up so that it is earned upon successful completion of a designated activity:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-425 image-border" src="assets/98d6bb03-bf59-48df-8ea1-0abc615d65a7.png" style="width:42.50em;height:15.92em;"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Notice that we can choose <span class="packt_screen">Manual issue by role</span>. That allows you to select individuals to release the badge, which can be a good idea in the case of highly subjective criteria.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">So, once you've designated the <span class="packt_screen">Teacher</span> as the individual who can release the badge, you can now enable access. Notice that once you've done so, the image that you selected for your badge shows up on the left of the title block for your badge. You may wish to select simpler, clearer graphics than I have done. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>First, we will add a course. Remember that we learned how to do that in <a href="1c74867a-d7a0-440e-bec9-043057634f02.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="1c74867a-d7a0-440e-bec9-043057634f02.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, Preparing to Build an Exemplary Moodle Course,</em></span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, where you can add a course by creating it within one of the categories you've created. </p>
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Manage courses and categories</span>. The <span class="packt_screen">Course and category management</span> page appears, displaying the <span class="packt_screen">Course categories</span> list as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426 image-border" src="assets/4250d25f-2c7a-491b-8110-416dae350ba5.png" style="width:37.83em;height:22.08em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now, click on a category and then select <span class="packt_screen">Create new course</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Edit course settings</span> page, enter the mandatory details in the <span class="packt_screen">Course full name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Course short name</span> fields and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we're ready to set up the course so that it will work well for students collaborating on projects. Let's keep it simple to avoid confusion. The following are the ideal settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">ADMINISTRATION</span> block, go to <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Edit settings</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Edit Course settings</span> page, select the course format <span class="packt_screen">Topics format</span>, and then add at least two additional topics: one for the instructional materials you will use in the course and the other for sample projects and links to open source applications.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> section, set <span class="packt_screen">Show gradebook to students</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span>.</li>
<li>Set <span class="packt_screen">Enable completion tracking</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span>.</li>
<li>Make sure you include groups by selecting <span class="packt_screen">Visible groups</span> under <span class="packt_screen">Groups</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Group mode</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span> button.</li>

<p>If your students are creating collaborative presentations, they will need to be able to edit and add audio, video, and text files. They will also need to integrate geographical data.</p>
<p>In previous chapters, we discussed creating links to word processing, spreadsheets, and presentation tools. Now, let's look at open source and free tools for audio and video.</p>

<p>The following are a few free, and often open source, tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audacity</strong>: Audacity is a wonderful program for creating and editing audio files. You may download and install it on your own computer, and it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. For more information and to download it, please visit <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>LAME</strong>: To convert Audacity projects to MP3 files, you'll need to use an MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) encoder. LAME is very effective. For more information and to download it, please visit <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">http://lame.sourceforge.net/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>LibriVox Checker</strong>: LibriVox has made available a program that checks volume. It's extremely useful and easy to use. It also checks file formatting, though this is a feature you may not need to use. For more information, please visit <a href="http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Checker">http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Checker</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Google Earth</strong>: Google Earth is probably the easiest and best-known open source geographical information systems and is very helpful for supplying maps and locations for collaborative projects. To see the terms and conditions and to download it, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/download/ge/agree.html">http://www.google.com/earth/download/ge/agree.html</a>.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Video Editor</strong>: YouTube's video editor is very easy to use, and it's free. It is not as complicated as other free video editors and does not have controls like those of Camtasia, but it's excellent for collaborations because it's uncomplicated and allows you to add transcripts for compliance with regulations concerned with ensuring that people with disabilities have access to the information being presented. You may upload text or rely on YouTube's built-in speech recognition software, which can be very effective if there is not much background noise. The YouTube video editor is available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/editor">http://www.youtube.com/editor</a>.</li>

<p>As we configure the courses and global settings, let's review the activities, which are plugins in Moodle.</p>
<p>The main activities that we will use are forum, workshop, and wiki. Since we already know how to set up a discussion forum, we will not review how to add a forum to a topic. Instead, we'll focus on workshop and wiki.</p>

<p>Let's return to the case of courses for tourism. The team is now looking at the best ways for students to work collaboratively, which means that they will work together to create and edit files, comment on them, and evaluate them. After reviewing the activities available through Moodle, two were identified as ideal for tourism-focused online courses that require collaboration on projects.</p>
<p>The two activities the team members decided on were workshop and wiki. The workshop ability to let students submit work and then grade their own work and also that of their fellow students was perfect for the university's needs.</p>
<p>Wiki was selected because it allows students to collaborate quickly and easily, and the final results can incorporate collaboratively edited text as well as contributed video, audio, and images from members of the team.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the Centennial University team found that building a workshop activity in Moodle courses is easy to do and that it provides a chance for students to create documents, which they then submit and assess. The assessments are reflected directly in gradebook, which appears automatically when the submission is set up. The following steps show you how to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the topic that aligns most closely with the one in which you want to place your collaborative project.</li>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Add an activity or resource</span> menu and choose <span class="packt_screen">Workshop</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Adding a new Workshop</span> page, expand <span class="packt_screen">General</span>.</li>
<li>Fill in the following fields: <span class="packt_screen">Workshop name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Description</span>.</li>
<li>Open <span class="packt_screen">Submission settings</span> and fill in the fields for <span class="packt_screen">Instructions for submission</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Maximum number of submission attachments</span>, among others.</li>
<li>Then, in <span class="packt_screen">Assessment settings</span>, be sure to fill the field titled <span class="packt_screen">Instructions for assessment</span>.</li>
<li>In <span class="packt_screen">Example submissions</span>, select the checkbox to allow example submissions for practice in assessing.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that most of the fields will be already set as the default (which you established while configuring the global settings).</li>
</ol>
<p>The beauty of a workshop activity is that it allows students to learn from each other and to learn from their mistakes. When they assess their own work or their peers' work, they enter comments in accordance with instructions, which can be posted in <span class="packt_screen">Instructions for assessment</span>. You can enter instructions from <span class="packt_screen">Adding a Workshop</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Assessment settings</span> expandable link, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429 image-border" src="assets/898fcefd-0bde-4a15-9c4b-6dc6211e6143.png" style="width:34.83em;height:32.92em;"/></p>
<p>When the students read the comments, they can then apply the suggestions and insights to a revision of the documents that we have created for students to assess. The revision can be submitted as well, which allows more feedback and reflection on one's work and can be enhanced through the <span class="packt_screen">Feedback</span> expandable link, which allows you to select the number of feedback attachments and the feedback size and write a conclusion that appears in the gradebook, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-430 image-border" src="assets/6255d808-050b-4781-af99-1afd91addd4e.png" style="width:35.17em;height:19.00em;"/></p>
<p>Moodle allows you to review your setup and continue adding details or modifying what you've included.</p>

<p>The Centennial University College of Business has decided to implement a wiki activity in their courses to help students learn key terms in a way that allows them to interact with fellow students and foster engagement with the course matter. For example, in the Tour Trends course, students collaborate in an Airbnb Social Media Marketing Strategy wiki. All students must post examples of social media and then contribute examples.</p>
<p>Moodle's wiki activity is ideal for that purpose. Wikis promote student engagement by also including social interaction with their fellow learners. The wiki assignment should enable learners to satisfy their curiosity and research topics that are intrinsically interesting to them. In creating their wikis, students create HTML documents collaboratively and review each other's additions and changes.</p>
<p>Wikis are good for encouraging students to gain in-depth knowledge of a concept by taking a hands-on, collaborative approach. To get started, go to the topic that aligns most closely to the one in which you want to place your wiki and perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Adding a new Wiki</span> page, expand <span class="packt_screen">General</span>.</li>
<li>Fill in the following fields: <span class="packt_screen">Wiki name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Description</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Wiki mode</span> dropdown and select <span class="packt_screen">Collaborative wiki</span>.</li>
<li>Then, in <span class="packt_screen">Common module settings</span>, set <span class="packt_screen">Visible</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Show</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save and return to course</span> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have edited the settings in your wiki, you can make it available for students. Students can click on <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> and then add, delete, or comment on the entry. To see who has added or deleted content, they can click on <span class="packt_screen">History</span> and see who has contributed and when: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431 image-border" src="assets/8dcf75d5-8399-4581-a953-3c81672c33d9.png" style="width:84.83em;height:41.67em;"/></p>
<p>Once the students have finished contributing to the wiki, the instructor can grade the activity and determine grades based on the quality and quantity of student contributions. The instructor can click on <span class="packt_screen">Comments</span> at any time during the process in order to give guidance. If it's done well, a wiki can create a wonderful sense of pride and camaraderie and be very motivating as well as informative.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned the best way to develop and configure your student-centered, project-based courses. We focused on the fact that students will need a very clear structure to manage their projects and that you'll need to provide support in terms of links to applications that they may need in order to perform their collaborative activities.</p>
<p>We took special note of how Moodle incorporated competency-based education and competency frameworks after Moodle 3.2. Competency-based education can be a part of a portfolio or project-focused course, particularly if there is a standardized exit exam, and it is important to prepare the student for them. </p>
<p>We looked at the importance of having an easy-to-modify, flexible, responsive theme so that the course has a good look and feel on all devices.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will guide you through using Moodle to create online communities, which will use the flexibility of Moodle to develop new ways of training and knowledge transfer.</p>
