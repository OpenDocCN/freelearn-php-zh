However, this rapid development requires the ability to organize common tasks together to build a complete application. It's all too easy to get confused about the use of these technologies.</p><p>So, walking through practical examples will help you understand how these concepts must be used and realize a successful application.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

Next, we will find out how to use Gii and get to know about the advantages it has in creating models from the database table structure. Gii creates models that extend the ActiveRecord class, and, through its use, we will finally learn how to manipulate data.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Using a Grid for Data and Relations">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using a Grid for Data and Relations</em></span>, presents the GridView widget for displaying data, directly or relationed. A fundamental topic inside GridView is Data Provider, the way to provide data to GridView. We will learn how to get Data Provider from ActiveRecord, Array, or SQL, based on the available sources.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Working on the User Interface">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working on the User Interface</em></span>, discusses the User Interface and how Yii helps us with its core functionalities.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Log in to the App">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Log in to the App</em></span>, shows how to apply user authentication and authorization to an app. The first step is to create authenticated access to the application. For this purpose, we will create a database table to manage users and associate it to the Yii user component through a user model that extends IdentityInterface.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Frontend to Display Rooms to Everyone">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Frontend to Display Rooms to Everyone</em></span>, explains how to use Yii to build a modern web project based on frontend and backend applications.
