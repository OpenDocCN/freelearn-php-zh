You should be able to guide them and respond to their concerns if you want to be a good, understanding, and helpful host to the community. That’s why it’s a good idea to know in detail how your phpBB-powered forum works.<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If you’ve just jumped from the previous chapter, you may be still logged in as an administrator. Log out and let’s get started with the tour of the new forum walking in visitor’s shoes.</p><div class="section" title="Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec01"/>Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>If somebody hits the forum you’ve just created following the steps from the previous chapter, they are very likely to see something like the following:<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_01.jpg" alt="Overview"/></div><p>This screenshot shows how phpBB gets shipped, with all defaults and a test posting in a test forum. The only registered user of the board is the admin user that you created while installing. At the top of the screen, next to the phpBB logo, there’s a set of links that go together with some small icon images. These links represent the main navigation of the forum. One of the links is the link to register and become a member of the community. Off we go!</p></div><div class="section" title="Registration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec02"/>Registration</h2></div></div></div><p>There are three steps to the registration procedure—reading and accepting the registration terms, filling out the user profile form, and (optionally) a registration confirmation by e-mail.<a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Step 1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec01"/>Step 1</h3></div></div></div><p>When the visitors select the<span class="strong"><strong> Register</strong></span> link from the top menu, they are presented with the "Registration Agreement Terms". There are three options they can choose from:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Accept the terms and be 13 years old or older: This option triggers the standard registration procedure.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Accept the terms and be younger than 13 years: This option is the same as the one above with one more addition. In compliance with COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998) regulations, a parent or guardian needs to send a standard form to you, the forum administrator, by mail or e-mail. This form grants permission for the child to participate in the forums. A blank COPPA form is sent by phpBB to the e-mail address supplied during the registration.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dont agree to the terms: Choosing this option aborts the registration process and the visitor is redirected to the main forum page.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Step 2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec02"/>Step 2</h3></div></div></div><p>When the visitor accepts the phpBB terms, the registration form is displayed. The exact meaning of each of the fields in this registration/profile forms will be described shortly.

If there are validation errors, like incorrect syntax for e-mail address or password mismatch, information about the error will be displayed at the top of the form. On an error-free and successful registration, a "thank-you" screen is displayed. Depending on how the board is configured (see the<span class="strong"><strong> Email Address</strong></span> field’s explanation in the table shown in the<span class="emphasis"><em> Editing Your Profile</em></span> section that follows), the thank-you screen might advise the users to check their e-mail for a confirmation message in order to complete the registration.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Logging In"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec03"/>Logging In</h2></div></div></div><p>After successful registration, the user can log in using the form at the bottom of the forum’s front page.<a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>

<p>E-mail address*</p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>User’s e-mail address. The forum can be configured to request a registration confirmation by e-mail in order to activate a user account. If such confirmation is required, an e-mail is sent to the address provided in this field. Many phpBB administrators opt for e-mail confirmation just to make sure that users enter valid e-mail addresses. This has a very good reason—if you don’t require the e-mail confirmation and users register with fake e-mail addresses, you’ll start receiving lots of bounced messages to your admin e-mail address. Why these bouncing messages? Well, phpBB will send e-mails on your account (you’ll be the sender), for private-message notifications, topics-watch notifications, and so on, and on mail-delivery failures due to wrong recipient addresses, these mails bounce back to the sender.</p>

<p>Confirm password*</p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>phpBB requests the password to be confirmed just for the users to verify that they’ve entered their intended password correctly. A note about the passwords: they are encrypted before they are saved to the database using the MD5 one-way encryption algorithm. In plain English: there’s no way for a saved password to be retrieved; at least the modern computer algorithms are not capable of doing it. This means that only the users know their passwords. If a user forgets a password, there’s a procedure to create a new password, but none to restore the old one.</p>

<p>As the form says, this section of the registration contains information that is publicly viewable by all community members, even those that are not registered. Part of it accompanies every post the user writes, part of it is only displayed when somebody accesses the user profile page. This section contains, for example, user data about their ICQ, AOL, MSN, and Yahoo! Messenger services and some other personal data.</p>
<p>There is a special field called signature. The text in this field is appended to the bottom of every post made by the user. It can contain links, URLs, and formatting, and is often used to add a touch of personality. People use it for various reasons like favorite wisdom quotes, funny quotes, or self-advertising. The way people use it can sometimes vary depending on what the community is about. In some rare occasions, it can actually be used for its original purpose—to contain the name of the poster or anything that looks like a real signature. The way to format a signature is the same as that to format a normal posting, which will be discussed a bit further.</p>

</p><div class="section" title="Anatomy of a Posting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec05"/>Anatomy of a Posting</h3></div></div></div><p>Let’s see what a posting looks like, and what different elements it is composed of:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_05.jpg" alt="Anatomy of a Posting"/></div><p>The<span class="emphasis"><em> Author information</em></span> box consists of author’s nickname, joined-in date, number of posts, and location. It can also contain the avatar image, rank, and rank image, but these are not enabled by default. Ranks and avatars are discussed a bit later.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Post meta information</em></span> consists of one tiny post graphic, date/time stamp, and post subject. This teeny tiny graphic (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_06.jpg" alt="Anatomy of a Posting"/></span>) is so small that most people won’t even notice it, and even if they do, they would think it’s just an ornament. But it’s in fact a functional graphic; it’s an exact link to this post. It’s not very likely that someone would want to go to the post they are reading at the moment, but this can be very useful when you want to give a link to a specific post, as opposed to a link to the topic in general. To get the exact URL of a posting, right-click this miniature graphic and copy the URL that it links to. The graphic can also be different in color, which has a meaning. In the default phpBB template, an orange-colored box denotes that it’s an unread post, whereas a white-gray box means that user has already read this post.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Actions area</em></span> contains buttons for the actions available to the user for this posting. The <code class="literal">quote</code> button is always there, and it looks like this: <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_07.jpg" alt="Anatomy of a Posting"/></span> Another action button that can be available is the <code class="literal">edit</code> button, which looks like this: <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_08.jpg" alt="Anatomy of a Posting"/></span> Whether the <code class="literal">edit</code> button is available depends on the user privileges, but in the default phpBB forum configuration, an author can edit his or her postings and a moderator can edit everybody’s postings. The author can also have a delete action, depending on the privileges and the specific posting. The default phpBB configuration allows the author of the post to delete it only if there are no more posts after that. Moderators have access to all action buttons—quote, edit, delete, and the button to view the poster’s IP address.</p><p>The<span class="emphasis"><em> Post text</em></span> area contains the actual text of the message and the<span class="emphasis"><em> signature</em></span> area contains the user’s signature in his/her profile.</p><p>The<span class="emphasis"><em> Top link</em></span> is just a "Back to the top" link leading to the beginning of the current page.</p><p>The<span class="emphasis"><em> Contact author options</em></span> area at the very least contains a button to access the author’s profile and a button to send the author a<span class="strong"><strong> private message</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PM</strong></span>). This area can also contain other information as entered in the profile: the e-mail address, ICQ number, MSN messenger ID, web address, and so on. The nice thing about the ICQ button is that it will show the ICQ status of the author (online or offline) provided of course that the author is allowing the status to be viewed in the ICQ settings.</p></div><div class="section" title="Replying"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec06"/>Replying</h3></div></div></div><p>A reply is a new posting in an existing discussion topic.

A reply can also be initiated by clicking the <code class="literal">Quote</code> action button, mentioned earlier, located in a post’s actions area.

Emoticons (mostly known as smilies) are those cute little images that help the users add a touch of personal and informal look to their postings. Clicking one of these graphics on the left will insert its textual representation in the message-body field. For example, if you click <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_11.jpg" alt="Replying"/></span>,you’ll see <code class="literal">:D</code> inserted in the textbox, as shown in the preceding screenshot.
</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">
The blue text <code class="literal">View more Emoticons</code> is actually a link to a new window popup with more smilies to choose from.

When posting, you insert these tags here and there in the post body, and when you view a post, the tags are processed to produce the desired formatting. If you know some basic HTML tags, chances are you’ll have a pretty good idea of how the BB tags work and you can start typing them almost right away.<a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If you don’t know either HTML or BB tags (and most of your visitors won’t know them), don’t worry; you don’t have to learn this whole new secret code by heart. phpBB has an intuitive interface to guide you through this almost as easily as using a word-processing software. Just looking at the formatting toolbar should make most of the options clear.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_14.jpg" alt="Formatting a Posting"/></div><p>There are two ways to apply a formatting: you can either type the tags out, or you can select the word or phrase you want to format and then click the appropriate button from the toolbar. Unfortunately, due to different JavaScript support in the different browsers, the second option is not available in some browsers or platforms. But the good news is that about 95% of all Internet users will have access to this feature, because they’ll be using a browser that supports it.</p><p>There is always an<span class="strong"><strong> opening BB tag</strong></span> that shows where to start the formatting and a<span class="strong"><strong> closing BB tag</strong></span> that shows where the formatting should end. The opening tag is of the form<code class="literal"> [tag]</code> and the closing of the form<code class="literal"> [/tag]</code>. Let’s take a look at the bold tag, as it’s probably the tag that’s used the most. If you want to bold the word "fun" in the sentence "Posting is fun", you type (or use the toolbar to produce the same result) "<code class="literal">Posting is [b]fun[/b]</code>". These tags might look scary if this is your first acquaintance with them, but are really easy once you get used to them.</p><p>You know that you can apply this formatting by typing the sentence, selecting the word "fun", and then clicking the<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> icon. There is another way of using the toolbar to do this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Type<span class="strong"><strong> Posting is</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click the<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> icon (this will insert the opening<code class="literal"> [b]</code>).</li><li class="listitem">Type<span class="strong"><strong> fun</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click the<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> icon again (this will insert the closing<code class="literal"> [/b]</code>).</li></ol></div><p>Unlike the selection method for formatting (described previously), the scenario above will work in almost any browser that knows at least something about JavaScript. After step 2 above, the<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> icon will get an asterisk, indicating that there is an opened<code class="literal"> [b]</code> tag that’s not yet closed. On completion of step 4, the asterisk will disappear.</p><p>Images can be inserted into your postings by using the<code class="literal"> [img]</code> tag, assuming that the image is available on the Internet, i.e. you know its web address that starts with something like<code class="literal"> http://</code>. You can also put web links into the postings, using the<code class="literal"> [url]</code> tag, although phpBB is smart enough to guess when you have a web link in your posting and will automatically display it as a clickable link.</p><p>You can consult the phpBB user guide for more detailed information on the BB tags, but let’s first see an example to get a pretty good idea of how the tags work.</p><p>If you look at the screenshot earlier, which shows the formatting toolbar, you’ll notice that it looks like three distinct lines (or rows), containing respectively:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Formatting command buttons, like<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> for bold,<span class="strong"><strong> I</strong></span> for italics, etc.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Two dropdowns containing font formatting and a<span class="strong"><strong> Close Tags</strong></span> link. This link will close all currently opened tags (assuming they were opened from the toolbar, not typed). For example, if you type<span class="strong"><strong> Posting is</strong></span>, click the<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> button followed by the<span class="strong"><strong> I</strong></span> button, type<span class="strong"><strong> fun</strong></span>, and finally click<span class="strong"><strong> Close Tags</strong></span>, youll get the result:<span class="strong"><strong> Posting is [b][i]fun[/i][/b]</strong></span>. Clicking<span class="strong"><strong> Close Tags</strong></span> has given the same results as clicking<span class="strong"><strong> I</strong></span> and then<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> to close the tags youve already opened.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The third line in the toolbar contains tips on how to use the BB tags. If you place your mouse over a toolbar icon, youll see that the contents of the tips line change to reflect the buttons function. The preceding illustration had the mouse cursor hovering over the<span class="strong"><strong> B</strong></span> button. In brackets, a tip shows a keyboard combination that can be used for formatting. This combination has the same effect as clicking a toolbar button, and can help you post faster using just the keyboard and not even worrying about moving your hand from the keyboard to the mouse, and then moving the mouse to the desired icon.<p>The result from the example can even be achieved using just the keyboard: type<span class="strong"><strong> Posting is</strong></span>, hold the<span class="emphasis"><em> ALT</em></span> key (the Apple key for Mac users), press<span class="emphasis"><em> B</em></span>, press<span class="emphasis"><em> I</em></span>, release<span class="emphasis"><em> ALT</em></span>, type<span class="emphasis"><em> fun</em></span>, hold<span class="emphasis"><em> ALT</em></span>, press<span class="emphasis"><em> I</em></span>, and then press<span class="emphasis"><em> B</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec02"/></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Time For Action—Formatting a Post"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl5sec02"/>Time For Action—Formatting a Post</h5></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You already know how to use the bold and italics formatting tags, but this time lets also add<span class="strong"><strong> underlining</strong></span>. Use your preferred method (the toolbar or the keyboard or simply type the tags yourself) in order to produce the following BB code:<span class="strong"><strong> Posting is [b][i][u]fun[/u][/i][/b]!</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">The next thing is the<span class="strong"><strong> quoting</strong></span>. Normally you would use the<span class="strong"><strong> Quote</strong></span> action button when replying, but it doesnt hurt to know how to do it manually:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">I can quote other posters like this:

</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Now we take a look at the<code class="literal"> [code]</code> tag, which is mostly used when people<span class="strong"><strong> paste programming code</strong></span> into their postings, but can be used for other purposes like better aligning in a table-like manner, because it uses a fixed-width font. Type:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">I can write "phpBB" using binary:

</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Next, the<span class="strong"><strong> listings</strong></span>. Listings use the<code class="literal"> [list]</code> tag to mark the beginning and the end of a listing, and use the asterisk<code class="literal"> [*]</code> for a listing item. The listing start tag can take parameters like<code class="literal"> 1</code> or<code class="literal"> A</code>. Try this:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">And I can list stuff like this:
[list][*]one[*]two[/list]
or even enumerate, like this
[list=1][*]first[*]second[/list]
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Then add an<span class="strong"><strong> image</strong></span> using the<code class="literal"> [img]</code> tag and the web address of a known image, as follows:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">I can use images:

</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Now<span class="strong"><strong> links</strong></span>.

</p><p>After a posting has been edited, a small print message appears at the bottom of the posting, advising other users that this posting has been altered.

This will make it a bit difficult to locate a specific older topic. phpBB’s search feature comes to the rescue here. It’s accessible through the<span class="strong"><strong> Search</strong></span> top-navigation link. The search form gives you many options to find your topic of interest, such as which forum to search, how to display the results, and so on.<a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Chances are you and your members will ignore most of the search options in your searches. After all, we are so used to simple search boxes like Google’s, for example, that we rarely look for other options. But here is one simple option that can help you a lot. This option is<span class="strong"><strong> Search for all terms</strong></span>. It helps when you search using more than one word. Unlike Google, where the results will be narrowed when you add more words, phpBB will search for each individual word and return more results (broadening the search as opposed to narrowing it).</p><p>For example, if you search for<span class="strong"><strong> milk chocolate</strong></span>, you’ll get all results for<span class="strong"><strong> milk</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> chocolate</strong></span>, which is probably not what you want. Checking the<span class="strong"><strong> Search for all terms</strong></span> option will return only those posts where both words can be found.</p><p>You can also use the wildcard (*) for searching a part of a word. For example<span class="strong"><strong> *late</strong></span> will return postings containing the words<span class="strong"><strong> chocolate</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> late</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Sending and Receiving Private Messages (PM)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec07"/>Sending and Receiving Private Messages (PM)</h2></div></div></div><p>One neat phpBB feature is that users can communicate privately with each other<span class="emphasis"><em> outside</em></span> the public board area, through private messages (PM). (PM is also used as a verb, as in "Please PM me".) PMs work very similarly to the normal e-mail we’re all used to. The interface for writing a PM is the same as for writing a posting, only there is a field for the recipient’s username at the top. Also, you can look up a username if you’re not sure about the spelling.<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>There are the following private message boxes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Inbox</strong></span>: Stores all incoming messages, just like in a normal e-mail mailbox.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sentbox</strong></span>: Contains all messages that youve sent to other members.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Outbox</strong></span>: Temporarily contains those messages that youve sent but which have not yet been read by the recipient. You can edit or delete messages in the outbox. As soon as the recipient reads the message, the sender can no longer amend it. At this point its final. Sometimes it can so happen that a user receives an e-mail and a popup window notification about a new PM and when this user goes to the inbox, there are no new messages. This does not happen very often, because the ability to edit or delete messages in the outbox is a somewhat hidden feature that most people are not aware of. But in any event, be prepared to answer the users queries as to why they receive notifications but no messages.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Savebox</strong></span>: Stores sent or received messages. You can move messages to this box from the other boxes.

The possible options for the topic type are as shown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_27.jpg" alt="Editing the First Posting in a Topic"/></div><p>If you post a topic as<span class="strong"><strong> Announcement</strong></span> or<span class="strong"><strong> Sticky</strong></span>, it will stay on the top of the topic listings. One difference between the two types is in the icon that will be displayed next to the topic title. Another (more important) difference is that sticky topics are displayed on the top of the first page of topic listings, while the announcements are on the top of all listing pages. What this means is that if there are so many topics in your forum that they span several pages (a page has 25 topics by default), a topic marked<span class="strong"><strong> Announcement</strong></span> will be on top of<span class="emphasis"><em> all the pages</em></span>, whereas the<span class="strong"><strong> Stickys</strong></span> will be on the top of the<span class="emphasis"><em> first page only</em></span>. Here’s an example of what a sticky topic and an announcement look like.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_28.jpg" alt="Editing the First Posting in a Topic"/></div><p>Another specific thing about editing the first posting in a topic is that you have the option of deleting it in the edit interface.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_29.jpg" alt="Editing the First Posting in a Topic"/></div><p>If a posting contains a poll, the poll can also be edited or deleted.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_30.jpg" alt="Editing the First Posting in a Topic"/></div><p>Here are some other specifics about editing the first post in a topic.

Here is some information that you might find useful:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An IP address is a numeric identifier, unique for every computer connected to the Internet. IP stands for Internet Protocol. Internet Service Providers (ISP) all over the world assign IP addresses to their clients every time an Internet connection is requested. This means that if you connect to the Internet, disconnect, and reconnect, the IP address assigned to you the second time may be different from that assigned the first time.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you click the<span class="strong"><strong> Look up IP address</strong></span> link shown in the above screenshot, phpBB will try to resolve (give a friendlier representation of) the IP address. This feature may not always work, because not all IP addresses can be resolved. In the example above, the numeric IP address will be resolved as shown in the image below:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_32.jpg" alt="Viewing Poster’s IP Address"/></div></li></ul></div><p>The last part of the IP address (<code class="literal">videotron.ca</code>) gives information about the Internet Service Provider (ISP). Some companies have their own IP addresses and they act as if they were their own ISP. Resolving a poster’s IP address can at times give you information about the poster’s employer or the poster’s ISP, or no information if it cannot be resolved. Keep in mind:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">One user can be listed with several IP addresses, and this can happen quite often, because ISPs change the IP addresses assigned to their clients. Also, a member can use more than one computer and Internet connection to post (for example, home and office computers).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Several users may use the same IP address. Maybe the first possibility you think of is that a person has registered a new username and is posting from both usernames. Although its a probable scenario, its not necessarily always the case. Two users may have the same ISP (or may be employed at the same company) and thus may have the same IP address. Another explanation is that two users are friends and one is using the others computer and Internet connection to post. And yet another—two users are posting from the same Internet club (game club, Internet café, etc.).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In the IP information interface, clicking on the username brings up the users profile page.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In the same interface, clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> Search</strong></span> button will list all posts by a particular user.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Managing Topics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec13"/>Managing Topics</h2></div></div></div><p>Managing topics is the second group of options that a moderator has that the regular users don’t. One way to manage a topic is by altering the first posting in this topic. This was discussed in the<span class="emphasis"><em> Managing Postings</em></span> section earlier in this chapter (you might want to go back and take a look; the other options discussed here are strictly topics-related).<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>At the bottom of every topic, a moderator has access to four action icons, as shown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_33.jpg" alt="Managing Topics"/></div><p>In the order that they appear, they mean:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Delete a topic</strong></span>: Remove the topic permanently from the database.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Move a topic</strong></span>: Move the topic from its present forum to another forum.

Don’t worry about the details; they will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. OK, back to moving topics.

Log out now and log back in as The Dude.</p><p>A moderator moves a topic by selecting the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_37.jpg" alt="What Just Happened?"/></span> action icon.

There is also a<span class="strong"><strong> Leave shadow topic in old forum</strong></span> checkbox (checked by default). Select this option to leave in the old forum a link to the new location. The link looks exactly like a normal topic, except that it has<span class="strong"><strong> Moved</strong></span> before the title, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_39.jpg" alt="What Just Happened?"/></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Splitting Topics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec21"/>Splitting Topics</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes a discussion digresses from the original topic; at other times, people discuss two different questions in the same topic—postings start overlapping, and it’s difficult to follow the discussion. To avoid confusion caused by such a situation, a moderator can split the discussion into two topics. To do so, the moderator clicks the split icon <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_40.jpg" alt="Splitting Topics"/></span>.The following special interface for splitting topics is presented:<a id="id70" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_41.jpg" alt="Splitting Topics"/></div><p>Essentially, splitting a topic involves creating a new topic to accommodate some already existing messages, while removing them from the topic under which they were originally posted. Thus said, a new topic needs a title, a forum to reside in, and at least one posting.</p><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Split Topic Control Panel</strong></span>, shows a text field for the title and a dropdown to choose an existing forum. There is a checkbox next to each posting. There are two splitting options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To select each posting individually. Its time-consuming to check each individual posting, but this is an option when two separate questions are discussed in a total overlap.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To select one posting and then split the complete discussion. This is applicable when at some point a discussion takes a totally different direction. In this case, the checked posting is the beginning of the<span class="emphasis"><em> new</em></span> topic.</li></ul></div><p>Two tips:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Especially on heavily loaded boards, its a good idea to temporarily lock a topic before splitting.

You’ve come to the most important part—administering your board. You’ve already seen some of the features described previously in this chapter as well as in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Installing and Configuring phpBB">Chapter 2</a>, but it’s now time to take a more organized approach and make sure you understand what your administrative options are and how to use them.<a id="id72" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>This section will later describe some basic phpBB admin features that you’re likely to use more frequently than others. For more advanced and exotic options, make sure you read <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Forum Administration">Chapter 5</a>, which goes into details about security-related questions, smilies, usergroups, and other issues.</p><p>In order to test what’s being described further on, you need to log in as a user with administrative privileges. There can be multiple administrators to your board, but in any event, at least one administrative user account exists—the account created while installing phpBB. We’ll log in with this account, use the<span class="strong"><strong> Go to Administration Panel</strong></span> link, and let’s start exploring administrative options.</p><div class="section" title="Administration Panel Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec14"/>Administration Panel Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>The Administration Panel has two main areas (referred to as<span class="strong"><strong> frames</strong></span> in HTML terms):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The left-hand navigation area, which contains links to all your administrative options.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_44.jpg" alt="Administration Panel Overview"/></div><p>The Administration Panel front page also has some general statistics about the forum usage and a<span class="strong"><strong> Who is Online</strong></span> section that works in a similar way to the one that visitors can access on the forum homepage (see the<span class="emphasis"><em> Visitor Experience</em></span> section earlier in the chapter), except that this one has an IP address column as well. Clicking on an IP address redirects you to a third-party site that provides some IP-related tools that you may find useful.</p><p>The first three options of the navigation menu are pretty straightforward and you may want to give them a try just to get a more comfortable feeling browsing the Administration Panel. They are not actually administrative options but simply links to the board’s front page and the Administration Panel. The phpBB logo in the top-left corner is also a link to the homepage of the board.</p><p>Now let’s take a closer look into the other groups of options on the navigation menu.</p></div><div class="section" title="Forum Admin"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec15"/>Forum Admin</h2></div></div></div><p>As the title says, this is a group of options for you to administer your forums, to create, edit, delete, or rearrange forums and their categories, as well as to set their options and rules of use (referred to as<span class="strong"><strong> permissions</strong></span>).<a id="id74" class="indexterm"/>

That’s why there is a powerful and options-rich system of permissions and user privileges. You’ll find some more detailed information about the permissions system in Chapter 5, which contains details on some advanced phpBB features. You’ll also find more information in the phpBB user guide. So before you start playing around with the permissions, make sure you know what you’re doing. For now, we’ll just take a quick look into the permissions that are used most often, and leave the details for later.</p><p>There are two modes of setting a forum’s permissions:<span class="strong"><strong> simple</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> advanced</strong></span>. Using the simple mode, you can pick permission patterns (a set of advanced permissions grouped together to be easier to use) from a list of preset values. Example options for simple mode are "Public" forum, "Registered" forum, and "Hidden" forum.</p><p>These simple options are carefully analyzed and selected by the phpBB team, so using them instead of the advanced options is probably the safest thing to do until you are comfortable managing forum and user permissions. Let this be your rule of thumb: use the simple mode unless you have a good reason not to and you know what you’re doing.</p><p>The two simple mode options used the most frequently are "Registered" and "Public". To get a rough idea, in a "Public" forum, a visitor doesn’t have to be a registered user in order to post. In a "Registered" forum, only registered users can post. In both cases, only moderators and administrators can use more advanced features like specifying topic-type (sticky and announcement) or editing and deleting other people’s posts.</p><p>By default, all the forums that phpBB creates are public. A good (and common) practice is to change a forum’s permissions to "Registered" after you create it.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec08"/></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Time For Action—Setting Forum Permissions in Simple Mode"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl5sec13"/>Time For Action—Setting Forum Permissions in Simple Mode</h5></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Select<span class="strong"><strong> Permissions</strong></span> from the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Admin</strong></span> options in the left navigation:<a id="id81" class="indexterm"/><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_53.jpg" alt="Time For Action—Setting Forum Permissions in Simple Mode"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Select the<span class="strong"><strong> Funny pics</strong></span> forum and click on the<span class="strong"><strong> Look up Forum</strong></span> button.</li><li class="listitem">Select<span class="strong"><strong> Registered</strong></span> from the<span class="strong"><strong> Simple Mode</strong></span> options dropdown and click<span class="strong"><strong> Submit</strong></span>.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_54.jpg" alt="Time For Action—Setting Forum Permissions in Simple Mode"/></div></li></ol></div><div class="section" title="What Just Happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl6sec09"/>What Just Happened?</h6></div></div></div><p>Only registered users are now allowed to post in the "Funny pics" forum.

When a username (or a part of it) is disallowed, it cannot be used for registrations. So this feature is used before a username is taken, to prevent it from being taken. The form for disallowing usernames contains an interface for both adding and removing rules. The form is accessible through the<span class="strong"><strong> Disallow names</strong></span> link on the left.<a id="id98" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_68.jpg" alt="Disallowing Users"/></div><p>The following example shows how everything starting with Mod (as in Moderator) or Admin is disallowed to prevent imposters from using usernames suggesting that they are not just regular users, but have special community powers.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1132_03_69.jpg" alt="Disallowing Users"/></div></div></div></div>

This is true, because phpBB is a feature-rich bulletin-board system that provides a lot of flexibility to all user types—regular members, moderators, and administrators.

But this is not necessarily the case for most of the phpBB features as they are really intuitive and easy to use.</p><p>If you did the<span class="emphasis"><em> Time For Action</em></span> sections in this chapter, you should now have a pretty good idea how things are working around your new BB.
