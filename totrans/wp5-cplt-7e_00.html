<p><em>WordPress 5 Complete, Seventh Edition</em>, will take you through the complete process of building a fully-functional WordPress site from scratch. The journey goes all the way from teaching you how to install WordPress to the most advanced topics, such as creating your own themes, writing plugins, and even building non-blog websites. The best part is that you can do all of this without losing your shirt along the way. Moreover, once you get some practice, you will be able to launch new WordPress sites within minutes (that's not a metaphor, by the way; this is as true as it gets).</p>
<p>This book guides you along the way in a step-by-step manner, explaining everything there is to know about WordPress. We'll start by downloading and installing the core of WordPress, where you will learn how to choose the correct settings in order to guarantee a smooth experience for yourself and your visitors. After that, this book will teach you all about content management functionalities for your site, from posts and pages to categories and tags, all the way to media, menus, images, galleries, security, administration, user profiles, and more. Next, you will find out what plugins and themes are and how to use them effectively. Finally, you'll learn how to create your own themes and plugins to enhance the overall functionality of your website. Once you're done with <em>WordPress 5.0 Complete, Seventh Edition</em>, you'll have all the knowledge required to build a professional WordPress site from scratch.</p>

<p>In order to follow along with the examples in this book, you'll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer</li>
<li>A web browser</li>
<li>A plain text editor</li>
<li>FTP software</li>
</ul>
<p>You might consider a text editor that highlights code (such as Coda, TextMate, HTMLKit, and so on), but a simple plain text editor is all that's required. You may like to run a local copy of WordPress on your computer, in which case you may need a server such as Apache and MySQL installed (though WAMP, XAMPP, or MAMP can take care of all that for you). But even this is not necessary, as you could do the entire thing remotely.</p>
