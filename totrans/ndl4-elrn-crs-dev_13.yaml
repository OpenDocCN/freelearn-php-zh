- en: People learn from each other. Moodle is designed for groups who work asynchronously
    as well as synchronously, in a blend of "on-demand" and "live" web conferencing.
    Being able to effectively coordinate activities so that groups and cohorts work
    well together will enable you to ensure that there are ideal conditions for learning,
    especially the collaborative learning that is so vital to online learning. Facilitating
    collaborative learning and communication between students is a straightforward
    process with groups and cohorts. Keep in mind that virtually all levels of learning
    can benefit from collaboration, from the lowest level of Bloom's taxonomy, Remember,
    which can include collaboratively defining terms, to the highest levels, Evaluate
    and Create, which can involve students working together to appraise, critique,
    design, and develop.

    and cohorts in terms of how they relate to e-learners. We will then discuss when
    is the best time and way to organize students into groups and cohorts to achieve
    course learning objectives. By the end of the chapter, you will know how to create
    and manage groups and cohorts in Moodle.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both groups and cohorts are collections of students. However, there are several
    differences between them. We can sum up these differences in one sentence, that
    is, cohorts are site-wide or course category-wide groups. Cohorts enable administrators
    to enroll and unenroll students en masse, whereas groups enable teachers to manage
    students during a class. So, you can think of a cohort as a collection of students
    who are staying together in order to complete an entire course or sequence of
    courses together. Groups are smaller sets of students within the course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here''s another way to approach it: Think of a cohort as a group of students
    working together through the same academic curriculum; for example, a group of
    students all enrolled in the same degree program, and then they tend to have many
    courses together. For example, you may have a cohort (collection of students)
    who decide to pursue a Master''s of Liberal Studies together. They will all be
    enrolled in the required sources together.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A group is different than a cohort. A group is at the course level rather than
    the degree program. Think of a group as a subset of students enrolled in a course.
    Groups are used to manage various activities within a course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, members of a cohort may enter the degree program together, and
    they take the courses together in the same sequence. They have a lot in common
    because they have shared experiences, and over time, develop trust and long-term
    relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of cohorts is to make it possible for all the members of a cohort
    to be enrolled in a course, with just a few clicks. We can do this with cohort
    sync, which synchronizes cohort membership with course enrollment.
  prefs: []

    many operations with cohorts in bulk, affecting many students at once. In general,
    cohorts consist of students who matriculate at the same time, and then take all
    their classes together, culminating in graduating together. For example, as in
    the case in the previous section, 20 students enter a master's degree program
    at the same time. They take three courses per term, and they do so at the same
    time. The students would interact with each other in each course, albeit in different
    ways. Over time, they would develop trust and they would learn from each other.

    on the **X** button located next to the cohort sync field that you added to the
    course. However, this will not just remove users from the course, but it will

    enrollment methods page located next to the **Cohort sync** method that you added
    and click on **Settings**. On the **Settings** page, select **No** for **Active**.
    This will remove the role that the cohort was given. However, the members of the
    cohort will still be listed as course participants. So, as the members of the
    cohort do not have a role in the course, they can no longer access this course.

    course. For example, if your organization is using the same course for several
    different classes or groups, you can use the group feature to separate students
    so that each group can only see their peers on the course. For example, each month,
    you can create a new group for employees hired that month. Then, you can monitor
    and mentor them together.
