    requirements for the first phase.

    your Drupal site. You might be thinking that the preceding steps have created
    the Drupal site already, but this isn't the case. Since I'm going to do this now,
    this is a good time to mention that my most often-used analogy of a website is
    a house. What the preceding steps did was select the location, prep the lot, run
    the utilities for it, pour the foundation, and ensure that you have the materials
    necessary to build the house. *Now*, we're going to build it.

    does is create all of the geeky stuff that''s necessary for a website. After following
    a few steps, you will have a "vanilla" Drupal site, unadorned and not customized
    very much, but present and totally usable. Yes, just like a house that might be
    built in a cookie-cutter fashion, you have the ability to choose the paint, carpet,
    tiles, curtains, and appliances to make it unique and best reflect your vision,
    but those customizations are a topic outside of the scope of this book, although

- en: Like any software, Drupal occasionally needs updating. Also, because much of
    its functionality comes via add-on modules and contributed modules, they occasionally
    need updating too, and each can have different update schedules or be updated
    on a completely ad hoc basis. Therefore, Drupal will perform a check on a daily
    basis to see if any new releases are available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These checks are important, because the reason for the update can be to fix
    security-related issues. For that reason, it is normally good to keep the checkboxes
    checked. However, there are instances where there is no need to do so, for example,
    when there is an IT group that will be monitoring releases so that it isn't necessary
    for the site to do so, or in the case where the site is a local copy of a site
    used for development that will always match another site's versions. Again, the
    choices made here can be changed at any time, so if you're not certain, leave

    tab that contains the user settings such as username and password, and a Profile
    tab for managing profile information such as country, gender, and social links.

    can be much more prominent, such as in the case of e-commerce sites, where actions

    text, video, or some other form of media. Depending on the theme, there could
    be initial content above and/or below the main content, more than one piece of
    content within the main content area, and small areas of additional content, blocks,
    in other parts of the page, such as the Search and Tools menus in the preceding
