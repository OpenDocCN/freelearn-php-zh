    upload their individual projects, and see and assess each other's projects. They
    are ideal for courses that include higher-level orders of Bloom's taxonomy of
    educational objectives, beginning with Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. When a teacher
    requires each student to assess the work of several other students, the workshop
    becomes a powerful collaborative grading tool. It is also an ideal tool for peer
    review.

    The advantage of a workshop over using a wiki or a glossary as a collaborative
    project is that the workshops allow more options for bundling materials and activities,
    and there are also more options for assessment. Additionally, in the current learning
    environment that blends synchronous and asynchronous content, workshops can include
    "live" or synchronous presentations or panel discussions.

    online and also be done in conjunction with a face-to-face workshop with corporate
    or not-for-profit activities and training. They can be synchronous, asynchronous,
    or hybrid. Moodle 4.0's newly redesigned navigation helps students quickly find
    their way to the collaborative activities, and an updated dashboard can be configured
    so that students receive notice on the dashboard when a team member has posted.
    With one click, they're where they need to be. Furthermore, the workshop allows
    you to use a building block approach, where the concepts form the foundational
    underpinning, and group or individual projects, case studies, and presentations
    constitute the applications of the core concepts that are a part of the learning
    outcomes. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to design and configure
    a collaborative, peer-review workshop in Moodle.

- en: A workshop is a great way to boost the knowledge and skill level of a group
    very quickly. It helps people implement social constructivism by learning from
    each other, namely through peer review. Workshops in Moodle, such as those held
    in face-to-face settings, are great for getting students up to speed and functional
    with very little downtime. Usually, they focus on a single outcome, and they pare
    down the focus to ensure that the specific skill or knowledge set is achievable
    in a short period of time. For example, let's say that you have a course in entrepreneurship
    and the students are preparing to make group presentations on their start-up companies.
    A workshop gives them the perfect platform to develop and hone their presentations
    as a team and then present them to the overall class as a group.

    interact with peer reviews and share knowledge and information. Further, they
    involve creativity that is focused on the course learning objectives and outcomes.
    They are flexible and allow you to use both synchronous and asynchronous delivery.
    So, for example, if you have final presentations that are "live" and you'd also
    like to archive them, the Workshop gives you the perfect platform. Individuals
    work together to create their final products such as presentations. Then, they
    log into the institution's webinar platform (for example, Zoom, Teams, BigBlueButton,
    or even YouTube Live), and everyone can view it, comment, and save it for later
    in the archive.

    a workshop in which students assess each other's subject matter, outlines, and
    hypotheses for their term papers, or they can assess each other's photos for specific
    technical and artistic criteria before they are submitted to the instructor for
    grading purposes. Additionally, you can ask students to assess their synchronous

    might submit their work just before the submission deadline so that they cannot
    be assessed at all before the assessment deadline. Consider setting the submission
    deadline well before the assessment deadline. So, before opening up the assessment
    ability to students, examine the work submitted and ensure that it's close to
    what you expected or were trying to elicit from students. You might even want
    to use the time between the submission and assessment to refine your assessment
    criteria in response to the work submitted.

    with **Yes** or **No** questions. One of the questions is does this workshop meet
    the requirement? Alternatively, you can present the reviewer with a grading scale,
    such as **poor**, **fair**, **good**, and **excellent**. If you do use a **Yes**
    or **No** question, or a grading scale, you will assign a point value to each
    response. Consider informing the reviewer of the value of each response. For example,
    instead of just writing poor, fair, good, and excellent, consider writing poor

- en: Moodle offers several options for student-to-student and student-to-teacher
    interactions. When deciding which social activities to use, consider the level
    of structure and amount of student-to-student/student-to-teacher interaction that
    you want. For example, chats and wikis offer relatively unstructured environments
    with lots of opportunities for student-to-student interaction. They are good ways
    of relinquishing some control of the class to students. A forum offers more structure
    because entries are classified on the basis of topics. It can be moderated by
    the teacher, making it even more structured. A workshop offers the most structure,
    by virtue of the set assessment criteria that students must use when evaluating
    each other's work.

    which is to say that students can check their progress toward achieving learning
    outcomes at multiple points along the way. Then, at the end, they have a chance
    to turn in a summative assessment â€“ a project, presentation, portfolio, or something
    similar â€“ in a supportive, nurturing setting, because they have been building
    each building block in a nurturing, supportive, encouraging environment.
