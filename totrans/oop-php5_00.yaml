- en: Object-oriented programming is largely about the ability to hide what's not
    important to the user and to highlight what is. PHP 5 offers standardized means
    for specifying the variety of property scopes typically offered by full-featured
    OO languages.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. OOP vs. Procedural Programming") introduces
    object-oriented programming and how it fits for PHP. Some benefits of functional
    programming over procedural programming are highlighted.'

- en: In [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Kick-Starting OOP") you learn to create
    objects and define their properties and methods. Details of classes, properties,
    and methods follow, along with the scope of methods. This chapter shows you the
    benefits of using interfaces and a few other basic OOP features in PHP to kick
    start your journey through OOPing in PHP.

- en: Now that you have got your basics done for OOP in PHP, [Chapter 3](ch03.html
    "Chapter 3. More OOP") helps you to strengthen your base. It helps you to deal
    with more details and some advanced features. For example, you learn about class
    information functions, which allows you to investigate details of any class. This
    chapter takes you through some handy object-oriented information functions, exception
    handling, iterators, and storing objects using serialization.

- en: In [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Design Patterns") you learn some of the
    Design Patterns and how to implement them in PHP. These are an essential part
    of OOP and make your code more effective, more efficient, and easier to maintain.
    Sometimes we implement these design patterns in our code without knowing that
    these solutions are defined by design patterns. Proper usage of the correct pattern
    can make your code perform better; similarly using them improperly could make
    your code slower and less efficient.

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Reflection and Unit Testing") focuses on
    two very important features of object-oriented programming in PHP, reflection
    and unit testing. PHP5 replaces many old APIs with smarter new ones. One of these
    is the Reflection API, with which you can reverse or engineer any class or object
    to figure out its properties and methods. You can invoke those methods dynamically
    and more. Unit testing is an essential part of good, stable, and manageable application
    design. We focus on one very popular package, PHPUnit, which is a port of JUnit
    to PHP. If you follow the guidelines provided in this chapter you will be able
    to design your own unit tests successfully.'

    In [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Standard PHP Library") you will learn about
    the huge object repository named the Standard PHP Library or SPL.

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Database in an OOP Way"): In this chapter
    we discuss the improved MySQL API known as MySQLi and take a basic look at PHP
    Data Objects (PDO), adoDB, and PEAR::MDB2\. We take a look at the Active Record
    pattern in PHP using adoDB’s active record library and the Object-Relational Mapping
    (ORM) pattern using Propel. We focus on some specific topics that are interesting
    for PHP developers doing database access the OO way.'

- en: In [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Cooking XML with OOP"), you learn to process
    XML with PHP. You get to know about different APIs like the SimpleXML API to read
    XML and the DOMDocument object to parse and create XML documents.

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Building Better with MVC"): In Chapter 4
    you learned how design patterns can simplify your daily life in programming by
    providing you with a common approach for solving problems. One of the most used
    design patterns for application architecture is Model-View-Controller (MVC). In
    this chapter we discuss the basic structure of MVC frameworks and then introduce
    you to some of these popular frameworks. Frameworks play a very important role
    in Rapid Development of PHP applications. You will learn how to build a framework
    in this chapter, which will also help you to understand object loading, data abstraction
    layers, and the importance of separation and finally you get a closer look at
    how applications are done.'
