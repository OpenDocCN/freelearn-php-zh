<p>Up to this point, we looked at the development of WordPress sites using existing features as well as custom features. As developers, we can use the latest trending technologies, modern development techniques, and build sites with amazing interfaces. However, reasons such as exploitable code, poor performance, limitations in maintenance, and difficulty in migration can destroy sites with all the features and technologies. The non-functional aspects such as security, performance, code quality, and maintenance play a major role behind the scenes. So, it’s important to have the knowledge of using existing tools and services to address these areas in development.</p>
<p>We begin the chapter by understanding the importance of testing. We will be discussing different types of testing including unit testing, code quality and performance, and using the necessary tools. Then, we will be looking at the techniques of securing your WordPress site. Next, we look at the process of migrating sites from test server to live server using the necessary tools. Finally, we learn the necessary aspects of maintaining a site.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to testing</li>
<li>Unit and integration testing</li>
<li>Code quality and performance testing</li>
<li>Securing WordPress sites</li>
<li>Migrating WordPress sites</li>
<li>Maintaining WordPress sites</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By the end of this chapter, you should be able to build secure and maintainable sites, while optimizing the performance of features.</span></p>

<p>The process of testing the features of the site and code is critical for building successful sites or applications. This process allows us to detect any defects in the site before releasing to a live environment. There are several types of testing used in web development, where some of them play a very important role compared to others. We can test both functional and non-functional aspects of WordPress sites using these testing types. In this section, we are going to have a brief introduction to the most important functional and non-functional testing types. </p>

<p>Unit testing is used to test each small component independent from others, while integration testing is used to test the application in combination with all the modules. These two tests fall into the functional category, as we are checking the functionality and logic of our code. Compared to other popular frameworks, WordPress code is not the easiest to test. However, we can use <strong>PHPUnit</strong> for testing themes as well as plugins in WordPress. Installing and implementing test cases with PHPUnit is beyond the scope of this chapter. You can find a guide for working with PHPUnit at <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/automated-testing/">http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/automated-testing/</a>.</p>
<p>WordPress provides a set of test cases for testing major features. Many developers have a limited knowledge about existing test cases as it's not available inside the core. You can access a complete list of test cases at <a href="http://unit-tests.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/tests/">http://unit-tests.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/tests/</a>. Make sure that you gain knowledge about testing WordPress by going through the existing test cases. Then, you can write test cases for your own plugins and themes for unit testing purposes.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Code quality testing</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>Code quality testing falls into the non-functional category. This is one of the most important aspects of testing as the end user is not aware of the quality of code. Therefore, you can easily build sites by using plugins with low-quality code. However, it will be problematic in later stages when you work with different versions of WordPress, or use plugins that conflict with your code.</p>
<p>In WordPress sites, we can build our own plugins as well as use existing plugins. We can test our solutions by going through the code and fixing the code quality issues. However, it may not be practical when using existing plugins with thousands of lines of code. So, we need a solution that allows us to automatically test the code and provide a report with possible issues. Unfortunately, there are no up-to-date plugins in the directory that allow us to check the code of other plugins. So, the only way of automating the code testing process is by using a third-party service that checks the code and provides a report.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are not many services either for testing plugin code. There is a service called <strong>PluginTests</strong> at <a href="https://plugintests.com" target="_blank">https://plugintests.com</a> for testing the coding errors of WordPress plugins. However, it's limited to the plugins in the WordPress plugin directory. So, you won’t be able to test your custom plugins or premium plugins with this service. In development, we use many plugins from the WordPress plugin repository. Also, we can add our custom plugins to the repository as long as the source code is open. Therefore, we are going to look at the use of this service to quickly test plugins from the repository and find the errors, before deciding to use them. </p>

<p>Once you visit <a href="https://plugintests.com">https://plugintests.com</a>, you will get a search section to check any plugin from the repository. You will also see two other sections, listing popular plugins and the most recently tested plugins. If the expected plugin is within these lists, you just click and get a report for that plugin instantly. Let’s consider the following screenshot for most recently tested plugins:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-339 image-border" src="assets/caf5e357-3a08-4eb4-a216-c0bb1f5b8dc4.png" style="width:82.50em;height:41.83em;"/></p>
<p>We have the plugin name, time it was last tested, and the result in the list. You can see the availability of different results such as <strong><span class="packt_screen">ok</span></strong>, <span class="packt_screen"><strong>warning</strong></span> and <strong><span class="packt_screen">failure</span></strong>. The <span class="packt_screen"><strong>ok</strong></span> status means the plugin was tested successfully without issues. The statuses, <span class="packt_screen"><strong>warning</strong></span> and <span class="packt_screen"><strong>failure</strong></span>, mean there are issues with the plugin code. Usually, we will get minor JavaScript or PHP errors with the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>warning</strong></span> status. However, the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>failure</strong></span> status means that the service was unable to activate the plugin or there are fatal errors in the plugin code. So, we can have a brief understanding about the quality of the plugin just by looking at the status from the list.</p>
<p>When a plugin is not listed in the popular or most recent sections, you can search the plugin using the name or slug, and click the <span class="packt_screen">Search</span> button to load the results. Consider the following screen for the generated result for the popular WooCommerce plugin:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-340 image-border" src="assets/0559ba48-a50c-4db6-ba5d-e38979b8791e.png" style="width:92.08em;height:48.50em;"/></p>
<p><span>Those different sections mean</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span class="packt_screen"><strong>Errors</strong></span>: This section is filled with green ticks, meaning the plugin has no identifiable coding errors.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen"><strong>Environment</strong></span>: This section shows the WordPress, PHP, and MySQL versions used for the test along with the memory limit of the server.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen"><strong>Performance</strong></span>: This section gives a brief summary of the used resources and whether the plugin has any impact on the performance. As you can see, very limited memory is used for WooCommerce and the impact is insignificant, meaning that we can use the plugin without worrying too much about performance.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Plugin Info</span></strong>: This section shows the plugin information such as the last updated date, active installs, and URL from <a href="http://thewordpress.org" target="_blank">thewordpress.org</a> plugin page. These badges give you a straightforward idea about the compatibility with latest WordPress and PHP versions. WooCommerce is compatible with all the latest versions. You will see plugins with red color badges when there are incompatibilities, especially with PHP 7.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>After these sections, you will see a list-tested screen of the plugin with HTTP status, load time, memory usage, JavaScript, and PHP errors. These screens will help you identify the errors in individual features. The PHP error log is at the bottom of this report. You can check the error log and fix any coding issues that impact the site features, or decide not to use third-party plugins with a considerable amount of errors.</p>
<p>Apart from these features, we get useful info about a plugin, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roles and capabilities</strong>: It's important to know the roles and capabilities created by third-party plugins, as these permissions may not be compatible with some of the other third-party plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Widgets and custom post types</strong>: Also, you will get to know the custom post types and widgets registered through the plugin.</li>
<li><strong>Custom tables</strong>: This is also important as we need to be aware of how and where third-party plugins store the data. Also, knowing the use of custom tables is important in migrating sites with necessary backups.</li>
<li><strong>Resource usage</strong>: This section shows the resource usage of common WordPress admin and frontend screens when the plugin is active and inactive. So, you can decide which areas are mostly impacted by the use of the plugin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this is an excellent service for tracking coding errors in a plugin as well as understanding how each plugin affects your database and site features.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Performance testing</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In the old days, we had slow internet connections and users were willing to wait for results. Nowadays, we have superspeed internet connections and super busy schedules. So, users expect instant results when using a site or application. Even a delay of a few seconds can lead the user to an alternative site. So, the performance has become a very important factor in website development. Therefore, we need to consider every possible action that improves the performance of the application.</p>
<p>In general, improving performance requires us to reduce the time of loading or executing a site feature, while reducing the bandwidth used for the request. So, we want the website to deliver the results as fast as possible while using the minimum amount of data, especially for mobile-based users.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Let's find out the possible ways of improving performance of a WordPress site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caching application data</strong>: Caching allows us to deliver site pages to users without connecting to a database or executing complex time consuming logic. It’s mostly suitable for sites that don’t change often.</li>
<li><strong>Compressing and minimizing files</strong>: Generally, the size of data sent in a response impacts the loading or execution time. As the size gets lower, applications can provide the results faster. Compressing and minimizing files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images considerably reduces the size of the response. You can find many plugins for compressing and minimizing files of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Loading third-party files from fast CDNs</strong>: Generally, we use at least a few open source libraries when developing applications. jQuery is one of the most common among such libraries. We load jQuery within the WordPress files to keep the consistency and prevent duplication. However, loading such files through a <strong>Content Delivery Network</strong> (<strong>CDN</strong>) can be used to improve the loading time of such files.</li>
<li><strong>Removing low-quality plugins</strong>: We tend to use many plugins in web site development, and sometimes we can't check the code quality of each plugin we use due to time constraints. So, some of the plugins with low-quality code or a lack of proper implementation can create major performance issues in our site. Therefore, we need to check how each plugin affects the performance of the site and replace low-quality plugins with alternative ones.</li>
<li><strong>Limiting the number of database queries</strong>: We use many plugins in web development, and each plugin uses numerous database queries. On most occasions, these queries might be slowing down the application without our knowledge. Also, there can be many duplicate queries that can be converted into single queries with proper coding. So, it's important to check the database query usage of the application and limit it as much as possible.</li>
<li>O<strong>ptimizing existing queries</strong>: Sometimes, developers tend to use their own queries when those features are available through optimized WordPress functions. Also, developers may add unnecessary complexity to queries due to the lack of knowledge. So, it's important to identify the database queries that mostly impact the performance and optimize them.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the main criteria that affect the performance of a web site. There are many other such criteria for improving the performance of a web site. We use existing plugins/services to measure the performance in development and identify the possible improvements. There are a wide range of existing plugins in the WordPress plugins directory for measuring the performance. We are going to look at one of the plugins among them, as we already looked at a few plugins when setting up the development environment in <a href="205a9625-512c-4925-a3a8-bfe8a1784773.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="205a9625-512c-4925-a3a8-bfe8a1784773.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to WordPress Development</em>.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Even though this plugin has not been updated for a while, it’s still a popular solution for checking the performance of individual plugins. We can use it to measure the impact of each activated plugin in any given page. You can download and install the plugin from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/p3-profiler">https://wordpress.org/plugins/p3-profiler</a>. Once the plugin is activated, you can click on the <span class="packt_screen">P3 Plugin Profiler</span> menu item in the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> menu to load the scanning features. Then, you can click on the <span class="packt_screen">Start Scan</span> button and you will get a screen similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-341 image-border" src="assets/b59eae12-22bc-4e9a-a2b6-0c1249aac135.png" style="width:85.67em;height:48.67em;"/></p>
<p>We can use the <span class="packt_screen">Auto Scan</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Manual Scan</span> option to start scanning the site. The <span class="packt_screen">Auto Scan</span> option scans different content of your site randomly and generates the reports. On the other hand, <span class="packt_screen">Manual Scan</span> allows us to only visit the content based on our preference by clicking the links of the web site. Once results are generated, you will have a screen similar to the following with various details:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-413 image-border" src="assets/03b35a55-b871-4b34-87d1-d648019e99dc.png" style="width:97.00em;height:43.17em;"/></p>
<p>We can see the <span class="packt_screen">Plugin Load Time</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Plugin Impact</span>, and the <span class="packt_screen">MySQL Queries</span> per visit along with various charts in the available tabs. This allows us to directly see the plugins with the most performance impact. In this scenario, the WooCommerce plugin has the highest impact. Earlier, we used the PluginTest service and identified the resource usage of WooCommerce as insignificant. So, we can consider both results and come to the conclusion that this site is not using plugins that affect the performance, as WooCommerce is the plugin with highest impact. If some other plugin is having a higher impact, we can look at the code and use other tools to identify if there is an issue in the plugin that creates a major impact on performance. After such verification, we can keep the plugins or replace them with alternative plugins to reduce the plugin impact on our web site.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Securing WordPress sites</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The security of the site is one of the main concerns when developing sites or applications with WordPress. Open source code and the old coding techniques to keep the backward compatibility are two reasons for these security concerns. However, the major threat comes with the use of third-party plugins and themes, as there is no guarantee about the quality of them in many cases. So, it's essential to secure WordPress sites as much as possible to prevent attacks through plugins, themes, or known security concerns.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The WordPress codex provides a separate section called <strong>Hardening WordPress</strong> for defining the necessary security constraints. You can read this security guide at <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress">http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress</a>. Let’s find out the common reasons for WordPress exploits and basic precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Username of the admin</strong>: This is one of the most basic and primary reasons for exploits in WordPress sites. Many novice clients and developers keep <strong>admin</strong> as the username of the site administrator. So, the process of hacking becomes simpler as the attacker only has to find the password. So, it’s a must to change it to an advanced username including letters, numbers, and maybe some characters.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress core updates</strong>: Since it's open source and the community is very large, there is a high-percentage chance of someone finding a bug in each WordPress release or using it to exploit the existing WordPress sites. However, these issues are identified very quickly and an updated version is released immediately to prevent the issue. Many WordPress sites are maintained by non-technical administrators without the support of a developer. So, these administrators don't have the knowledge of updating WordPress or they are afraid of breaking the site by updates. The attackers can easily use the issues in old WordPress versions and exploit them.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin and theme updates</strong>: This is even more problematic than WordPress updates. Many of the WordPress sites are done by third-party one-time developers. So, the quality of the plugins or themes is questionable as they only focus on completing the features within the estimated cost. So, there are lot of plugins and themes with exploitable code and many of these are not even actively maintained. So, we can't expect a new version every time for fixing the bugs. Also, these sites are developed using dozens of WordPress plugins and hence manually updating versions of each plugin is not preferred by many administrators. So, the outdated versions of these plugins and themes can cause a major security threat. As a solution, you can enable automatic updates for WordPress.org-based plugins and themes by using <kbd>auto_update_plugin</kbd> and <kbd>auto_update_theme</kbd> filters, while returning <kbd>__return_true</kbd> as the value. However, there is a chance that updates of certain plugins or theme can cause conflicts in other plugins. Therefore, you need to keep a close eye on site functionality when using auto-updates.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration file location</strong>: By default, the configuration file is located in the root folder of your WordPress installation and contains the most important database login details. So, it's easier for the attacker as they know the file location. So, we need to protect this file by changing its location to a private directory in your WordPress site.</li>
<li><strong>User roles and permissions</strong>: There are five built-in user roles with different capabilities. In most sites, there are two or more people editing the content and managing the site. So, it's important to only give these users necessary features by using user roles and capabilities, while preventing access to important parts of the WordPress site.</li>
<li><strong>Login form security</strong>: The default WordPress login functionality is secure. However, attackers may use tools to guess the passwords and gain access to the site. Therefore, we need to implement additional security measures on WordPress login. We can protect the login by implementing features such as limit failed login attempts, using two-factor authentication, restricting to certain IPs, and so on. We can easily find existing plugins to implement these features.</li>
<li><strong>Backend file editing</strong>: In case an attacker somehow gets access to a site, he can use the theme or plugin editor to modify the files and add malicious code or completely destroy the site by deleting the data as well as files. So, we need to use <kbd>define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true )</kbd> in the config file to remove the file-editing capabilities for all users, or conditionally use it for certain users with custom code.</li>
<li><strong>Password complexity</strong>: This is one of the basic concerns in any site, not only in WordPress. Most administrators tend to use easy-to-remember simple passwords allowing attackers to guess them. So, the password needs to be long enough for the site to prevent attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only some of the basic precautions for securing WordPress sites. We need to use advanced security features, along with these features for sites with sensitive data and functionality. It's impossible to develop these advanced security features for use in development, unless your intention is building a security plugin. So, we have to use one or more top security plugins or services to secure the site. The following is a list of the most popular security plugins provided in the WordPress plugin directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iThemes Security</strong>: <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/">http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/</a></li>
<li><strong>BulletProof Security</strong>: <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bulletproof-security/">http://wordpress.org/plugins/bulletproof-security/</a></li>
<li><strong>All In One WP Security &amp; Firewall</strong> : <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We can choose one of these plugins based on the security features needed for a given site. It's possible to use more than one security plugin for providing different security features. However, there is a chance of them conflicting with each other and hence it's ideal to choose one quality plugin.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Migrating WordPress sites</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Generally, we develop sites on a staging server before migrating to the live server. The process of manually migrating sites is not practical in most scenarios as we have to manually back up the database, files, uploaded media, and upload to another server via FTP. So, we need to use a tool that allows us to automate the tasks of this process with a smooth migration. There are plugins that allow you to back up the database, files, and media separately, and then import them manually to the live server.</p>
<p>We are going to look at a plugin that offers all these features within the same plugin, making migration a super simple task. You can find a plugin called <span class="packt_screen">All-in-One WP Migration</span>. This plugin is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/</a>. Once activated, you can click on the <span class="packt_screen">Export</span> item from the <span class="packt_screen">All-In-One WP Migration</span> menu item on the left menu. You will get a screen similar to the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-343 image-border" src="assets/fe8ecc93-06a0-46f4-b064-382963952685.png" style="width:42.83em;height:22.92em;"/></p>
<p>The exporting feature starts with the database replace feature. We can use this feature to find and replace anything in the database. This is quite useful for changing the URLs of custom data to match the live site URL. Next, we can select the File option from the <span class="packt_screen">EXPORT TO</span> setting, and the plugin will generate the backup of your site to be downloaded as a single file with <kbd>wpress</kbd> as the extension. We can download the backup to our local machine.</p>
<p>Now, we have to go to the live site and install the same plugin. This time, we have to use the <span class="packt_screen">Import</span> section, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-344 image-border" src="assets/24135950-90b8-4c8b-bba1-ed2bd0a3372b.png" style="width:40.92em;height:16.67em;"/></p>
<p>We can click on the <span class="packt_screen">IMPORT FROM</span> button and add the exported <kbd>wpress</kbd> file generated in the previous section. Then, the plugin will migrate the entire site within minutes, making it a super-simple solution. Unlike other frameworks, we can completely migrate a WordPress site within a few minutes.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">The exported <kbd>wpress</kbd> files are stored in the <kbd>/wpcontent/ai1wm-backups</kbd> folder of your server. These files can be very large even for a basic websites. So, you have to make sure to remove the unnecessary backups to prevent the use of a large server space.</div>
<p>We can find all the exported and available backup files in the <span class="packt_screen">Backups</span> menu of the plugin. So, we can easily restore a site to its previous point using a single click. This is one of the best plugin available for site migration. You can also consider the following plugins as alternatives for site migration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duplicator</strong>: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/</a></li>
<li><strong>WP Staging—DB &amp; File Duplicator &amp; Migration</strong>: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-staging/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-staging/</a></li>
<li><strong>XCloner</strong>: Backup and Restore—<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/xcloner-backup-and-restore/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/xcloner-backup-and-restore/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these plugins offers different migration features including exports to Google Drive and other third-party services. So, you will have to try these plugins and choose the simplest plugin that migrates the sites, while being compatible with your hosting provider.</p>

<p>The process of maintaining sites is another problematic area in WordPress development. Many sites are built by non-technical clients without a developer, and hence they are not aware of the regular tasks in order to maintain the site. Once an issue is occurred, these clients looks for developers to fix them without having the necessary processes and resources. So, as a developer, it's important to keep the site maintainable and transfer the knowledge on the maintenance process to the client, in case you are no longer working on that site. In this section, we are going to look at the primary tasks for properly maintaining a WordPress site and how to implement these tasks:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Backup files and databases</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is one of the must-do tasks in maintenance, ruled out by many non-technical site owners. WordPress powers over 25 percent of the web and hence the number of attacks on WordPress sites are equally high. So, we need regular backups of files and databases to be used in such occasions. Unfortunately, many site owners don't have a proper backup process and some of them assume that it's done automatically by the hosting server.</p>
<p>There are hosting providers and features for automating the backup process from the server side. However, it's better to have our own backups using a manual process or using an existing plugin. There are many plugins that allow us to schedule backups of the sites, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>UpdraftPlus</kbd>: This is one of the most popular backup plugins with a wide range of features for file and database backup as well as restoring. You can find all the features at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/</a>.</li>
<li><kbd>BackUpWordPress</kbd>: Allows you to schedule backups for both files and database. You can find all the features at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/backupwordpress/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/backupwordpress/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We already discussed the use of the <strong>All-In-One WP Migration</strong> plugin for migrating WordPress sites. We can also use such plugins as the backup and restore mechanism for the same site as well. So, it's a must to use one of these backup plugins and schedule the backups of your site.</p>

<p><span>We already discussed the need for updating WordPress core, plugins and themes to improve the security of the site in the previous sections.</span> Also, it's an essential part of maintenance, as some of the plugins and themes may not be compatible with older or newer versions of WordPress. So, you need to keep track of the updates in plugins and themes, along with the possible bug fixes in each version. Otherwise, you will have to automate the update process using custom code, or use a plugin like <strong>Automatic Plugin Updates</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-plugin-updates/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-plugin-updates/</a>) for automating updates only for certain plugins.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Optimizing database tables </h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is another aspect in maintenance that is not considered by many site owners. We use many plugins in WordPress sites with different data needs. Many of these plugins work on existing database tables, and hence it's difficult to track which plugin is responsible for certain data in core tables. Some of these plugins provide a quality deactivation or delete process, removing all the plugin-related data from the database. However, many plugins don't have such a process and we can find many unused data in the database even after deleting the plugins. Also, WordPress core features such as revisions, transients, caching overloads core tables with unnecessary amount of data. </p>
<p>So, we need to optimize the database time to time by removing these unnecessary data. The first step is only choosing plugins that remove their data on uninstallation. Then, we can choose a database optimization plugin, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WP-Optimize</strong>: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/</a></li>
<li><strong>WP-Sweep</strong>: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sweep/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sweep/</a></li>
<li><strong>Advanced Database Cleaner</strong>: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-database-cleaner/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-database-cleaner/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The common features of these plugins include the ability to delete revisions, auto-drafts, comments with certain statuses, and duplicated and orphaned metadata. We have to use one of such plugins to keep the database clean by removing unused data.</p>

                </header>

<p>We use many third-party libraries and resources from external sites when developing sites. So, these resources are loaded through external URLs. Sometimes, we may notice the unavailability of these files due to server unavailability or other errors. So, unavailability of some files may create conflicts in our site features. Also, we might link to no-longer-available content, leading to 404 errors. So, we need to track these issues and resolve them in order to keep the consistency of our site features.</p>
<p>We can use a plugin such as <strong>Broken Link Checker</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/</a>) to identify the broken posts, pages, or screens on our sites. Also, if you are using an analytics tool such as <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, we can check the requests to the 404 page and them track backward to find the links causing the issue.</p>
<p>We discussed performance-measuring plugins in previous sections. These plugins will show you a list of loaded files with the loading time, along with a list of files with loading errors from external sources. The most common issue is unavailability of CSS or JavaScript files from external sources. So, we can use such plugins to identify these files and update the URLs, or download and include these files locally within plugins.</p>

<p>Once debug mode is switched off in a live environment, we won't see any errors generated in the site. Many third-party low-quality plugins generate minor and major errors. So, we need to have a error log to regularly check the site for errors as well as identify the cause, when something breaks on your site. The hosting providers also provide error logging features in servers. However, we should use our own error logs by using the core WordPress error log features, or using a plugin such as <strong>Error Log Monitor</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/error-log-monitor/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/error-log-monitor/</a>) to keep track of the existing errors and fix them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>These are some of the primary tasks for maintaining a site. You can find more minor tasks and plugins for maintaining sites. As a developer, you should have a proper maintenance routine based on the functionality of each site.</p>

<p>In site development, we mainly focus on the functional aspects, as the client or end users will be involved directly in functionality. However, we will have to give equal importance to non-functional aspects. These non-functional aspects may decide the success or failure of a site as these factors are the keys for using or leaving the site. </p>
<p>We began the chapter by understanding the importance of testing. We looked at several types of functional and non-functional testing with the help of tools such as <strong>P3 Plugin Profiler</strong>, and services such as <strong>PluginTest</strong>. Then, we discussed the need for implementing key security precautions while identifying the plugins for handling advanced security measures. Next, we looked at the importance of automating the site migration process using the <strong>All-in-One WP Migration </strong>plugin. Finally, we looked at the important tasks for properly maintaining a WordPress site, while exploring the existing plugin-based solutions for maintenance.</p>
<p>We began this book by introducing you to the core WordPress features, concepts, and data usage. Then, we developed various features by using core functionality, extending core functionality, and building custom solutions. Finally, we completed the book by looking at the important non-functional requirements for web sites. <span>It's up to you now!</span></p>
