			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor375"/>Chapter 5</em>: Adding Resources to Your Moodle Course</h1>
			<p>Resources<a id="_idIndexMarker315"/> are the instructional materials that students use to achieve the learning and performative outcomes of a course. In a world where face-to-face instruction is often severely curtailed, and synchronous web conferencing and asynchronous deliveries are often blended, readings, videos, maps, podcasts, and other kinds of documents are the key building blocks that are used in each course. Moodle gives you a way to organize the materials so that they flow in accordance with your course plan, and you can make the resources available in a way that makes sense, given your learning goals. The flexibility that Moodle offers has become increasingly important in today's environment of blended synchronous and asynchronous learning. This chapter will teach you how to add those resources to a course, as well as how to make the best use of them. We will also discuss how to select, sequence, and deploy the resources so that they contribute to student success in achieving outcomes.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tying resources to course outcomes</li>
				<li>Adding different kinds of resources</li>
				<li>Adding URLs and embedded resources</li>
				<li>Adding pages</li>
				<li>Adding files for your students to download</li>
				<li>Adding media – video and audio</li>
				<li>Organizing the resources</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to identify the appropriate resources to add and achieve the course learning objectives, manage the resources, and then use them effectively.<a id="_idTextAnchor376"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor377"/>Tying resources to course outcomes</h1>
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> is the time<a id="_idIndexMarker317"/> to review your course plan, which will involve the course map<a id="_idIndexMarker318"/> and <strong class="bold">Course Design Document</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDD</strong>), which we discussed in <a href="B17288_03_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Categories and Courses</em>. As you may recall, the course map and CDD constitute a storyboard and learning outcomes. In Moodle, "resources" refer to the content that you'll include in the course. The interactive assessments and engagers are referred to as "activities," but we'll cover that in <a href="B17288_06_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor467"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding Assignments, Lessons, Feedback, and Choice</em>. For now, let's consider the best way to develop the course materials that will best align with the course goals. </p>
			<p>It is great to have lots of resources, especially those that align with all kinds of learners in the course. However, unless they are organized well, and they tie clearly to course outcomes, you'll generate frustration instead of confidence.</p>
			<p>Planning and organization are the keys to success in selecting, sequencing, and deploying your resources. Always tie them first to the learning outcomes, and then ensure that they are grouped in ascending order of complexity so that you're building a strong foundation and then scaffolding it at higher leve<a id="_idTextAnchor378"/>ls.</p>
			<p>So, the first step should always be to list the course outcomes and then create an outline of your course in which you start to identify the resources you'll need:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>List course outcomes.</li>
				<li>Review your course outline.</li>
				<li>Identify the resources you'll ne<a id="_idTextAnchor379"/>ed.</li>
				<li>Map the resources to your outcomes and identify any gaps that may exist.</li>
				<li>Develop your storyboard or CDD to place the materials in sequence.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following is a planning grid or framework that you can use to keep track of your resources and make sure there are no gaps when it comes to your learning objectives and the Bloom's taxonomy levels. Keep in mind that the following table is simply a framework and that the entries I've incorporated are simply to help you get started. To make it <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>easier to conceptualize, I'm using the example of a course <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>called <em class="italic">English 1102: Writing about Literature</em>: </p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Course map (planning grid)</p>
			<p>It is also a <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>good idea to tie <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>course resources to delivery methods (synchronous, asynchronous, blended pedagogy, and so on) so that you can optimize the way that they are deployed. For example, a 90-minute video might be appropriate for <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>asynchronous or <em class="italic">on-demand</em> courses, but not for a synchronous course, where <em class="italic">live</em> interaction <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>is where most of the learning takes place. </p>
			<p>Now that you've learned how to connect your resources to learning outcomes, you'll learn how to add the resources to your course so that you can use them effectivel<a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>y. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Adding different kinds of resources</h1>
			<p>The following table lists the<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> types of resources that are available in Moodle. Resources can be added from the <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> drop-down menu. Using this menu, you can add the following resources:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer095" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – Different kinds of resources </p>
			<p>Having a selection of <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>resources that comprise your instructional materials and connect to the learning objectives will help you have a successful course, as well as helping your students have a very positive user experience. Now that you know what is possible, you will learn how to link to them and embed them for maximum functionality.  <a id="_idTextAnchor382"/><a id="_idTextAnchor383"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor384"/>Adding URLs and embedded resources</h1>
			<p>On your<a id="_idIndexMarker327"/> Moodle site, you can show content from anywhere on the web using a link. You<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> add this link to your course's home page. When the student clicks on the link, the linked item is displayed.</p>
			<p>When using content from outside sites, you need to consider the legality and reliability of using the link. Is it legal to display the material within a window on your Moodle si<a id="_idTextAnchor385"/>te? Will the material still be there when your course is running? When in doubt, link to the resource. Take a moment to review the<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> Creative Commons license, as well as resources that are available for educational use under FAIR guidelines: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">https://creativecommons.org/license<span id="_idTextAnchor386"/>s/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor387"/>Display options – Embed, Open, and In pop-up</h2>
			<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>can choose how the page is displayed; there are three options:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer099" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.3_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Configuring the appearance of the URL or embedded resource  &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Configuring the appearance of the URL or embedded resource  </p>
			<p>You can <strong class="bold">embed</strong> the<a id="_idIndexMarker331"/> linked page into a Moodle page. Your students will see the <strong class="bold">Navigation</strong> bar; any blocks that you have added to the course and navigation links will be shown across the top of the page, just like when they view any other page in Moodle. The center of the page will be occupied by the linked p<a id="_idTextAnchor388"/>age.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Open</strong> will <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>take the student off your site and open the linked page in the window that was occupied by Moodle.</p>
			<p>Finally, <strong class="bold">In pop-up</strong> will<a id="_idIndexMarker333"/> launch a new window on top of the Moodle page, containing the linked page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer100" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.4_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Configuring the resource to create a pop-up window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Configuring the resource to create a pop-up window</p>
			<p>We will look at these options in detail in the following sect<a id="_idTextAnchor389"/>ions.</p>
			<h3>Embed</h3>
			<p>To embed a <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>page or a player, you will need to copy and paste the <strong class="bold">embed</strong> HTML code when you select a resource to include. You will see the options, and when the window for embed opens, you can simply paste the code into the<a id="_idTextAnchor390"/><a id="_idTextAnchor391"/> box. </p>
			<h3>Open</h3>
			<p>When the <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>user clicks on the link to the resource on the course home page, Moodle displays the page, along with the description of the link and a link to the outside page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer101" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.5_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – An example of how an embedded page is displayed within Moodle&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – An example of how an embedded page is displayed within Moodle</p>
			<p>Clicking on the link activates the player, which is now embedded in your page. The learner can now view the resource while staying in Moodle (in this case, a YouTube video). However, sometimes, the video might be too tiny for the detail, and the learner would like to watch it in full screen. In that case, they would click on the <em class="italic">enlarge</em> square, which will take the learner outside Moodle and directly to the YouTube video: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer102" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.6_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Clicking the bracketed square in the embedded YouTube&#13;&#10; view will expand the view to full page &#13;&#10;"/>

			<h3>In pop-up</h3>
			<p>When the<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> learner clicks on the link to the resource on the course home page, Moodle displays the page with the description of the link and a link to the external page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer103" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.7_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – The link to the resource that's been set to pop-up mode&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – The link to the resource that's been set to pop-up mode</p>
			<p>Clicking on the link opens a pop-up window containing the external page. It is displayed on top of the window that's displaying your Moodle site:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer104" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.8_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – In pop-up mode&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – In pop-up mode</p>
			<p>Clicking a<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> link when you're using <strong class="bold">In pop-up</strong> mode will open the page of an external website on top of the window.</p>
			<p>The following section contains instructions for creating a link on your course home page, and for using these options.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor395"/>Adding links</h1>
			<p>To add a<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> link to a resource on the web, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the topic or the week where you want to add the resource, click <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong>. If you're not sure where you want to add the link, just make your best guess. You can move it around the course later.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> dialog box will be displayed. Click on the radio button next to <strong class="bold">URL</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter a <strong class="bold">Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Description</strong> for the link. To learn more about how the name and description affect the learner experience, please refer to <a href="B17288_04_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Resources, Activities, and Conditional Access</em>.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">External URL</strong> field, enter the web address for this link.</li>
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong>, from the <strong class="bold">Display</strong> drop-down menu, select the method that you want Moodle to use when displaying the linked page – that is, <strong class="bold">Embed</strong>, <strong class="bold">Open</strong>, or <strong class="bold">In pop-up</strong>. Choosing <strong class="bold">Automatic</strong> will make Moodle choose the best method for displaying the linked page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For more information about these display options, check out the <em class="italic">Display options – Embed, Open, and In pop-up</em> section, explained previously.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Display URL description</strong> checkbox will affect the display of the page, but only if <strong class="bold">Embed</strong> is chosen as the display method. If selected, the <strong class="bold">Description</strong> details will be displayed below the embedded page.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Under <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong>, you can set the size of the pop-up window. If you don't select <strong class="bold">In pop-up</strong> as the display method, these fields will have no effect.</li>
				<li>Under <strong class="bold">Parameters</strong>, you can add parameters to the link. In a web link, a parameter will add information about the course or a student to the link. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Common Module Settings</strong>, the <strong class="bold">ID number</strong> field, and the <strong class="bold">Restrict Availability</strong> settings were covered in <a href="B17288_04_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Resources, Activities, and Conditional Access</em>.</li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>on one of the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> buttons at the bottom of the page to save your work.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In addition to URLs and embedded pages from outside websites, it is possible to add additional pages to the course. In the next section, you will learn how to add pages and then add content t<a id="_idTextAnchor396"/><a id="_idTextAnchor397"/>o them.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>Adding pages</h1>
			<p>Moodle <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>enables you to compose a web page and add it to your course. The page that you add will be created and stored on your Moodle site. Be very strategic when adding Moodle pages. If you are not careful, you'll create confusion. Here are the best ways to use pages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Add content that ties to the course outline</strong>: You may have short narratives or an<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> entire chapter. Creating pages rather than a file allows you to also include links and for the navigation to flow very smoothly so that your students stay within Moodle at all times.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Add portal pages with introductions, plus links, files, and books</strong>: You may wish to have a long introduction to your content for a specific unit or chapter of your course. You can create a page, add your introduction (including graphics and text), and then have an organized set of links, files, folders, and even books.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you add a <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>page to your course, Moodle displays a text editor. Using this editor, you can put almost anything onto the Moodle web page that a normal web page can contain.</p>
			<p>A link to the page that you create will appear on the course's home page.</p>
			<p>If you can use a basic word processor, you can use most of the web page editor's features. A full discussion of the editor's features is beyond the scope of this section. Inste<a id="_idTextAnchor399"/>ad, we will examine a few of the key features that are available in Moodle's editor. Please note that you can include math and chemical symbols, as well<a id="_idTextAnchor400"/> as HTML. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/>Adding a page to your course</h2>
			<p>To add a <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>page to your <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>course, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the topic or the week where you want to add the resource, click on <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong>. If you're not sure where you want to add the link, just make your best guess. You can move it around the course later.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> dialog box will be displayed. Click on the radio button next to <strong class="bold">Page</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Moodle will display the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page for this resource.</li>
				<li>Enter a <strong class="bold">Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Description</strong> for the page. The name will become the link to this page and will appear in the section that you added it to on the course's home page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you select the <strong class="bold">Display description on course page</strong> checkbox, the description will appear on the course's home page. You can use this feature to tell the student what to expect when they view the page and tell them its purpose:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer105" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>On the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page, you can compose the web page. Scroll down to the <strong class="bold">Content</strong> section; you <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>will see a text editor for composing the page and for editing the page's <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>content: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer106" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.10_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10 – The text editor in the Settings page, which allows you to compose the new page  &#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – The text editor in the Settings page, which allows you to compose th<a id="_idTextAnchor402"/><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/>e new page  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor404"/>Adding images</h2>
			<p>When you select an<a id="_idIndexMarker347"/> image to add to a Moodle page, you can choose images from those that you have already uploaded in Moodle, or you can upload a new image. Uploading huge image files can take up space and slow down page load times. It is a good idea to optimize your images. </p>
			<p>A less obvious feature is the ability to link to a picture that is hosted on another website. If you are using pictures hosted on anothe<a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>r website, you can add the link, but be aware that link addresses change often. Also, be sure to<a id="_idTextAnchor406"/> give credit.</p>
			<h3>Inserting an image file</h3>
			<p>This procedure is for <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>inserting an image file that you have archived on your computer or an external hard drive or flash drive. In this example, the user has a diagram that they want to insert into the page, as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer107" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.11_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11 – Adding details when inserting an image file&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11 – Adding details when inserting <a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>an image file</p>
			<p>To insert an <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>image file, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">On the Moodle page, click to place the insertion point where you want the image to appear.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Choose File</strong> icon, as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer108" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.12_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12 – Inserting an image in a news forum by clicking on the Insert Image icon&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12 – Inserting an image in a news forum by clicking on the Insert Image icon</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">The <strong class="bold">Insert/Edit image</strong> window will appear. In this window, click on the <strong class="bold">Find or upload an image</strong> button.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">File picker</strong> window will be displayed. In this window, click on the <strong class="bold">Upload a file</strong> link.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Choose File</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Locate the file on your computer and select it.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Open</strong> or <strong class="bold">OK</strong> button.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Save as...</strong> field, give the file a user-friendly name. You can use special characters and spaces.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Author</strong> field is automatically filled in with your name. If someone else is the owner of this file, enter their name here.</li>
				<li>From the drop-down list, choose a <strong class="bold">license</strong> for this file. This allows you to inform other Moodle teachers who want to use this file about what they can legally do with the file.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Upload this file</strong> button. The file will be uploaded to your Moodle system and you will be returned to the <strong class="bold">Insert/edit <a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>image</strong> window.</li>
				<li>It is good practice to fill in the <strong class="bold">Image description</strong> field. This is used by visually impaired users who can't see the image and by search engines to index the image.</li>
				<li>If needed, fill out the fields under <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong>. You may want to resize the picture since Moodle will, by default, display the picture at its original size.</li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>on the <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> button. The picture will be inserted <a id="_idTextAnchor409"/><a id="_idTextAnchor410"/><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>into the page.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Pasting text</h2>
			<p>Many times, we<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> prefer to write text in our favorite word processor instead of writing it in Moodle, or we find text that we can legally copy and paste into Moodle. Moodle's text editor allows y<a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>ou to do this. </p>
			<p>However, ensure that you keep in mind that Microsoft Word's various versions can do strange things to formatting. You may wish to strip out all the macros that create very clean text. You can use Notepad, or even <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>Notepad++ (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">https://notepad-plus-plus.org</a>). Once you've stripped out Microsoft's macros, you'll have to go back in and format (bold, underline, and so on), and you'll have to make your URLs live.</p>
			<p>To paste<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> text into a page, you can just use the keyboard shortcut. Try using <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">V</em> for Windows PCs and <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">V</em> for Mac. If you use this method, the format o<a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>f the text will be preserved.</p>
			<h3>Stripping out the formatting when pasting text from Microsoft Word</h3>
			<p>When you paste <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>text from a Microsoft Word document onto a web page, it usually includes a lot of non-standard HTML code. The same thing occurs with other word processing programs, such as Google Docs. This code doesn't work well in all browsers and it makes it more difficult to edit the HTML code on your page. Many advanced web page editors can clean up Word HTML code. Keep in mind that the editor cleans up any code that could be dangerous and create vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers. So, don't be surprised if your text looks different than you had expected. </p>
			<p>Moodle's web page editor can also clean up Word HTML code. You can also use Moodle's editor function to include math and chemical symbols. </p>
			<p>When pasting text that was <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>copied from Word, use the <strong class="bold">Clear Formatting</strong> icon. This will strip out most of Word's non-standard HTML code:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer109" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13 – The Clear Formatting icon </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>Composing in an HTML editor and uploading to Moodle</h2>
			<p>There<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> are a few disadvantages of relying on Moodle<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> to strip out Microsoft Word macros. First, the spacing is rarely exactly right, and to correct it takes quite a bit of time. However, it may not be possible to be online all that time, so you may wish to work offline and not in Moodle. So, you may want to compose your web page in an HTML editor such as <strong class="bold">Adobe</strong> <strong class="bold">Dreamweaver</strong> or even the free web-based HTML editor <strong class="bold">SeaMonkey</strong>. This is especially true if you want to take advantage of these editors' ability to insert advanced features into your web page. How, then, do you get that page into your Moodle course? You <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>can copy and paste the HTML code from your web page editor into the Moodle<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> page editing window. To do this, you must do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the HTML <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>view in your web page editor. For example, in <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>Dreamweaver, you would select <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Code</strong>, and on the front page, you would select <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Reveal Codes</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer111" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.15_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 5.15 – The HTML icon&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15 – The HTML icon</p>
			<p>To reveal the HTML code in Moodle and edit it, click the <strong class="bold">HTML</strong> icon.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Select the HTML code in your web page between the two body tags – that is, drag from just after the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag near the top, to just before the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;/body&gt;</strong> tag at the end. Copy the code with <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Copy</strong> or by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">C<a id="_idTextAnchor423"/></em>. Then, do the following:<ol><li>Switch over to Moodle and create the new web page.</li><li>Show the HTML code by clicking on the icon.</li><li>Paste the code by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">V.</em></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p>A second <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>method is to publish your web page someplace <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>ou<a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>tside of Moodle and create a link to it from your course. Linking to your website is a good idea because when you paste text into the editor, Moodle will remove anything that it<a id="_idTextAnchor425"/> identifies as "dangerous."</p>
			<h3>Learning more about HTML</h3>
			<p>To learn more about<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> HTML code, you can start with the organization responsible for defining the standards. The <em class="italic">World Wide Web Consortium</em> maintains the complete standards for HTML online at <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards">https://www.w3.org/standards</a>. It maintains a basic <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>tutorial at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp</a>. Everything that's covered in this basic guide can be done using the editor in Moodle in its normal mode. The advanced HTML guide at <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Advanced.html">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Advanced.html</a> covers some features that you would need to go into the HTML view to add, such as defining click<a id="_idTextAnchor426"/>able regions within images and using rollovers.</p>
			<p>In addition to adding pages that contain content, it is possible to add files for students to download. Please note that Moodle often has a limited amount of space for hosting content on Moodle (either on-premises or in the cloud). So, you may consider having students download files from a cloud-based file-sharing site such as OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive. </p>
			<p>In the next section, you will learn how to add files for students to download, as well as how to make sure that they can both download and open them<a id="_idTextAnchor427"/> so that they can use them.  </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>Adding files for your students to download</h1>
			<p>You can add<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> files to a course so that your students can download them onto their personal computers. Some examples of files you may want students<a id="_idTextAnchor429"/> to have are forms to fill out, readings to complete before class, and <a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>word processing files to edit.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>When a student selects a file from the course</h2>
			<p>When a <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>student selects a file from your course, the student's computer will attempt to open that file. Moodle will only pass the file to the student's computer. For example, if it's a PDF file, your student's computer will probably try to use Adobe Reader or the Preview app to open the file. If it's a word processing file, your student's computer will attempt to use Word or some other word processor to open it. If your student's computer doesn't have a program that can open that type of file, it will probably prompt the student to save the file. In the case of a graphic or a sound file, their computer will use whatever resident application's most convenient. I<a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>t is usually not the ideal one.</p>
			<p>You can override this behavior with a setting called <strong class="bold">Force download</strong>. When you choose that setting, your student's computer will not try to open the file. Instead, it will download the file and prompt the student to save it.</p>
			<p>If you want the student to use the file immediately upon accessing the file, just go with the default behavior. If you want the student to save the file for future use, select the <strong class="bold">Force download</strong> setting.</p>
			<p>You will see this setting in the next section, when we look at <a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>the instructions <a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>for adding files to your <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>course.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>File repositories</h2>
			<p>Every file that you upload into a <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>Moodle course is stored in a Moodle repository. Before we add files to our course, we need to understand how r<a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>epositories work and how to choo<a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>se the right kind for our course.</p>
			<h3>Types of repositories</h3>
			<p>A repository is a <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>storage area that Moodle can access. The repository doesn't need to be on your server – it just needs to be accessible to your Moodle system. For more information about how to increase functionality and customize Moodle, you may wish to read a book on Moodle administration Moodle 3 Administration, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/moodle-3-administration-third-edition/9781783289714">https://www.packtpub.com/product/moodle-3-administration-third-edition/9781783289714</a></p>
			<p>Repositories <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>need to be enabled by the site administrator, under <strong class="bold">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Plugins | Repository</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage repositories</strong>. Here are some examples of file repositories:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.16 – When to use different types of repositories</p>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>have reviewed the different types of repositories, let's discuss when and how to use them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>Using file-sharing services to collaborate</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>you use a file repository such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, you are storing your files outside of Moodle. This is a great way to collaborate. It is a good idea to use file-sharing servic<a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>es as well when collaborations continue beyond the time and scope of the course<a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor441"/>Using repositories to overcome Moodle's limit on file sizes</h2>
			<p>There is a <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>limit to the size of a file that can be uploaded into your Moodle system. This limit changes for different Moodle sites. If you are using MoodleCloud, then there are even more compelling reasons to use repositories. Here, you can create a master document with links to the content that lives outside your course.</p>
			<p>Three settings limit the size of a file that can be uploaded into Moodle. Two of those settings are on your web server. The administrator for your web server will need to change them. If you are using a shared hosting service, you may not be able to change these settings. The third setting is in Moodle; it can be changed by the system administrator.</p>
			<p>The size limit for uploaded files is the smallest of these three settings<a id="_idTextAnchor442"/>. </p>
			<p>In Moodle, under <strong class="bold">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Courses</strong> | <strong class="bold">Course default settings</strong>, look for the <strong class="bold">Maximum upload size</strong> setting. The maximum size available under that setting is taken from the <strong class="source-inline">php.ini</strong> file. You can set a lower limit than this but not a higher limit. For this, please check with your site administrator or check out Packt's book, <em class="italic">Moodle Administration</em>, at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/moodle-4-administration-fourth-edition/9781801816724">https://www.packtpub.com/product/moodle-4-administration-fourth-edition/9781801816724</a>.</p>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>upload a file into Moodle, it will be placed in a file repository. By default, it will appear in the <strong class="bold">Server Files</strong> repository. If the <strong class="bold">Recent Files</strong> repository is enabled, the file may also appear there. If the file is too large, Moodle will not allow it to upload.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor443"/>Functionality Booster</h2>
			<p>In today's environment of hybrid synchronous and asynchronous delivery, Moodle can be a lifesaver. If you are using<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> BigBlueButton or another web-conferencing platform, you can make resources immediately available by posting them in <strong class="bold">Resources</strong> within Moodle, and also by including a link in the chat room of Zoom. </p>
			<p>You may also record a Zoom meeting. Later, you can download the version of the <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong> video file that you prefer. You can also download the transcript. Once you've downloaded it, you can upload the <strong class="source-inline">.mp4</strong> video file to the video hosting service you prefer, which could be YouTube, Vimeo, or another service. </p>
			<p>The transcript of the audio can be a vital tool, particularly for those who may be hearing-impaired or whose first language may not be English (or the language of the webinar). Having an audio transcript available helps you adhere to the principles of Universal Design. Keep in mind that you may need to do a bit of copy-editing.</p>
			<p>Once you've added descriptions and transcripts of media, you can add the media itself. You will learn how to do so in the next session. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor444"/>Adding media – video and audio</h1>
			<p>If you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>add video or audio to your course, you have three choices: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, you can add it as a resource or file. If you do that, when the student selects the file, one of two things will happen: either the media file will be downloaded to the student's computer and played by the software on their computer, or Moodle will try to play that file with its built-in media player. If multimedia plugins are enabled under <strong class="bold">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong>, Moodle will try to play the file in its built-in media player. If multimedia plugins are not enabled, the file will be played using whatever media player is on the student's computer. HTML5 was designed to make it easy to play media of all kinds from all kinds of devices (phones, tablets, and laptops) and all browsers. Moodle accommodates HTML5. </li>
				<li>Second, you can embed the media on a Moodle page (please refer to the <em class="italic">Adding pages</em> section). This will cause the media to be played on the web page.</li>
				<li>Third, you can copy and embed code into the HTML of your page in Moodle. You will see a small screenshot containing the URL and a <strong class="bold">Play</strong> icon. The player looks like it is in Moodle, bu<a id="_idTextAnchor445"/>t it's being played from the host (YouTube, Vimeo, and so on). You can also add entire packages containing multimedia by uploading a SCORM <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>package or HTML5 via the H5P functiona<a id="_idTextAnchor446"/>lity. </li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor447"/>Adding video or audio to a page</h2>
			<p>This procedure will add video, audio, or an applet to a Moodle page. You must own the file that you are adding – that is, the file is on your computer and not on another website. If the file that you want to appear is on another website, see you will need to embed the media rather than uploading it.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">On the Moodle page, click to place the insertion point where you want the media to appear.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Insert Moodle media</strong> icon:</li>

			</ol>
			<p>If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>inserting a podcast, you may not be able to insert only the <strong class="source-inline">.mp3</strong> file. In the case of a podcast, you'll need to embed the HTML code. The following is an example of SoundCloud: </p>

			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>media player and the description will both appear in the window once you save the descrip<a id="_idTextAnchor449"/>tion.</p>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>embed a video<a id="_idIndexMarker391"/> on a page, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Find the media that you want to link to. For example, you may find a video on several different sites.

				<li>Check the license for the material to ensure that you have the right to use it as you intend.</li>
				<li>Somewhere on the page, you will see a button or link that will give you the HTML code to embed the video, either by copying and pasting the URL or the entire embed code block:</li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor451"/>Functionality Booster</h2>
			<p>In a hybrid course that has synchronous webcasting (Zoom, for example), you may find that people are not as engaged as you may wish. Some people like to combat audience apathy by including periodic <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>polls or opinion questions in <strong class="bold">Chat</strong>. This is a good idea, and you can save the responses as a historical reference and an engager. </p>
			<p>If you want to be able to save the polls and opinion questions, you can build them as a choice question in Moodle and then simply link to them in the <strong class="bold">Chat</strong> section of Zoom. I suggest that students keep two windows open: one with the Zoom meeting and the other with Moodle, where they can participate in <strong class="bold">Choice</strong>. By incorporating Choice into Moodle, webinar attendees who watch the recording can still participate in the poll or opinion question. </p>
			<p>Once you have added items such as media to your course, you can add labels to the items that you've added to make it easier for students to identify them. To make it even easier to navigate and to improve the user experience, let's learn how to move material around on the cours<a id="_idTextAnchor452"/>e page. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor453"/>Using labels to further organize your course</h1>
			<p>The main tools<a id="_idIndexMarker395"/> for organizing a course in Moodle are sections and labels. In this <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>section, we'll learn how to use them and how to move material around on the co<a id="_idTextAnchor454"/><a id="_idTextAnchor455"/><a id="_idTextAnchor456"/>urse page.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor457"/>Naming your topics</h2>
			<p>In a course that uses the<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> topics format, your topics are automatically named and numbered, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer122" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.25 – Adding a label to help further indicate what the topic is about</p>
			<p>You can move the label so that it appears immediately under the topic:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.26 – Moving the label's position</p>
			<p>You may wish to <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>add graphics for engagement to the label. You can do so by opening the label and modifying it. In this case, I clicked on the <strong class="bold">Insert media</strong> icon, then clicked on <strong class="bold">Repositories</strong>. I selected <strong class="bold">Wikimedia</strong> from the <strong class="bold">File picker</strong> window and then entered <strong class="source-inline">geothermal energy New Zealand</strong> as my search term. Success! I have quite a few to choose from:  </p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.27 – Wikimedia label and images</p>
			<p>You can add <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>graphics that illustrate your topic by adding a label and then selecting from Wikimedia or other sources.  </p>
			<p>The result is very attractive and engaging. The label looks like it is a part of the topic, and it gives you a chance to add items that will engage the learners: </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor461"/>Rearranging/moving items on the course home page</h2>
			<p>As you build your course, you will be adding resources and activities to the course page. Moodle allows you to easily reposition these items. It's so easy to reposition them that I recommend that you don't even worry about getting them in the right place as you are creating them. Just forge ahead and create – you can rearrange later.</p>
			<p>Rearranging<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> items on the <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>course page can be done like so:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Log in to your course as a teacher or a site administrator.</li>
				<li>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> top-right corner of the page, if <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>you see a button called <strong class="bold">Turn editing on</strong>, click on it. If it's called <strong class="bold">Turn editing off</strong>, you do not need to click on<a id="_idTextAnchor462"/> this button.</li>
				<li>Next to the <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>item that you want to move, place your <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>mouse pointer over the <strong class="bold">Crosshairs</strong> icon</li>
				<li>Drag the item to where you want it on the course p<a id="_idTextAnchor463"/>age and drop it.</li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor464"/>"Instant course" with videos in the public domain – a good idea? </h2>
			<p>In the last few years, the<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> number of educational videos has proliferated, and they are often of very high quality. For example, the <strong class="bold">United States Department of Agriculture</strong> (<strong class="bold">USDA</strong>) has made a number of their food inspection training videos available on their website: <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/inspection/inspection-training-videos/regulatory-education-video-seminars">https://www.fsis.usda.gov/inspection/inspection-training-videos/regulatory-education-video-seminars</a>. If you are a school that offers vocational training, you're probably thrilled that such high-quality resources exist and that they are free to use for educational purposes. </p>
			<p>It may be tempting to simply upload the videos into separate modules. You say to yourself, "Yippee! Instant course!" and you tell yourself it's all good. After all, the videos contain instructions. But is such an approach legitimate? Is it a full course? The short answer is "no." Even if the video has learning objectives within it, you still need to frame the instructional video within an instructional strategy. </p>
			<p>So, if you are lucky enough to find resources in the public domain that perfectly align with your goals, you'll still need to create a course map and a CDD that include the elements we discussed earlier<a id="_idTextAnchor465"/> in this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor466"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at the resources that are available in Moodle. They are non-interactive course materials (books, pages, URLs, files, and labels) that form the core of most online courses.</p>
			<p>Adding static material first gives you a chance to think about how the material will be discussed and used. Later, you can add more dynamic resources, and make connections to the course objectives and the assessments. The intent of Moodle 4.0 is to enhance your learning experience, as well as giving you more opportunities to deploy resources in ways that trigger thoughts and connections to the learning objectives and course goals, and help you demonstrate mastery. </p>
			<p>What we emphasized in this chapter was the importance of selecting, sequencing, and deploying resources so that they always advance the goals of the course and help students meet their learning objectives. We also discussed how to incorporate current practices that include blended asynchronous/synchronous delivery, particularly when there is a desire to include webinars, which are then recorded (with transcripts). </p>
			<p>Organizing your resources for students so that they know which chapter or unit they correspond to can help instill a sense of confidence and an "I can do it!" attitude in them. We also provided functionality tips for strategies to boost student engagement for blended synchronous and asynchronous courses. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to add some interactive material. Instead of just reading and viewing material that you post, the student will produce work and interact with their teacher and peers online.</p>
