- en: 'Various terms are used to pigeon-hole Drupal: platform, framework, environment,
    and so on. At its core, Drupal is a content management system (CMS). Like the
    other terms, the meaning of CMS can be somewhat abstract and ambiguous, so here
    is what I feel the terms mean within the context of this book:'

- en: Drupal offers a breadth and depth of capabilities, with a strong baseline functionality
    that's greatly expandable via a high degree of customization. There is a cost
    associated with this, and with any product that offers broad personalization,
    and that is a learning curve that is not insignificant. Think about your first
    interactions with a car's display console, a smart watch, or even the New York
    subway system, and you will likely recall an initial paralysis when deciding the
    first thing to do; for some, there is nothing intuitive in the experience.
