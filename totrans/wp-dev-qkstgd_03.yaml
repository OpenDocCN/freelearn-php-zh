- en: The design of a website plays a vital role in attracting visitors. WordPress
    themes are used as a standard technique for designing the frontend of a site.
    The availability of thousands of existing themes makes the design process simple
    as well as flexible. This means that developers have the ability to build custom
    designs in a rapid process. Building advanced designs via the modification of
    existing theme files is a common problem in development, and is often realized
    in the late stages of site development. Developers should have the ability to
    turn default WordPress themes into amazing frontends and also build custom themes,
    while being compatible with the WordPress core and theme upgrades.

    you should use the theme files hierarchy to build flexible designs using custom
    templates. You will also learn to extend themes by using child themes, actions,
    filters, and page templates. From there, you will learn the process of understanding
    and modifying the templates of various themes in existing sites. Understanding
    how different theme components fit into your design and modifying these components
    in existing sites without breaking the theme is the highlight of this chapter.

    features, to act as the presentation layer of the website. In simple terms, the
    presentation layer should contain the HTML needed to generate the layout and all
    the data passed by the models. WordPress is built to create content management
    systems, and hence it doesn't focus on separating the presentation layer from
    its business logic.

    with each theme using its own folder. A theme is identified by the predefined
    set of comments used in the `style.css` file. If this file is not available or
    the comment is broken, WordPress will not list it as a theme, even though the
    theme files have been placed in the `wp-content/themes` directory.

    theme. Therefore, we override the necessary parent theme styles using the `WPQuickStart
    style.css` file.

    customizing theme features. We will mainly use these hooks to extend the functions

    in a process. A filter is a function that is used to modify the existing data
    or features in a process. Even though actions are intended to do something before
    or after an event, they are used frequently to add content to templates. More
    about actions and filters will be covered in upcoming chapters.

    these actions and filters is to use the directory or project search feature in

    should use the term `apply_filters` to search for filters in the theme, and `do_action`
    to find out the actions defined in it. You may find a small number of these hooks
    in free themes and hundreds in premium themes. These hooks consist of built-in
    WordPress hooks as well as theme-specific hooks. As a developer, you need to have

    Many themes, including premium themes, use `archive.php` to generate the author

    name and hence this template will only be loaded for a single user. Since this
    is a dynamic template, you won''t find it in any of the themes. This is something
    a developer should create to cater for the specific requirements of a site. Creating
    a theme template for each author is not practical, unless you have a limited and
    fixed number of authors. Therefore, you will rarely find requirements to use this
    kind of template in development.'

    If you have already worked with WordPress posts, you should be familiar with **Categories**
    and **Post Tags** in the post creation screen. These are two built-in taxonomies
    that are assigned to normal posts by default. On the other hand, custom taxonomies
    are the grouping types we create for certain post types based on the requirements
    in different sites. We can assign one or more taxonomy values to posts or custom
    post type items. Once posts are assigned, we get an archive page with a list of
    posts for the specific taxonomy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Categories, tags, and custom taxonomies work in the exact same way, with similar
    template hierarchies. The `archive.php` file is used to load these three types
    by default, by using taxonomy title and description. In the author archive, we
    needed a way to display complete author details with an attractive design. In
    this case, we don't need to focus on such details, as taxonomies rarely use additional
    details. Instead, we might need to change the design and display of posts in taxonomy
    archive pages. We can use the `category.php`, `tag.php`, and `taxonomy.php` templates
    in such scenarios, similar to the way we used `author.php`. These templates need
    to be added to child themes based on your requirements as most of the themes only
    use the `archive.php` file for all three types.
  prefs: []

    August 2018, July 2018, and so on. Once you click on one of these links, it will
    load the posts that were created in that month. The URL of the site may look similar
    to `http://www.example.com/2018/07`. We can check yearly archives by removing
    07 from the URL and daily archives by adding the date after 07\. One again, `archive.php`

    blog post, custom post types can contain a considerable amount of data and design
    requirements. Therefore, it may not be feasible to use `archive.php` to load the
    list of custom posts in most scenarios.

    Even though this is a dynamic template type, we can create and add this template
    to child themes, since custom post types in a site are fixed in most scenarios.
    In this case, WordPress will only load archive.php when it can''t find a template
    with `archive-$post_type.php`. Nowadays, many premium themes comes with built-in

    timeless content. Usually, we call pages static, even though they're not as same
    as the pages of pure HTML websites we had in the old days. However, the content
    doesn't change often and hence is considered static compared to posts. In a basic
    site, you will find WordPress pages for contact, about, services, and so on. This
    path is divided into two types called **Custom Template** and **Default Template**.
    Let's start with **Default Template** so that we can understand the need for custom
    templates.

    each and every page we need. We also have to manually modify the templates when
    we remove or change the existing pages. Custom page templates don't have these
    limitations and we can use one template to design multiple pages. We can also

    for handling the template for blog posts. In the archives section, we understood
    the difference between the normal post list and the custom post type list with
    regard to advanced features. Similarly, we need even more specific templates for
    custom post types, and hence using `single.php` for all three types may not possible.
    In such scenarios, we can make use of the `single-post.php` template, which was
    designed exactly for normal blog posts. The content of the `single-post.php` file
    will be similar to `single.php`, and we can add more elements and styles to change
    the design.
