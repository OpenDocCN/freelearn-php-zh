- en: The design of a website plays a vital role in attracting visitors. WordPress
    themes are used as a standard technique for designing the frontend of a site.
    The availability of thousands of existing themes makes the design process simple
    as well as flexible. This means that developers have the ability to build custom
    designs in a rapid process. Building advanced designs via the modification of
    existing theme files is a common problem in development, and is often realized
    in the late stages of site development. Developers should have the ability to
    turn default WordPress themes into amazing frontends and also build custom themes,
    while being compatible with the WordPress core and theme upgrades.

  zh: 网站的设计在吸引访客方面起着至关重要的作用。WordPress主题被用作设计网站前端的标准技术。数千种现有主题的可用性使得设计过程既简单又灵活。这意味着开发者能够以快速的过程构建自定义设计。通过修改现有主题文件构建高级设计是开发中的常见问题，通常在网站开发的后期阶段实现。开发者应该能够将默认的WordPress主题转变为惊人的前端，并构建自定义主题，同时与WordPress核心和主题升级兼容。
- en: In this chapter, you will gain knowledge of what should be in a theme and how
    you should use the theme files hierarchy to build flexible designs using custom
    templates. You will also learn to extend themes by using child themes, actions,
    filters, and page templates. From there, you will learn the process of understanding
    and modifying the templates of various themes in existing sites. Understanding
    how different theme components fit into your design and modifying these components
    in existing sites without breaking the theme is the highlight of this chapter.

- en: A WordPress theme is a set of files, created using a predefined structure and
    features, to act as the presentation layer of the website. In simple terms, the
    presentation layer should contain the HTML needed to generate the layout and all
    the data passed by the models. WordPress is built to create content management
    systems, and hence it doesn't focus on separating the presentation layer from
    its business logic.

  zh: WordPress主题是一组文件，使用预定义的结构和功能创建，作为网站的展示层。简单来说，展示层应包含生成布局和所有由模型传递的数据所需的HTML。WordPress旨在创建内容管理系统，因此它不关注将展示层与其业务逻辑分离。

    developer, you need to have knowledge of both designing layouts and applying logic

- en: The themes in your WordPress site are located in the `wp-content/themes` directory,
    with each theme using its own folder. A theme is identified by the predefined
    set of comments used in the `style.css` file. If this file is not available or
    the comment is broken, WordPress will not list it as a theme, even though the
    theme files have been placed in the `wp-content/themes` directory.

- en: '**Customizing post and page designs**: This is the most common task developers
    face in the beginning of their developer role. There are millions of websites
    that have been created with WordPress, and a high percentage of them are created
    by non-technical site owners who are using existing themes and plugins. So, when
    there is a need for a change in theme, owners have no option other than to look

    requirement in small to medium sites that are built with WordPress. On most occasions,
    developers will have to work in existing sites with existing themes that have
    been chosen by the owner. So, you should have the skills to look at any given
    post/page in the site, and then identify the templates and theme components used

    and find **Top Menu**. Next, we can change the menu or menu items for that location.
    If you need to customize the code for the menu location, you can search for the
    `wp_nav_menu` function in the theme with **menu_id** as **top-menu**. The use
    of these menu names in elements differs from one theme to another. However, you
    should be able to find hints about the menu's location by inspecting the elements.

    Menu**。接下来，我们可以更改该位置的菜单或菜单项。如果您需要自定义菜单位置的代码，您可以在主题中搜索以**menu_id**为**top-menu**的`wp_nav_menu`函数。这些菜单名称在元素中的使用因主题而异。然而，您应该能够通过检查元素找到有关菜单位置的提示。

    has its own directory inside the `wp-content/themes` directory, and relates to
    the parent theme through a few lines of comments. The child theme doesn't get
    updated with the parent theme and hence we can use it for custom development.

    If you have already worked with WordPress posts, you should be familiar with **Categories**
    and **Post Tags** in the post creation screen. These are two built-in taxonomies
    that are assigned to normal posts by default. On the other hand, custom taxonomies
    are the grouping types we create for certain post types based on the requirements
    in different sites. We can assign one or more taxonomy values to posts or custom
    post type items. Once posts are assigned, we get an archive page with a list of
    posts for the specific taxonomy.

    template hierarchies. The `archive.php` file is used to load these three types
    by default, by using taxonomy title and description. In the author archive, we
    needed a way to display complete author details with an attractive design. In
    this case, we don't need to focus on such details, as taxonomies rarely use additional
    details. Instead, we might need to change the design and display of posts in taxonomy
    archive pages. We can use the `category.php`, `tag.php`, and `taxonomy.php` templates
    in such scenarios, similar to the way we used `author.php`. These templates need
    to be added to child themes based on your requirements as most of the themes only
    use the `archive.php` file for all three types.

    August 2018, July 2018, and so on. Once you click on one of these links, it will
    load the posts that were created in that month. The URL of the site may look similar
    to `http://www.example.com/2018/07`. We can check yearly archives by removing
    07 from the URL and daily archives by adding the date after 07\. One again, `archive.php`

    on other parts of your site should use the same UI component library. If you use
    different UI elements in other parts of the site, users may feel confused. Similarly,
    every other element in the design needs to be consistent. However, this doesn't
    mean that we can't change the design in different parts of the site. More on this
    will be discussed in the following sections.

    with various pieces of content such as promotions, advertisements, social sharing
    options, and so on. So, there are scenarios where we need different headers for
