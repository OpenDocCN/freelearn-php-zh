<p>In 2014, after two years of reading about and working with Domain-Driven Design, Carlos and Christian, friends and workmates, traveled to Berlin to participate in Vaughn Vernon's <a href="https://idddworkshop.com">Implementing Domain-Driven Design Workshop</a>. The training was fantastic, and all the concepts that were swirling around in their minds prior to the trip suddenly became very real. However, they were the only two PHP developers in a room full of Java and .NET developers.</p>
<p>Around the same time, <a href="https://tek.phparch.com">php[tek]</a>, an annual PHP conference, opened its call for papers, and Carlos sent one about Hexagonal Architecture. His talk was rejected, but Eli White — of <a href="http://musketeers.me">musketeers.me</a> and <a href="https://www.phparch.com">php[architect]</a> fame — got in touch with him a month later wondering if he was interested in writing an article about Hexagonal Architecture for the magazine php[architect]. So in June 2014, <em>Hexagonal Architecture with PHP</em> was published. That article, which you'll find in the <a href="b7e5ae5b-cf31-496b-986e-a6b60e087304.xhtml">Appendix</a>, was the origin of this book.</p>
<p>In late 2014, Carlos and Christian talked about extending the article and sharing all their knowledge of and experience in applying Domain-Driven Design in production. They were very excited about the idea behind the book: helping the PHP community delve into Domain-Driven Design from a practical approach. At that time, concepts such as Rich Domain Models and framework-agnostic applications weren't so common in the PHP community. So in December 2014, the first commit to the GitHub book repository was pushed.</p>
<p>Around the same time, in a parallel universe, Keyvan co-founded Funddy, a crowdfunding platform for the masses built on top of the concepts and building blocks of Domain-Driven Design. Domain-Driven Design proved itself effective in the exploratory process and modeling of building an early-stage startup like Funddy. It also helped handle the complexity of the company, with its constantly changing environment and requirements. And after connecting with Carlos and Christian and discussing the book, Keyvan proudly signed on as the third writer.</p>
<p>Together, we've written the book we wanted to have when we started with Domain-Driven Design. It's full of examples, production-ready code, shortcuts, and our recommendations based on our experiences of what worked and what didn't for our respective teams. We arrived at Domain-Driven Design via its building blocks — Tactical Patterns — which is why this book is mainly about them. Reading it will help you learn them, write them, and implement them. You'll also discover how to integrate Bounded Contexts using synchronous and asynchronous approaches, which will open your world to strategic design — though the latter is a road you'll have to discover on your own.</p>
<p>This book is heavily inspired by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577">Implementing Domain-Driven Design</a> by Vaughn Vernon (aka <em>the Red Book</em>), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a> by Eric Evans (aka <em>the Blue Book</em>). You should buy both books. You should read them carefully. You should love them.</p>

            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>If you're a PHP Developer, Architect, or Tech Lead, we highly recommend this book. It will help you become a better professional. It will give you a new overview of and approach to the applications you're developing. If you're a Junior profile, getting into Value Objects, Entities, Repositories, and Domain Events is important in order to model any Domain you'll face in the future. For an average profile, understanding the benefits of Hexagonal Architecture and the boundaries between your framework and your Application is key for writing code that's easier to maintain in the real world (framework migrations, testing, etc.). More advanced readers will have fun both exploring how to use Domain Events in order to integrate Applications and delving deeper into Aggregate design.</p>
<p>Although Domain-Driven Design is not about technology, you still need it to make HTTP requests to access your Domain. Throughout the book, we recommend using specific PHP frameworks and libraries, such as Symfony, Silex, and Doctrine. For some examples, we also use specific technologies, such as MySQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, and Elasticsearch. However, most important are the behind-the-scenes concepts — concepts that are applicable regardless of the technology used to implement them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the book is loaded with tons of details and examples, such as how to properly design and implement all the building blocks of Domain-Driven Design — including Value Objects, Entities, Services, Domain Events, Aggregates, Factories, Repositories, and Application Services — with PHP. It explains what the role of the main PHP libraries and frameworks used in Domain-Driven Design are. The book also teaches how to apply Hexagonal Architecture within your application, regardless of whether you use an open source framework or your own one. Finally, it shows how to integrate Bounded Contexts using REST frameworks and messaging mechanisms. If you're interested in any of these subjects, this book is for you.</p>

<p>In 2016, Carlos and Christian went to the first official Domain-Driven Design conference, <a href="http://dddeurope.com/">DDD Europe</a>. They were really happy to see some PHP open source leaders, such as Marco Pivetta (Doctrine) and Sebastian Bergmann (PHPUnit), attending the conference.</p>
<p>Domain-Driven Design arrived in the PHP community two years prior to that conference. However, there's still a lack of documentation and real code examples. Why? We think not many people have worked with this kind of approach in production yet — even people in other more established communities such as Java. Maybe this is because their project complexity is low, or maybe it's because they don't know how to do it. Whatever the reason, this book is written for the community. One of our goals is to teach you how you can write an application that solves your Domain issues without being coupled to specific frameworks or technologies.</p>

<p>Bounded Contexts can be implemented in different ways and using different approaches. However, two styles are getting more popular, and they are Hexagonal Architecture and CQRS + ES. In this chapter, we'll see these two main Architectural Styles, understand what their main strengths are, and discover when to use them.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Value Objects are the basic pieces for rich modeling. We'll learn what their properties are and what makes them so important. We'll figure out how to persist them using Doctrine and custom ORMs. We'll show how to properly validate and unit test them. And finally, we'll see what a test case of testing immutability looks like.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Entities are Domain-Driven Design building blocks that are uniquely identified and mutable. We'll see how to create and validate them and how to properly map them using a custom ORM and Doctrine. We'll also assess whether or not annotations are the best mapping approach for Entities and look at the different strategies for generating an Identity.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Domain Events are a great Inversion of Control (IoC) mechanism. In Domain-Driven Design, they're important for communicating different Bounded Contexts asynchronously, improving your Application performance using eventual consistency, and decoupling your Application from its Infrastructure.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>With so many tactical building blocks, it's a bit difficult to know where to place them in code, especially if you're dealing with a framework like Symfony. We'll review how PHP namespaces can be used for implementing Modules. We'll also discover different hierarchies of folders for organizing Domain Model code, Application Code, and Infrastructure Code.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Aggregates are probably the most difficult part of tactical Domain-Driven Design. We'll look at the key concepts when dealing with them and discover how to design them. We'll also propose a practical scenario where two Aggregates become one when adding a business rule, and we'll demonstrate how the rest of the objects must be refactored.</p>
