			<p>Welcome to Moodle! In this first part of the book, you'll learn about Moodle's philosophy of learning and the way to find and use the unique, open-source Moodle learning management system. </p>
			<p>What makes this book unique is that it is much more than just a technical guide for using Moodle. It's a guide that builds in reliable instructional design principles at every step of the way so that you are designing not only courses but an entire learning plan that will help your students succeed and achieve learning objectives and institutional goals. </p>
			<p>In addition, you'll be given great guidance as you create a course design plan, and you'll be encouraged to use a course map to make sure that the kinds of resources, assessments, and interactions are aligned with your course goals and that your students will actually learn what they need to learn. You'll also benefit from great suggestions and guidance for encouraging interaction and engagement to help boost course completions and student success. </p>
