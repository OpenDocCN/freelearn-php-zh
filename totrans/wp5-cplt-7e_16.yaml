    chapter is a continuation of that topic, so let''s do two things. First, let''s
    go through some of the more trendy uses of WordPress and focus on a step-by-step
    process for reaching a great final result. Then, let''s discuss some of the custom
    content elements you can create in WordPress, such as custom post types, custom
    taxonomies, and the process of customizing the admin display slightly. We will

- en: E-commerce stores, in general, are websites where anyone can browse through
    a number of products and then use a shopping cart to make a purchase. Also, most
    e-commerce stores offer some kind of online payment integration, which allows
    every visitor to make and complete a purchase quickly. Additionally, sometimes
    there's even a backend inventory management system (an online warehouse of sorts)
    to make backend business management easier and integrated with the website.

- en: The best thing about e-commerce is that you can actually launch a fully functional
    online store with WordPress. This, in my opinion, is simply incredible! As a former
    website developer, I actually remember how expensive and time-consuming it was
    to build such a store from the ground up. And now, you can just install WordPress,
    get a proper theme, download a specialized e-commerce plugin, and you're good
    to go! This is a prime example of how technology helps you to run your business
    the modern way.

- en: Okay, enough with the intro. Let's focus on the actual process of building a
    quality e-commerce store. First off, the thing with e-commerce stores on WordPress
    is that they are extremely plugin-driven, so to speak. What I mean is that if
    you want to launch such a website, you will need to get one main e-commerce plugin
    that's going to be responsible for the complete set of operations available in
    your store. In short, this plugin will run your store. For that reason, choosing
    the right plugin is extremely important, which is something I'm sure you understand.

  zh: 好的，介绍就到这里。让我们专注于构建一个优质电子商务商店的实际过程。首先，WordPress上的电子商务商店的特点是它们极其依赖于插件，换句话说。我的意思是，如果你想启动这样一个网站，你需要获取一个主要的电子商务插件，这个插件将负责你在商店中可用的所有操作集合。简而言之，这个插件将运行你的商店。因此，选择正确的插件非常重要，我相信你明白这一点。

    what's actually quite surprising is that the most popular plugin of them all is

- en: WooCommerce (available either at [https://woocommerce.com/](https://woocommerce.com/)
    or [https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/))
    is beautifully designed and offers a truly exceptional range of features, which
    I will get into in a minute. The main reason why I like the WooCommerce plugin
    so much is because it can be integrated with any theme. And I really do mean *any*.
    However, for a real-life business website (not just a test website, like the one
    we're going to build in a minute), I still think that you should use an optimized
    e-commerce theme. Again, feel free to visit one of the popular theme stores to
    get something of top quality. I listed a number of them in [Chapter 7](ffd72a00-558a-4dfc-a5c2-83f6051196a7.xhtml),

    you may stumble upon what're called custom post types. Or you may even decide
    to create them yourself for the purpose of your individual projects. But let's
    take it from the top. The most commonly known types of content in WordPress are
    *posts* and *pages*. However, if we feel that the situation/project calls for
    it, we can create any number of new post types by taking advantage of the custom
    post type functionality and its wide versatility.

    type named `book` to present their publications in an attractive way, instead
    of just using standard posts. This is exactly what we're about to do in this section

    to have a custom post type in your theme, you can add some code to your theme's
    `functions.php` file. This is what we'll be doing. However, keep in mind that
    you can also attach the custom post type to a plugin or a widget if you don't
    want it to be tied to a particular theme.

    To be more exact, every template file controlling the archive for any new custom
    post type has to be named `archive-POST_TYPE.php`. The easiest way to create such
    file is by making a copy of the standard `archive.php` file or the `index.php`
    file, and renaming it to `archive-book.php`. Then, we can take it from there and
    modify the file to fit our requirements. So, what I'm going to do here is use
    my `index.php` as the template and do some tuning up around it.
