            <article>
                
<p>Now that you've determined what you'd like your students to be able to do after they have completed your course, and as you're done with the initial planning stages, you are now ready to start building the framework for your course.</p>
<p>Selecting the initial course settings and format allows you to organize your course. In this chapter, we'll learn how to build a structure that accommodates your course content, activities, resources, information, and assessments. In <a href="26182cb1-48bc-4e6d-846a-4a11089be075.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Planning Your Course</em></span>, you learned how to plan your course with learning outcomes in mind. Now, as we start adding content, thinking about how students will demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and attitudes will help us effectively organize the course. We'll start by building a framework.</p>
<p>As we start to develop the framework, we will include some of the most commonly used elements in Moodle courses. Keep in mind, however, that we're not including everything. Instead, we're aiming to build a basic framework in a step-by-step manner so that, by the end of this chapter, you will be in a position to add the content and activities in your course in a clear, coherent way, all the while keeping the overall learning outcomes in mind.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics in terms of organizing your course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course goals</li>
<li>Course settings</li>
<li>Course format</li>
<li>Customizing the appearance of your course</li>
</ul>
<p>A great way to start thinking about the best structure for your course is by reflecting upon what you want your students to be able to do by the end of the course and the course material that you'll need to include for them to demonstrate that they've achieved their learning outcomes. Keep in mind that it's best to keep your list simple and focused on the essential items rather than on all the potential supplemental or optional material, that might enrich your list but isn't vital.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>At this point, you may feel a bit overwhelmed as you review your list and wonder, "What am I going to do with all this material?"</p>
<p>Moodle makes your decisions fun and intuitive because it comes with a number of options that will help you both organize and design your course at the same time.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a course framework that we can use as a template with which to create functionally consistent courses for use in college degree programs, certificate courses, corporate training, and so on, and what we are doing in this chapter represents a very important step towards achieving it. So, if we keep the big picture in mind and consider the needs and ultimate objectives of the stakeholders, from learning organization administrators to curriculum developers, instructional designers, professors/teachers, and students, we will be in a better position to make good decisions as we select the settings and options in Moodle. This will help us make sure that our course is well designed and functional, resulting in a positive learning experience.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's start by keeping the big picture in mind, not just in terms of learning outcomes and course content, but also in terms of your students and teachers. After all, while you build your course, you may also be developing a demo course or a template that could be used across an entire curriculum and with a broad array of users.</p>
<p>Since both teachers and students have a very diverse range of skills, abilities, and attitudes, it is important to keep their needs in mind as we begin to organize the course and follow the principles of UDL.</p>
<p>Then, as you start creating the structure, consider what your course's home page will look like when students and teachers log in. Keep in mind that many students will use more than one device to access your course and the screens will vary in terms of size and what they can display.</p>
<p>The following are a few tips for making sure your course structure works well in today's environment—laptops, tablets, smartphones, and desktops, all with varying display sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the most important links and information are on the course's home page and that they are visible on the screen of any device</li>
<li>Test the appearance of your course website on the devices your students and instructors will be using</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the navigation throughout your course is simple and consistent and that you use concise, descriptive text for links, and not just <span class="packt_screen">C</span><span class="packt_screen">lick here</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Click on this link</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Having a clear, clean course home page will help your students develop confidence as they navigate the course. They will know where to find the materials they need and when and how to access them. In addition, make sure that the links on the course's home page take them directly to the materials they need. This way, your students don't have to click multiple times on multiple drill-downs, and they will not feel lost and confused.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>You can learn more about UDL by working through a tutorial developed by the <em>National Center for Assessing the General Curriculum</em> at <a href="http://sde.ok.gov/sde/sites/ok.gov.sde/files/LowIncidence.pdf">http://sde.ok.gov/sde/sites/ok.gov.sde/files/LowIncidence.pdf</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>As you consider how the organization of your course will help your students perform and do what they need to do, you can also begin to envision how they will interact with the learning materials and assessments.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The best course is one that is aligned around the course learning goals, which are called learning objectives. As you select your instructional materials, activities, and assessments, make sure that they connect to your learning objectives, and that they are sequenced in a way that allows your learners to build on the knowledge and skills they gain. </p>
<p>As you plan your content, please be sure to keep culture in mind as well. Culture is something that draws on the practices, values, beliefs, and traditions of a specific group, and although we like to think of culture as something that occurs on a large scale, it also occurs within a small group. </p>
<p>We'll be creating a culture in the course itself, and it's important to align the beliefs, values, and customs with the learning objectives as well in order to encourage a sense of inclusion and belonging. A culture of inclusion is particularly important in the case of the Moodle constructionist philosophy, which has interaction at its core, and where people learn from each other. </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We created a new course in <a href="1c74867a-d7a0-440e-bec9-043057634f02.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="1c74867a-d7a0-440e-bec9-043057634f02.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Preparing to Build an Exemplary Moodle Course</em></span>, and now we will begin to build the course. Most of the initial course setup will be done through the course settings screen, which you may access through the <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> menu. Remember that, when you make changes in the <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> menu, your changes affect only the course you're developing. In our case, it might be a demo course or a template. Remember that changes in the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu or menu are site-wide and apply to all your courses.</p>
<p>As you begin configuring settings, it is a good idea to take a moment to remember that the goal is to be clear and concise as you select names, create links, and develop content.</p>
<p>The following course settings appear after clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Edit course settings</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">General</span> </li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Description</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Course format</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span></li>

<li><span class="packt_screen">Groups</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Role renaming</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tags</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>We will work through the basic menu items in the course settings that allow you to set up your course structure and organize your course. For additional information, remember that you can always visit the Moodle Docs at <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Main_page">https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Main_page</a>.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">General</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The first expandable menu, <span class="packt_screen">General</span>, gives you an opportunity to provide basic information about your course. Please keep in mind that at any time along the way, you may return to the course settings and edit the information.</p>
<p>If you get lost, just click on the name of your course in the menu, and then go to the upper right-hand corner and click the gearbox. Click <span class="packt_screen">Edit settings</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-374 image-border" src="assets/23735942-1be5-4273-97b0-a179800bffec.png" style="width:16.33em;height:22.08em;"/></p>
<p>While it is easy to edit your settings later, it's always best to plan well so that your course descriptions and listings are not ambiguous. The following steps will help you configure the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">My courses</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Edit settings</span>. The <span class="packt_screen">Edit course settings</span> screen will appear.</li>
<li>If the <span class="packt_screen">General settings</span> section is collapsed, click on the menu titled <span class="packt_screen">General</span> to expand it.</li>
<li>Enter data in the following fields: <span class="packt_screen">Course full name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Course short name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Course category, Course visibility</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Course start date</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Course end date</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Course ID number</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save and display</span> button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If your school or organization has a large number of courses, make sure that your course names (including the short names for your courses), the course IDs, and descriptions are consistent with your official course catalog. You will save yourself a great deal of time and frustration if you make sure that everything is consistent at the outset, rather than trying to retrofit or correct it later. Aim for clear, concise language and terminology that is consistent across your organization and its course catalog.</p>

<p>Although you may have a lengthy course description in the course catalog, along with additional text that describes the course outcomes, you may not want to include it all in the description.</p>
<p>Instead, in the <span class="packt_screen">Course summary</span> box, type a brief description that captures the essence of your course. Note that the box includes a number of web-editing tools that allow you to customize the appearance of the description. This capability will be very helpful later when we look at the overall appearance of the course page.</p>
<p>You may also use the <span class="packt_screen">Course summary files</span> box, which gives you the opportunity to upload files using the <span class="packt_screen">Add</span> option or by dragging and dropping them. Using <span class="packt_screen">Course summary files</span> gives you an opportunity to incorporate multiple modalities in adherence to the principles of UDL so that your course information is in text as well as audio and/or video format. By making your course information available in audio and video format, you will be making your material accessible to a wide array of learners.</p>
<p>For example, you may insert the link to an audio file (MP3 is ideal) or a video you have uploaded to YouTube, or insert the link to an embedded player. You may also include a link to an expanded text file that includes more detailed information.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A format allows you to develop the structure of your instructional material. This is a critical decision, and you must make it carefully. If at all possible, your format should be consistent across your curriculum so that all your courses have a similar look, feel, and organization:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375 image-border" src="assets/7c39610a-1e4e-41fe-9a75-e917af131436.png" style="width:54.08em;height:13.08em;"/></p>
<p>Notice there are a number of options that automatically generate a preformatted set of fields, which makes it easy for you to enter data. The various formats available are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Topics format</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Weekly format</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Social format</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Single activity format</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Most schools, colleges, universities, and organizations will use either the <span class="packt_screen">Topics</span> or the <span class="packt_screen">Weekly</span> formats. For example, if your college follows a 16-week semester format, it is often useful to follow a weekly format.</p>
<p>However, many colleges and universities offer the same courses over varying spans of time and may offer a 4-week, 8-week, 12-week, or 16-week term. In such cases, it is often helpful to select the <span class="packt_screen">Topics format</span> and then specify the timeline by means of a link to a calendar that includes the due dates for the course term.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The number of sections in a course corresponds to the <strong><span class="emphasis">functional chunks</span></strong> of the instructional material and activities that the students will work through in the course. Each organization will have its own approach to delivering coursework, with terms that may vary.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If your organization offers 4-week, 8-week, and 16-week options, it is a good idea to divide your content and activities into sections that can be either expanded or compressed. For example, you may select eight topics, and if you are in a position where your school offers the course in 4-week, 8-week, and 16-week terms, you may easily double up and accelerate through the course's content at twice the regular pace, or simply spread the content out over 2 weeks instead of one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your organization wants to offer everything in a single week, or the course is very brief and intended to be completed in several hours, you may wish to break the content into sections that correspond to the amount of time that will be spent on the task.</p>
<p>Keep the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your sections are consistent in terms of the amount of content that each section contains</li>
<li>Try to keep the amount of time needed to complete each task consistent</li>
</ul>

<p>Hidden sections allow you to avoid distracting your students with too much information on the screen. There may be a few situations where you may wish to make all sections visible. Such cases may occur in a very brief course that requires the students to have all the information while working through the course.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>You may either show all the sections on one page, or choose to show one section per page. If your course only contains two sections, you may wish to show them on a single page.</p>
<p>However, in the interest of clarity, it is often a good idea to show one section per page. Again, be sure to think ahead and consider what you'd like your students to be doing as they navigate through the course and what they should be able to do by the end of the course. Make sure that the structure of your course guides them along a clear path. Keep in mind that the course introduction topic will be visible on each page, even when you have one topic per page.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> menu, shown in the following screenshot, allows you to create a universal look and feel for your entire course:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-376 image-border" src="assets/d943566a-a828-450c-a18f-f5bbc5f33a02.png" style="width:48.58em;height:14.83em;"/></p>
<p>The options are self-explanatory, but there are a few key points to keep in mind as you organize your course:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Force language</span>: This option allows you to keep the Moodle interface in the language that you have selected, even if a student has designated a different language in his or her personal profile. This is new in 3.5. </li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Number of announcements</span>: This option gives you a chance to control how many recent announcements from the <span class="packt_screen">Announcements forum</span> will show in the <span class="packt_screen">Latest Announcements</span> block. Avoid including too many items, because they can be distracting and also chew up valuable digital real estate on your course page.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Show gradebook to students</span>: This option helps you to allow your students to check their grades, which can be extremely motivating and a key to their success.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Show activity reports</span>: This option permits students to see their own activity reports, which can be quite helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which applications are most useful for you? You have a number to choose from, ranging from antivirus plugins to webinars (BigBlueButton), chats, and books, which we will review later. As we begin to build content and resources, a quick review of the available resources and activities reveals that one indispensable tool is the media player. The media players plugin is located in the list of plugins under <span class="packt_screen">Plugins overview</span>, shown as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-377 image-border" src="assets/c8a3b962-9823-4803-aa3f-e0af03f7e6bf.png" style="width:65.08em;height:52.42em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Media Player Plugin under the list of Plugins</div>
<p>You can use it to help students play the videos without having to leave Moodle. Try to be as consistent as possible as you add resources, and make sure that they tie in closely to your course objectives. For example, for a course on bullying in the workplace, you may wish to use resources from a TED talk, which can be found at <a href="http://www.ted.com">http://www.ted.com</a>. TED talks, as well as other repositories of thought-provoking videos, are ideal for many reasons. First, they encourage engagement because they ask the learners to listen and to express an opinion. Second, TED talks allow students to discuss points, not only in the discussion board, but also by creating response videos. Finally, TED talks (as well as other educational repositories) are built in accordance with the principles of access and universal design. They provide videos with transcripts, and they supplement the video with relevant, peer-reviewed, high-quality readings. TED talks and other videos can be accessed by means of links and you can embed a YouTube player by copying and pasting HTML code. In order to make sure they work, you will need to enable the YouTube player as depicted in the screenshot. Please note that you'll need to scroll down the page quite a long way. The list of plug-ins is long:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Enabling YouTube player</div>
<p>It's a good idea to enable all the other players as well to maximize flexibility. </p>

<p>As you put together your course, it's easy to overwhelm your students with too much information. Further, they can be confused by unclear organization. Moodle's overall structure builds in order by grouping content in units determined by time or topic, but even so, it's important to keep your students motivated by giving them a clear way to organize their work and to set up deadlines. </p>

<p>You can help your students organize their time by providing an estimated time for a task. Also, be sure to provide clear limits for any writing assignments. For example, if you are assigning a short paper, be sure to provide a minimum and a maximum word count. That will help your students outline and draft the document, and it will help them dedicate the appropriate amount of time to it:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-379 image-border" src="assets/6de3f70e-b27c-4f63-9c87-ca7bf7b243fd.png" style="width:12.92em;height:22.92em;"/></p>
<p>We will go into more detail about Blocks in Moodle a bit later in this chapter. For now, let's focus on the <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span>. You can set up a calendar for your course in the <span class="packt_screen">Blocks</span> section. Once you have set up your calendar, you can include deadlines for drafts as well as for the final product. In addition to structuring their time, you will also help students with goal setting:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380 image-border" src="assets/c130b988-e9de-483b-bf0c-5d683f614ac7.png" style="width:40.67em;height:25.25em;"/></p>
<p>Another good way to help students with time management is to structure discussion posts so that they are not procrastinating and doing everything at the last minute. This should require students to have initial posts completed by one date, and then ask them to complete response posts 2 or 3 days later. By doing so, you'll space out the discussion posts and avoid the frustration of having everyone post in the final few hours before it's due. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>The idea of mapping workflows is something you are probably familiar with if you work with software or in project management. Basically, it's the idea that there is an ideal sequence for all of your activities and that one activity is often dependent on successfully completing another. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As you organize your course, be very mindful of the way that your assignments relate to each other, and how the learning objectives may build on each other. Before you start populating your Moodle shell and creating units, make a list of the concepts and skills they will need in order to accomplish the outcomes. Which is the most fundamental? Which is the most complex?</p>
<p>Here is another example where Bloom's taxonomy will help you. If you put your lower-level activities first, you'll have a very high likelihood of success. For example, include definitions and primary concepts first. Then follow with the concepts or skills they will need to complete. Then, ask them to apply and synthesize the information. </p>
<p>In the example of the <span class="packt_screen">Trends in Tourism </span>course note that the learning objectives appear in ascending order. As you build the course units, you can make sure that each concept, skill, or activity has sufficient scaffolding in order to be able to successfully complete the next one: </p>

<p>You may select an upper limit for files and uploads. The upper limit can be set by the Moodle administrator in accordance with the needs of those using the site. Our recommendation is to set the limit to 10 MB and to use best practices in web design such as file compression to keep file sizes to a minimum. For larger files, we recommend using repositories that integrate with Moodle such as YouTube, Dropbox, and Google Drive (depending on the administrator). For example, instead of uploading large files, such as videos, it's much better to use an HTML5-friendly video player, which you may embed. If your students are creating large files as part of their coursework, you may encourage them to upload those files to SoundCloud (if they're audio files), YouTube (if they're video files), and SlideShare (if they're PowerPoint presentations, and especially if they contain large graphics).</p>
<p>For maximum accessibility and to comply with the principles of universal design, keep in mind that HTML works very well with assistive technologies that convert text to voice for individuals with impaired vision. If possible, convert your presentations and documents to a format that can be used by assistive technology.</p>
<p>For individuals with impaired hearing and/or cognitive disabilities, providing a written script to accompany audio files can help you achieve the goal of using multiple modalities for optimizing student accessibility to the course content.</p>
<p>For student papers or projects, a maximum upload size of 2 MB is often sufficient, especially if they use ZIP files.</p>

<p>Along with the <span class="packt_screen">Show gradebook to students</span> option, the <span class="packt_screen">Completion tracking</span> option can help students maintain their levels of motivation and develop a positive "I can do it!" approach, which translates to self-efficacy and self-determination.</p>
<p>By being able to track when they complete their units and/or activities, students can stay motivated and continue to set and meet their personal goals.</p>

<p>Moodle allows you to set up student groups while you are developing the framework of the course. It is often a good idea to set up groups, even if you have collaborative activities, or you'd like to give individuals a chance to work and share in informal teams. Groups can also be very effective for peer reviews of papers or projects.</p>
<p>However, if your course does not include collaborative/team activities or peer reviews, setting up groups can add an unnecessary level of complexity to your course.</p>

<p>Moodle's default names for roles within the course are very straightforward and intuitive, especially the roles of <span class="packt_screen">Manager</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Teacher</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Student</span>.</p>
<p>However, you may wish to rename the roles to correspond with the role names used in your organization. For example, a corporation may prefer the word facilitator instead of teacher and a student may be termed as team member or learner.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>A cautionary note is in order here. If your organization has a number of courses, it is a good idea to make sure that the roles have consistent names and that you do not rename roles in every course. Maintaining consistency will help you avoid confusion and frustration.</p>

<p>Including a calendar which demarcates course events can help your students stay on track. To add a calendar, you will first add a <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span> block as shown in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Turn editing on</span> button.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Add a block</span> menu, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add...</span> option.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span> in the drop-down menu. A <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span> block will appear on the course page.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Actions</span> icon in the <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span> block and select <span class="packt_screen">Configure Calendar block</span> to configure the options you wish to have displayed:</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add events, just click on the month of the event in the <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span> block, and then click on <span class="packt_screen">New event</span>. The new event can apply to the course, the user, or the website:</p>

<p>Instead of incorporating a large graphic showing your institution along with the its mission and vision statement, you may wish to use an HTML block to include a quick link to the institution's web page; this is most useful for your purposes.</p>

<p>To keep your website very neat, it is often useful to gather all student support sites in a single place.

<p>Moodle gives you many options for design, and you may notice that web-editing boxes pop up almost every time you add content. While it's very tempting to use a wide array of colors, fonts, and symbols, be sure to keep it simple. The following are a few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose fonts carefully and use them consistently.</li>
<li>Use a sans serif font, such as Arial or Helvetica. They are easier for people with impaired vision to read. They will be displayed uniformly in most browsers.</li>
<li>If you are using graphics with text, be aware that magnification software often results in highly pixelated text and can be hard to read.</li>
<li>If you code in HTML, use relative sizes rather than absolute sizes for the font. If you use absolute sizes, you essentially <em>lock down</em> the sizing and then it is not possible for magnification software to enlarge it.</li>
<li>Avoid using too many colors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Images can be a very powerful way to add personality and individual branding to your courses. However, it's also easy to add too many images or to overwhelm the students with large, potentially irrelevant images. For this reason, be sure to keep in mind the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use meaningful graphics</li>
<li>Use JPG or GIF image formats only</li>
<li>Place them so that they add and reinforce meaning (rather than distract or confuse students)</li>
<li>Optimize the size of images so that they load quickly</li>
<li>If you need to use large graphics, create a clickable thumbnail that expands into a large graphic (for example, a map)</li>

<p>Let's return, for a moment, to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu. One of the ways to change the look and feel of your course is using themes. Moodle has a wide array of built-in themes that can be utilized to give your course a customized look and feel. It is often worthwhile to use a theme developed by a Moodle developer. Many are free and others can be licensed. Themes can be particularly useful if you are using multiple devices and you want your course to automatically display content well for tablets, laptops, smartphones, desktops, and other handheld devices.</p>
<p>For example, if you would like a theme that is optimized for multiple devices and works equally well with laptops, tablets, and smartphones, you may wish to select the <span class="packt_screen">Boost</span> theme. It is flexible for individuals with impaired vision, and the font sizes and column heights can be adjusted by the users. </p>
<p>If you would like a clean, crisp look for your course that enables you to easily customize it to get a recognizable, unique brand, you may wish to select the fluid-width, three-column <strong>Clean</strong> theme. <span>Clean (or MoodleCloud) </span>is a responsive, bootstrap-based theme. It is one of three standard Moodle themes. </p>
<p>The third standard Moodle theme is <strong>More.</strong> It is customizable from within the theme. Unfortunately, it is not standard in MoodleCloud, but it is available in Moodle 3.5. </p>

<p>In this chapter, we explored how to organize your course in terms of its structure, format, and appearance. We learned the best way to use Moodle's built-in course settings and elements to create a framework that can be consistent and flexible for all your courses. For example, you can develop a demo course and use it as a template or guide for future courses. We discussed the reasons for making certain decisions as we develop the framework and how to think about the best ways to make your course accessible for all your students.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will guide you through developing content and activities for your course. We'll take a close look at how best to match your course materials with the overall purpose of the course and how to do so in a way that is motivating and engaging to students and encourages students' success.</p>
