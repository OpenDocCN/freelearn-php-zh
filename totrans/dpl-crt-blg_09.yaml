    some of the more advanced or interesting features in Drupal in order to give you
    the opportunity to add that *special something* to your site. Whether it is new
    type of content, an advertising policy to generate revenue from traffic, or even
    a way of providing nice, dynamic content, you should find something to add value
    to your site in here.

  zh: 我们将首先查看一些模块的集合，这些模块展示了Drupal中一些更高级或有趣的功能，以便给你机会给你的网站添加一些*特别的东西*。无论是新类型的内容、一种从流量中赚取收入的广告策略，还是提供良好、动态内容的方式，你都应该在这里找到一些可以增加网站价值的东西。
- en: Remember though, that if what is required is not available in the default distribution
    or in any of the modules, you are not totally out of luck. The chances are someone
    else in the community has had to do something similar before, and you should get
    a few helpful responses on the forums explaining at least some of what you need.
    If at some point you do manage to create something utterly fantastic, please give
    back to the community by sharing your work with others.

    to a site in order to get it just right. Accordingly, we will look at some interesting
    embellishments using code that is freely available on the Internet. Incorporating
    JavaScript and other small, working units of code (commonly known as widgets)
    is the perfect way to enhance your site without having to learn everything about

    always fun to be able to do something out of the ordinary with your site, and
    working with your theme files, using HTML, PHP, and CSS, is great training for

    backups of the whole site, including the database, from time to time (preferably
    each time you successfully add a new feature). Further, you should also back up
    each of the pages you are working on before you begin working with them. The topic
    of making backups is discussed in the *Running your Website* chapter, which follows
    this one—I mention this just in case you feel it is time to make a backup of what
    you have now before you begin fiddling around.

    is that not only are they open source, but you can also combine them with pretty
    much any other technology you can get your hands on. There is a huge online programming
    community, and many people make their neat little scripts openly available for
    the likes of you and me to simply include into our own sites as we please. Not
    all are free, but many are, and many more are very cheap; so it is always worthwhile
    looking around at some of the scripting sites to see what you can pick up.

    to create responsive and dynamic web page elements. The goal of this chapter,

    and as promised, the **Latest News** article is now displayed in all its glory.

    to keep the attached files' sizes small so that users don't click on a link and
    then lose interest waiting for it to be displayed. If you want a bit of a challenge,
    write a PHP script that converts the`<body>` section of other posts into a file
    so that you can add interesting posts or articles without having to manually create
    the attached content files.

    for very little effort. That's all we have time for, but now that you know how
    it's done, I leave it in your capable hands to come up with novel ways of accomplishing
    whatever important tasks you might have.

    modules available for us. Hopefully, you will find that you now know enough about
    the use of modules to feel confident in using any one you choose. Ultimately,
    you might end up creating and sharing your own modules for use by other members
    of the community, but for now, being able to generate a bit of cash on the side
    using AdSense as well as create your own custom content types should give you
    plenty to work with.

    on the Internet in order to find complete solutions, or even partial code pieces
    that can be modified and/or incorporated into your site in order to give some
    great functionality. This has hopefully highlighted the fact that even if you
    aren't a programming expert, with a bit of searching and some basic knowledge
    of a few important web-based technologies, you can create some powerful features
    for your site.

    something you want to add that was not discussed directly here, you should find
    that you have enough general experience to go ahead and make whatever changes
    you want. Gaining the confidence to create an advanced website is simply about
    taking the time to learn your way around things, and this book has given you the
    platform from which to start.

    website, and doesn't relate to the development of your site as directly as these
    first nine have. Because of this, I would like to take the time to congratulate
    you on finishing your website now, as well as assure you that all the hard development
    work is done.

    free to skip the next chapter and go directly to the Appendix, which outlines
    how to properly deploy your new site to its home on the Web. You can always come
    back to [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Running Your Website") and learn how
    to maintain and administer your site once it is up and running.
