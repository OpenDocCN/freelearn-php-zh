                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In the last chapter, you learned the best way to develop a course in Moodle that would be used for self-directed and self-guided students. In <span>that case, the focus was primarily on creating a course that was very clear, self-explanatory, and easy to follow.</span></p>
<p>Now, as we turn to other types of courses, you'll find that most of the guidelines you followed in developing courses for independent study also apply to courses that are instructor-led and include groups of students who work together. The group, or the cohort, progresses together, and the advantage of having an individual instructor lies in the fact that he/she can provide guidance and personalized feedback to the students.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you'll learn how to best set up a cohort-based course that allows teacher-student interaction. We'll review the best structure to use and the best combination of plugins, resources, and activities to make sure that your course is very flexible and meets the needs of students and teachers, and also provides behind-the-scenes support, which includes Moodle administrators and instructional designers.</p>
<p>We'll start by looking at the main features of an instructor-led, cohort-based course, and keep in mind that the course revolves around instructor communication and guidance along with coordinated student performance.</p>
<p>Then, we'll look at the main sources of student and instructor anxiety. Students on an online course that is guided by an instructor are often most worried about the expectations of the instructor. Further, they want to make sure that they are not going to get lost while looking for the course material and exams, and can perform well in a timely fashion. Instructors want to be able to communicate effectively with students and provide timely and effective feedback on assessments.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring global settings for instructor-led, cohort-based courses</li>
<li>Modifying the appearance globally, including themes</li>
<li>Selecting the ideal plugins, activities, resources, and assessments</li>
<li>Developing different ways for instructors to interact with students</li>
<li>Organizing course material and activities</li>
<li>Selecting effective assessments</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Characteristics of instructor-led, cohort-based courses</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The traditional face-to-face college course is a cohort-based course and has a fixed number of students who progress together to complete the course, and they're led by an instructor who guides them and provides feedback and assessments.</p>
<p>Online courses are very similar. The only difference is that there are more ways for students to communicate with each other, since they're working in an online environment and may be working together for one class or a series of classes.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of instructor-led, cohort-based courses include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A common start and end date</li>
<li>A fixed timeline that keeps all students working together</li>
<li>Communication with the instructor, who provides guidance and feedback</li>
<li>Student interaction and collaboration, with a focus on communication</li>
<li>Assessments with instructor guidance and feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an interesting fact that most online courses in US higher education are cohort based, and they are regularly compared with face-to-face courses in terms of performance, course completion, and satisfaction.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>You can learn more about online learning in US higher education in the Sloan Consortium's eleventh annual report, 2013 – <span class="emphasis"><em>Grade Change: Tracking Online Education in the United States</em>,</span> at the Sloan-C website at <a href="http://sloanconsortium.org/publications/survey/grade-change-2013">http://sloanconsortium.org/publications/survey/grade-change-2013</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>As in the case of self-paced independent study courses, instructor-led, cohort-based courses can vary widely in their length, scope, complexity, and goals. In colleges and universities, some can require as few as four weeks to complete. Others, however, focus on 8 week or 16 week semester-long courses. Some organizations may cover the material in 4 weeks, with four separate weekly milestones (topics or units). Online instructor-led, cohort-based courses can be offered by colleges, universities, corporations, not-for-profit organizations, retailers, and other organizations that need to provide educational courses and training.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Benefits and limitations of cohort-based courses in Moodle</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Many online courses offered by colleges and universities are set up to mirror the face-to-face arrangement of traditional courses, and follow, more or less, the same philosophy. The focus is on the content that is accessed and discussed by class members in an orderly fashion as the term progresses. Guidance is provided by an instructor who explains the material, provides feedback, and shows students the best way to learn and perform so that they can achieve the course goals and outcomes.</p>
<p>The following are the benefits of cohort-based courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>They improve communication with peers</li>
<li>The students have an orderly progression through the resources and activities</li>
<li>They let the instructor provide proper guidance on performing well and achieving the desired course outcomes</li>
<li>They are built on a template that can be copied across multiple sections</li>
<li>They offer a sense of community and connection</li>
</ul>
<p>While cohort-based courses can be popular and provide support for students, there are a few limitations. Disadvantages of cohort-based courses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student may make slow progress through the course</li>
<li>There's some inflexibility with respect to assignments and the pace of the course</li>
<li>There are difficulties in communicating with peers if students are in different time zones and do not have continuous access to the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>For many institutions, the benefits of cohort-based courses far outweigh the limitations, and the fact that course shells or templates once built can be copied, archived, and deployed makes it convenient to run many groups at the same time. Although it is true that courses for independent study can be copied and deployed, the user experience is not the same as that in a cohort-based course. In a well run and successful cohort-based course, students have a feeling of community and support.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up your instructor-led course – Global settings</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we mentioned in the introduction, probably the two most important considerations in an instructor-led, cohort-based course are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity with respect to student performance expectations</strong>: What do I do? When do I do it? Where do I get the materials? How and when am I assessed?</li>
<li><strong>Communication with the instructor</strong>: How do I contact my students? How can I provide feedback that they will see in a timely way? How do my students expect me to communicate with them?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can make sure that we achieve the goals of clarity and communication by selecting a framework that gives us the ability to customize the appearance of the course.</p>
<p>The place to get started is in the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu on the main page. If you expand the menu, you will see two key bullet submenus: <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span>. We will start with <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> because we want to select a theme that will make it easy for us to create clarity and communicate.</p>

<p>As we consider the appearance of our course—the theme we want to use—we need to consider the way that our students are likely to interact in an online environment. Rapid communication with students and the ability to interact and ask questions will help ensure your students feel comfortable and confident.</p>
<p>Boost is the default theme for Moodle 3.5, and it is uniquely useful for Moodle cohorts because it incorporates new functionality. However, you may prefer Moodlecloud, which is also an option on MoodleCloud. Moodlecloud is based on the Clean theme, and it is easy to use and has a very open look and feel since the navigation bar is on the left. </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As in earlier versions, Moodle 3.5 has BigBlueButton web conferencing software which can be used for presentations to cohort members, and can be used for a collaborative web conference. The presentations are synchronous (live) but can be used for asynchronous purposes (and can be archived later): </p>
<ol>
<li>Add an activity for the topic of your choice. </li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">BigBlueButtonBN</span>.</li>
<li>Enter the settings <span>in <span class="packt_screen">General settings</span> and also in <span class="packt_screen">Activity/Room settings</span></span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-410 image-border" src="assets/0868265f-22fb-4124-ab6e-4f760c9e56c4.png" style="width:42.58em;height:41.42em;"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Keep in mind that you will need to assign roles in BigBlueButtonBN. BigBlueButtonBN roles must be assigned separately. They do not correspond (unless you want them to) to the roles you assigned for the class in general:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411 image-border" src="assets/5312aa58-e694-4f97-987c-905dd908d5d0.png" style="width:61.58em;height:35.92em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>After you have added users, you can select who can be a moderator or user. The roles are not permanent. You can always go in and change them. </li>
</ol>
<p>The following screenshot will help you see how the participants are assigned their roles in BigBlueButton:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-412 image-border" src="assets/44d224f9-54f0-499a-a37c-687628b346be.png" style="width:40.33em;height:14.50em;"/></p>
<p>Once the webinar is configured, you can join the session at any time. Please note that you'll need to run Adobe Flash. </p>
<p>When you launch your webinar, you can switch roles so that more than one person can present. You can use webcams if individuals are talking and want to record themselves. However, you may wish to simply upload graphics or a presentation which you can then annotate in the central whiteboard space. </p>
<p>You can allow your participants to chat quietly on the side. If you have a large number of audience members and just one presenter, it's a good idea to mute all the users except the presenter:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-413 image-border" src="assets/5f24fb7a-bb0e-49f5-8f0a-e85654e6ff4b.png" style="width:85.33em;height:39.67em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Adding files to your presentation</div>
<p>After you have completed your webinar, you may save it so that others can review it. You can also reschedule the webinar if you were not happy with it or you need to include additional presenters and materials:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-414 image-border" src="assets/bcf634f8-ea43-491f-9a1d-29e803e5a27f.png" style="width:85.33em;height:55.58em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Uploading a presentation</div>
<p>If you want to upload another presentation or graphic, you may. The <span><span class="packt_screen">Upload Presentation</span> </span> icon is what you click in order to select and upload a file. If you want to launch a poll, just click on the icon next to the <span class="packt_screen">Upload Presentation</span> icon. I've circled both in the screenshot. </p>

<p>As we configure the courses and set the global settings, let's review the plugins.</p>
<p>Let's make sure that we have configured the plugins so that they are ideal for instructor-led, cohort-based courses and that they help us achieve our goals of clarity for students and good communication for instructors.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Forum</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While we are in the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, we can easily look at the global settings for our forums so that all the courses have the look, feel, and functionality that is ideal for a cohort-based course. We are at a deciding point because we need to determine how to make sure people know which students are replying to threads, and how people are responding.</p>
<p>Because of the discussions in response to a thread that the instructor has posted and the desire of the students to see peer responses, it's best to select a threaded response.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at the settings by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Activity modules</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span> screen, set the option <span class="packt_screen">Display mode</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Display replies in threaded form</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you will configure the option for the email address in the reply of the post. Specify the length of posts and the number of discussions per page, and indicate the maximum number of attachments that are allowed per post. </p>
<p>The decisions that you make are important because you'll be using the <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span> module in all your cohort-based courses for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>News and announcements</li>
<li>Questions for the instructor</li>
<li>Student lounge</li>
<li>Topic-specific graded discussions</li>
<li>Topic-specific links to discussions on readings and activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Planning your forum and configuring it globally will help you make sure that the course is consistent and students and instructors can use it as a very powerful tool to stay on track with the course.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Calendar</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A calendar can be the heart and soul of your cohort-based course. It's a place where you can easily connect the topics to the specific launch and due dates for readings, activities, and assessments. You can enter a very detailed list of events or include only the key ones. The best approach is to be sure to include key events, but avoid too much clutter or information that could be distracting.</p>
<p>Let's set up a calendar for a course that lasts a semester, or 16 weeks, using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span> page, modify <span class="packt_screen">Days to look ahead</span> to <span class="packt_screen">120</span> and change the default settings for <span class="packt_screen">Events to Lookahead</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll revisit many of the global settings as we begin to work on the design of your course. Keep in mind that the site-wide settings are the global default settings and they do not contain the information that is specific to an individual course.</p>

<p>Now that you've configured the course at site level, you will need to configure elements at the course level and make sure that they are ideal for instructor-led, cohort-based courses. So, go to the <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> menu in the <span class="packt_screen">ADMINISTRATION</span> block.</p>

<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">ADMINISTRATION</span> block, go to <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Edit settings</span>.</li>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Course format</span> section, select the <span class="packt_screen">Topics format</span> menu from the drop-down menu in the <span class="packt_screen">Format</span> field, and then, add at least two additional topics to the number of sections (in addition to those that will be units in your course). As in the case of an independent study course, you'll use one of the topics for the instructional materials that you'll be using in the entire course. The other topic will include practice tests/exams/quizzes.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> section, for <span class="packt_screen">Show gradebook to students</span>, select <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Completion tracking</span> section, for <span class="packt_screen">Enable completion tracking</span>, select <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Groups</span> section, make sure that you include groups. So, select <span class="packt_screen">Visible groups</span> from the drop-down menu in <span class="packt_screen">Group mode</span>. After that, click on <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span>.</li>

<p>In the previous chapter, we discussed the ideal format for files your students will download.</p>
<p>However, how will your students make files and how can they collaborate? There are a number of open source word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation tools, that also allow integrated file sharing.</p>

<p>There are a number of Microsoft Office-compatible programs that are cloud based and can enable students to create and format documents, upload, share, and collaborate. Some of these are listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Docs</strong>: Visit <a href="http://docs.google.com">http://docs.google.com</a> for more information. Students can upload and save documents to Google Drive. They can then edit them using Google's built-in cloud-based editing program, which includes spreadsheet editing as well. If your students wish to create a website or a document in HTML, it is probably best to use Google Sites (<a href="https://sites.google.com/">https://sites.google.com/</a><span>) rather than Google Docs.</span></li>
<li><strong>WPS Office Free</strong>: Visit <a href="https://www.wps.com/office-free?__c=1">https://www.wps.com/office-free?__c=1</a> for more information. WPS Office 2016 Free comes with word processing (Writer), presentation, and spreadsheet programs. It also includes cloud backup.

<p>There is an activity called <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span> can be easily configured so that students can upload files or copy and paste text that you can grade and return. To work with the <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span> activity, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Adding a new Assignment</span> page, click on the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> section.</li>
<li>Fill in the following fields: <span class="packt_screen">Assignment name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Description</span>.</li>
<li>Open the <span class="packt_screen">Availability</span> section and fill in the required fields.</li>
<li>Then, in <span class="packt_screen">Submission types</span>, be sure to select <span class="packt_screen">File submissions</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Online text</span>. Selecting <span class="packt_screen">Online text</span> will allow students to copy and paste text if they do not have a file format that is compatible. You may also wish to include a link to <span>BigBlueButton </span>if you want your students to record collaborations. </li>
<li>In <span class="packt_screen">Feedback types</span>, be sure to select <span class="packt_screen">Feedback comments</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Feedback files</span>.</li>
<li>There are other fields that give you options. The <span class="packt_screen">Grade</span> settings are of particular importance because they give you a chance to tie the assignment to the gradebook, set the standard grade points or display of units, and select how you'll grade the activities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your gradebook can be configured in <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span>, which controls the look, feel, and functionality of your courses globally.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at how we can configure the grade reports within the course by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">ADMINISTRATION</span> block, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Grades</span>.</li>
<li>Now, again in the <span class="packt_screen">ADMINISTRATION</span> block, click on <span class="packt_screen">Grade administration</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Course grade settings</span> and review the settings on its page.</li>
<li>Review <span class="packt_screen">Letters</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Grade administration</span> menu to set grade ranges and other settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that whether or not an item shows up in the gradebook, the grading criteria for each item is determined when you add graded activities (which include activities such as <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Workshop</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span>).</p>

<p>A simple way to back up or archive courses for the future is to move the courses after they have been taught to a different place in Moodle.</p>
<p>For example, you can move the courses from the current semester or term to a new location in your Moodle installation, link from the front page, and then change the settings so that they are not visible to anyone except administrators.</p>
<p>The courses can then be backed up and purged of any student or instructor information when appropriate and serve as templates or cloneable shells for future courses.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we've learned the best way to develop and configure your course for instructor-led cohorts, which are the most commonly found online courses at colleges and universities. We chose cohort-based courses because they are very popular when students are working together on a topic that requires time to develop skills and knowledge. Cohort-based courses are often very useful in a corporation or training organization because they involve individuals who may be working together in teams or across the organization.</p>
<p>We've learned how to configure global settings so that your courses can maintain clarity with respect to what students must study and achieve. We've also looked at how to configure the settings so that your instructors are able to communicate in a number of different ways, given that students may have different social networking preferences and habits. Then, we reviewed the best themes and how to set up the course for maximum functionality. We reviewed how students will work and how to help them take advantage of open-source software for the work they submit, both individually and collaboratively.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at the best ways to set up resources and activities so that students feel comfortable and how to set up forums to encourage student interaction and instructor feedback.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will guide you through developing courses that are student-centric and include collaborative activities. We'll take a close look at how to configure your courses and determine which resources, activities, and assessments will be the best fit for your collaboration-focused courses.</p>
