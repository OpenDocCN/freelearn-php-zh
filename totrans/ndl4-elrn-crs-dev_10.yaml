- en: At the heart of Moodle is the theory of learning that people learn best when
    they learn from each other, through meaningful interaction. Some of this interaction
    occurs in collaborative activities. However, the bulk of this interaction will
    occur in social settings, in synchronous or live chats or in asynchronous discussion
    board areas, called **forums** in Moodle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Social course activities encourage student-to-student interaction. Peer interaction
    is one of the most powerful learning tools that Moodle offers. It not only encourages
    learning but also encourages exploration. This tool also makes courses more interesting,
    because students can share their knowledge, which increases student participation
    and satisfaction. Peer sharing is part of the social constructionist approach
    to learning and forms the foundation of Moodle. This chapter will teach you how
    to add communication activities to a course and how to make the best use of them.
    This includes chats, forums, and other forms of social media. Moodle 4.0 takes
    a social approach and allows notifications and communications in the same way
    as social media apps. It also uses redesigned, attractive navigation icons. In
    addition to enhancing engagement and ease of navigation, Moodle 4.0 also provides
    more ways for the teacher or manager to keep the student on track and not allow
    them to move ahead before they're ready.

    As you review your learning objectives and seek to map the course materials with
    the course activities, think about how you can make your course structured around
    forums and chats so that the focus stays on student engagement. This sets up a
    sense of wonder and discovery as students dig into the content, and then share
    their ideas and impressions. If you create a forum around solving a problem together
    or exploring aspects of something mysterious, you will create an unforgettable
    learning experience.

    abandon. Or you could pose a question that requires some digging and some imagination:
    *Imagine that you time-traveled to a time and place where you had to become a

    can be set so that messages can be received, even if you do not have Moodle open
    in your browser. Keep in mind that Chat is a feature that has been in Moodle since
    its early versions, and it is not as up-to-date as other activities in Moodle.
    Nevertheless, it is integrated into Moodle and thus can be convenient, especially
    if you don''t want to go outside of Moodle (into Teams and so on) for a chat or
    messaging feature. Chats are automatically saved, so they can help an instructor
    make sure they have responded to the student''s questions. So, let''s get started:'

- en: Sometimes, it is helpful to have synchronous or real-time communication. We
    often use our smartphones for texting when we need a quick answer or want to ask
    a rather informal question. Now that many institutions use Teams, Google products,
    or Zoom for chat and real-time video conferencing, Chat can be built into Moodle.
    Moodle has its own Chat, but there are advantages to using your institution's
    platform, such as Teams. In this case, you would log into Moodle, but your Teams
    application would be simultaneously running (as it usually is) at the same time
    on your desktop, tablet, or phone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your institution does not use Teams or another cloud-based productivity or
    collaboration app and prefers that everyone participate only in Moodle, Moodle's
    Chat function is a good option. For example, if you are a training organization
    and you are attracting students from many organizations, groups, or schools, it
    will be impossible to communicate through everyone's Teams, Zoom, or Google accounts.
    Instead, it is better to use Moodle's Chat. Also, individuals may use WhatsApp
    or phone texts. However, if you use Moodle's Chat module, you can save the chat
    conversations within Moodle. Saving the transcripts of chats can be very important
    for instructors who want to ensure that they are communicating, and also for students
    who may wish to keep a record of what they have said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps the most popular form of text generated in an online course is that
    which is generated through live captioning, which is available through Zoom and
    PowerPoint, just to name two. The transcript can be saved and used as notes. Instructors
    who find they say their most insightful things while giving a lecture can use
    the live transcript chat text as a source of ideas for their next article or book.
    It is useful to keep in mind that collaborative chat was the method used to write
    the book *Angrynomics* ([https://www.gapingvoid.com/blog/2020/02/27/why-we-wrote-angrynomics-by-mark-blyth/](https://www.gapingvoid.com/blog/2020/02/27/why-we-wrote-angrynomics-by-mark-blyth/)),
    which came about as two authors recorded their conversations and used speech-to-text
    to transcribe them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of Chat is that your students may use speech-to-text applications
    (built-in as closed-captioning in Zoom, YouTube Live, and Google, for example),
    which automatically inserts a microphone avatar or logo. You can use it as an
    assistive technology as it is a good way to have students practice speech-to-text
    and can also be very helpful for those students who may have limited vision or
    limited physical mobility.

    can enter this chat room at any time. As with other activities, access restrictions
    can be set to override this default. The **Course Chat Room** area can become
    a meeting place for students in the course, where they can come to collaborate
    on work and exchange information. If you give group assignments or have students
    rate other students' assignments, consider adding a chat room to the course and
    encouraging students to use it. Also, consider saving transcripts of the chat
    sessions so that they can act as other reference tools for students.

    you can be available for questions. Ensure that you save the transcript, because
    many people may have the same questions but, perhaps, cannot attend at the same

    in which it has been imported from a different system.

    the **Latest announcements** block.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we mentioned previously, a very convenient way to deliver content is to create
    forums that correspond to the weeks in the course. For example, if you have an
    8-week course, you can create eight separate forums. Each one can correspond to
    specific content (text, blocks, video, audio, presentations, and more) that you
    would like the students to read. By putting the links in the forum threads, you
    can ensure that everyone progresses through the course at the same pace and covers
    the same content. You can then include a few questions in the forum and open threads
    that allow students to ask questions, as well as reflect on the material. It's
    a good place to add a few reflective questions. As you develop your questions,
    make sure that they are structured so that each person can give a unique, personal
    answer. For example, you may ask students to find an example of an article or
    website that relates to the topic. You can also ask them to describe their own
    experiences. Avoid questions that can be provided with yes/no answers or ones
    that will result in the same response.

    necessary content and reviews to the assignments. For example, you may wish to
    have students write essays about readings. If you do so, you can open up a forum
    in which you describe the paper, include expectations, and even incorporate a
    rubric. For example, if you ask students to write a short response to a reading,
    you can post a link to the reading, a series of guiding questions, and a description
    of the structure of the paper they are to write. Then, you can include a checklist
    of the criteria (number of words, content, structure, organization, grammar, mechanics,
    and so on). You can open threads for students to ask questions, and you can put
    a link to Dropbox so that they can, with a single click, submit their assignments.

    you wish to make, you can be assured that most of your students will see the changes

    "one-stop shopping" point for assignments.

    library or web-based repositories and publications.

    establish good ground rules because the forum is, after all, a public place. If
    you want a more detailed and granular kind of peer review interaction, and you''d
    like to be able to easily grade each interaction, it is better to "upgrade" to
    Moodle''s Workshop activity. If you use the forum as a place for students to start
    a thread, post a draft, and then respond to each other''s drafts, you''ll need
    to ensure that they keep their comments positive and productive. One good way
    to do that is to provide a checklist of items to respond to. If you want to grade
    each checklist item, it''s better to use the Workshop activity rather than a Forum

    forums for assessment review, practice, and performance is to tie the forum title
    to the topics covered in the assessment. Then, you can create a link to the key
    content covered and describe the learning goals or outcomes. After that, you can
    include a few review questions. Ensure that your practice or review questions
    are in the same format as the ones that they will be taking for their final assessments.

    can encourage students to learn from each other. Sometimes, it is useful to have
    students collaborate on a single document. Students can collaborate in a shared
    document. In a Moodle Forum, having a collaborative document can encourage people
    to add content. It's not granularly peer-reviewed and assessed as in a Moodle
    Workshop, nor is it intended to be a wiki. It's simply to encourage engagement.
    It may seem complicated, but it's quite simple, especially if your school or organization
    uses Microsoft Office 365 products and OneDrive, or if students have a Google
    account that gives them access to Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and more. They can
    also use other collaborative spaces, such as Dropbox. For more complex tasks,
    students may collaborate in a spreadsheet that has a timeline and critical path.
    Some organizations use project management tools such as Basecamp or Slack for
    informing team members of milestones and building in automatic alerts. Google
    Drive may be one of the easier approaches because it integrates with email and
