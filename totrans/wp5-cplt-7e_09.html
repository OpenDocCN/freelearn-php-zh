<p>One of the greatest advantages of using a <strong>content management system</strong> (<strong>CMS</strong>) for your website is that you are able to change the look and feel of your website without being knowledgeable about HTML and CSS. Almost every CMS allows users to customize the look of their website without having to worry about their content being changed. These managed looks are referred to as themes. On other platforms (for example, Blogger, Joomla, and Drupal), themes are sometimes called <strong>templates</strong> or <strong>layouts</strong>.</p>
<p>Thousands of WordPress themes are available for download free of cost, and thousands more are available at a pretty low cost. Some of the free themes are developed by members of the WordPress community and listed on WordPress' main website at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a>, while others can be found across the web on independent sites.</p>
<p>Before you are ready to set about changing the theme of your website, you will want to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some basic factors about the theme you're considering</li>
<li>How to find quality themes</li>
<li>How to choose the theme that best suits your content and audience</li>
<li>How to install a theme</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss all of these topics. This chapter is a ground-up guide to using themes. And, in the following chapters, we will discuss the advanced topic of developing your own themes.</p>

<p>There are dozens of websites that offer WordPress themes for you to download and to install on your own website. Many theme developers offer their themes for free, whereas some charge a small fee. Of course, if you cannot find a free theme that fits your needs, you can always hire a theme developer to create a customized theme for you, or you can be your own theme developer (see <a href="eb8f8110-a317-4b1f-afd4-b2bf72714b39.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a><em><a href="eb8f8110-a317-4b1f-afd4-b2bf72714b39.xhtml" target="_blank"/>, Developing Your Own Theme</em>).</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">WordPress Theme Directory</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The first place you should always go to when looking for a theme is the official WordPress <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Theme Directory</strong></span> at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a>. This is where everyone in the WordPress community uploads their free themes and tags them with keywords that describe the basic look, layout, and functions of their themes, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/05119337-5a0e-4330-bb55-dcde4d8bce8e.png" style="width:39.33em;height:33.75em;" width="885" height="760"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To get a better idea of what a theme looks like, apart from what's offered by the thumbnail, just click on the title of the theme (in my case, <span class="packt_screen">Hestia</span>, at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/">https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/</a>). You'll be taken to the theme's details page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/53d83ba3-f096-428a-a85b-95b0d46085ec.png" width="899" height="727"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The preceding page shows you the theme's description, all of the tags that apply to it, the average rating given to it by other users, and some comments on the theme. If you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Preview</span> button, you'll get to see the theme actually in action, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5dd7c741-8bff-4771-9871-e274b9031108.png" width="1308" height="636"/></p>
<p>As you browse through the theme directory, make sure to take note of any theme you find that you like; we'll discuss how to add it to your WordPress site later on in this chapter.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that each theme in the official directory comes with its own <span class="packt_screen">Support</span> section and user reviews section. You can view them by clicking on one of the links available in the right sidebar, as highlighted in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/2e5b7b3f-ee4a-4ac4-86f8-70505ae746d2.png" width="924" height="728"/></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Main types of themes</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we mentioned before, there are two main types of themes—<strong>free themes</strong> and <strong>premium</strong> (<strong>paid</strong>) <strong>themes</strong>. Also, if you don't consider price being a factor here, we can also divide themes into four other groups<span>—</span><strong>standard themes</strong>, <strong>child themes</strong>, <strong>starter themes</strong>, and <strong>theme frameworks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Child themes</strong>: We will discuss this in detail in the following chapters, so, for now, let's say that a child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality of another theme, the parent.</li>
<li><strong>Standard themes</strong>: These are themes that are meant to work in their original form while allowing some basic customizations and tuning up (just like the default theme, <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Starter themes</strong>: These are a relatively new concept in the WordPress world. In short, when using them, you are encouraged to modify the theme files directly, and effectively make them the foundation of the theme you're currently building. As the name suggests, they provide a great starting point for your own theme to be built upon. They are a great solution for developers, but not so much for regular users, who just want to download a great theme and be able to use it right out the box.</li>
<li><strong>Theme frameworks</strong>: These are somewhat similar to starter themes (they are meant to be used as the base for your custom theme development), but they usually deliver a larger range of various built-in features, plus they can be used straight out of the box as a standalone theme (at least to some extent).</li>
</ul>
<p>In some way, the main difference between starter themes and theme frameworks is that when you get a starter theme, you must put work into it beforehand to make the theme functional. With frameworks, you get a functional theme right away, but then you are expected to spend time tweaking its various elements to make it fit your site hand-in-glove. The thing with both theme frameworks and starter themes is that they are usually highly code-heavy products, which means that you can't really take full advantage of them if you don't possess any programming skills or don't have anyone on your payroll who does. This may not sound that clear right now, and that's okay. We will explain this concept some more in the following chapters.</p>
<p>In the end, standard themes are what most bloggers and site owners work with during their WordPress journeys, especially if they don't need any advanced customizations or don't run purpose-specific websites (such as animated sites and interactive sites).</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Finding more themes</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you can't find a theme that you would like in the official directory, you have other options. There are third-party sites with free themes, and also sites that sell themes for a price. Most commercial themes are offered at two or three price points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first price is simply the cost of buying the theme for your own use, and can be anywhere from $20 to $100. Such a license allows you to use the theme on a single site.</li>
<li>The second price is the price you pay if you want to be able to use the theme on multiple sites (domains), or when you need the project graphics (for example, Photoshop documents) and other development files. In this case, it's usually from $60 to $200.</li>
<li>The last price point, although not that popular nowadays, is the <em>exclusive license</em>. You can get it if you want to be the only user of the theme. This can be anywhere from $500 to $1,500, or even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's focus on free versus paid themes for a minute. While every theme in the official directory is free, the rest of the internet is split in half on this. Some sites provide free themes exclusively, while others offer paid ones exclusively. There are also a number of distributors who sit in-between. I, personally, don't advise getting any free themes from anywhere other than either the official directory or one of the respected theme stores (which offer some free themes by way of a promotion).</p>
<p>The reason is simple. Only quality themes are allowed into the official directory, and I'm not just talking about the looks or the design. What matters, apart from the design, is also the code structure and code quality. There's no single theme that features any mysterious blocks of code (such as encrypted code or suspicious external links) that will ever find its way into the official directory. That's what ultimately makes the official directory one of the best sources of free WordPress themes on the web.</p>
<p>When it comes to various free themes being released in theme stores, the story is quite similar. The <em>first league</em> of WordPress themes, so to speak, consists of respected, serious companies. So, even when they release a free theme, they can't afford it being low quality or lacking in any other way. Therefore, in most cases, they are safe to use as well.</p>
<p>The last thing we can witness online are hundreds, if not thousands, of free themes being released on random websites, promoted through paid advertising, <em>top themes</em> lists, advertorial articles, and so on. Let me say this again: I don't advise you to get any of those, even if the designs are attractive. The fact is that you'll never know what sits on the inside and what security breaches can be taken advantage of to hack into such a theme. They are also almost never supported by their creators and there's no theme documentation or updates. In short, it is not worth it.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have some money you'd like to invest in your site and its quality, consider getting a full-blown premium theme, or even a premium theme framework. As I mentioned earlier, the price range is around $20 to $100, depending on the manufacturer and the features the theme comes with.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You are welcome to check out any theme provider you wish. But just to make things quicker, the following is my go-to-first list of quality theme stores:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ThemeIsle</strong>: <a href="https://themeisle.com/">https://themeisle.com/</a></li>
<li><strong>Elegant Themes</strong>: <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/">https://www.elegantthemes.com/</a></li>
<li><strong>ThemeForest</strong>: <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress">https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, here's a separate list of the top WordPress theme stores on the web, based on sales and product quality: <a href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/wordpress-theme-shop-directory-2016/">https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/wordpress-theme-shop-directory-2016/</a>.</p>
<p>In general, most good commercial theme websites let you see a preview of the theme in action before you buy it. Some also let you customize the theme before downloading it. As with any other online shopping experience, do some research before buying to make sure you'll be getting a quality theme with decent support. There are plenty of badly coded themes out there and even themes with malicious code. Before buying a theme, verify the source of the theme and see whether you can find feedback or reviews from anyone else who has purchased it.</p>
<p>To find even more websites that offer themes, just do a Google search for <kbd>WordPress themes</kbd> or <kbd>premium WordPress themes</kbd>, and you'll get over 100 million hits. Also, keep in mind that choosing a theme is not final. You can always review your decision later on and change the theme in a couple of clicks.</p>

<p>A WordPress theme is actually a collection of files in a directory. There are no special or unusual formats, just a few requirements for those files in the theme directory. The only requirements for a directory to be a valid WordPress theme are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should have a <kbd>style.css</kbd> file and an <kbd>index.php</kbd> file</li>
<li>The <kbd>style.css</kbd> file must have the basic theme information in its initial lines</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are a number of additional files that you'll find in most themes. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <kbd>screenshot.png</kbd> file that is the little thumbnail that shows what the theme looks like.</li>
<li>An <kbd>images</kbd> directory where all images associated with the theme reside.</li>
<li>A variety of files that are used for different purposes (for example, <kbd>functions.php</kbd>, <kbd>header.php</kbd>, <kbd>footer.php</kbd>, <kbd>page.php</kbd>, <kbd>single.php</kbd>, and <kbd>archive.php</kbd>). Read the following article to learn about the most commonly used files: <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Template_Files">https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Template_Files</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">To learn more about the structure of various theme files and their hierarchy, feel free to read the following articles at <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/">https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/</a> and <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/">https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/</a>.</div>
<p>You don't have to worry about these details now, but knowing them will help you identify what is going on inside the themes that you download. This will also be useful in the following chapters, where we will discuss making our own theme from scratch.</p>
<p>Also, don't worry if you download a theme and its directory structure looks very different from what's described here. Some theme developers decide to go with their own structure to provide some extra features and a more customizable environment. This is mostly the case with various theme frameworks and big premium themes that come with their pre-made child themes.</p>

<p>As you look through the themes that available out there, you'll see that there is quite a variety in terms of look, feel, and layout options. To be honest, picking the perfect theme involves effort and some thought. A couple of years ago, there were just a handful of quality websites and stores where you could get your hands on some themes. Now, there are hundreds to thousands of them. All of this results in a situation where there are multiple factors to consider when selecting a theme. It's best if you start with the following.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>As I've already mentioned multiple times in this chapter and the previous chapters, nowadays, WordPress is perfectly capable of running any kind of website, and this situation is reflected in the number of available themes. Therefore, the first question to answer is: <em>what do you need the theme for?</em></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Depending on the kind of site you're planning to launch, you should focus on different types of themes. The following are some of the popular possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional blogs</strong>: These are the ones where the content is presented in a reverse chronological order, with only several pages of static content.</li>
<li><strong>Photo blogs</strong>: These are very much like traditional blogs when it comes to content organization, but in this case, the content consists mainly of photos. This is a popular type of blog among photographers and other creative individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Video blogs</strong>: These are much like photo blogs, except now we're dealing with videos.</li>
<li><strong>Small business websites and corporate websites</strong>: Most small business sites don't feature a lot of <em>posts</em> like traditional blogs. They usually focus on static pages for providing the most important information about the business (such as contact data and offers). This type is most commonly used by local businesses such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, and other similar businesses. Corporate sites are very similar in nature, but are much bigger and feature much more content.</li>
<li><strong>One-page micro-websites</strong>: Some people know very well that they need only a minimal online presence, effectively treating their new website as a modern business card. In this case, a solution like a one-page site is perfect for them. In short, one-page sites are just what they sound like; they consist of only a single page. However, due to clever design and structure of that page, the visitor can still get a rich experience browsing it.</li>
<li><strong>Online magazines</strong>: The main difference between traditional blogs and online magazines is that the latter feature a lot more content, with usually as many as ten or more posts being published every day. This requires good content layout and clear presentation.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce stores</strong>: Traditionally known as online stores or shops, an e-commerce store is every website that offers a shopping cart functionality and allows its visitors to buy products, much like they'd do in a traditional store or supermarket.</li>
<li><strong>Software/app websites</strong>: These are websites that are devoted to promoting/selling a specific product. Nowadays, it's usually some kind of app or other piece of mobile software.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The trick when choosing a theme for your site is to understand its purpose and make your decision based not only on the appearance of the theme, but also on the thing you need the theme for, such as its capabilities, as well as options for further customization. The easiest way to do this is to pay attention to the categories of themes on the site where you're looking for them. For instance, if you go to one of the popular theme stores, such as the ones at <a href="https://themeisle.com/wordpress-themes/">https://themeisle.com/wordpress-themes/</a> or <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress">https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress</a>, you'll see that they feature mechanisms for filtering themes by purpose. Here's how ThemeForest does this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f5a3a34d-0661-4738-927f-23ff76276c6f.png" width="1069" height="560"/></p>
<p>You can also do some research on the internet and notice what the standard is when it comes to the themes being used in your niche and for your type of site. For example, if you're thinking of launching a photo blog, find out what sort of themes other photo blogs use—do they feature a lot of sidebars? How big are the photos they publish? Are there a lot of static pages? And so on. The idea is this: don't reinvent the wheel. If there's a significant number of sites that are similar to the one you're planning to launch, then you should always try learning from them and then making an educated decision when choosing your theme.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you're getting a theme from the official directory, then this part doesn't concern you.</p>
<p>However, when getting a theme from a professional theme store, you usually have two or more options regarding the license. As I mentioned earlier, the price range is usually between $20 to $100. Now, there are many licensing models, but the following two examples are the most popular web-wide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard, one-site license</strong>: This allows you to launch a site using the theme. It's the recommended choice if you're just searching for a theme for yourself and are not going to use it on other people's sites as well. This is the cheapest kind of license.</li>
<li><strong>Developer license</strong>: This is targeted toward developers and people who want to launch more than one site with a theme. Additionally, the package usually includes PSD project files and other mid-development files (note that some one-site licenses include those as well). Developer licenses can be as much as twice as expensive as standard, one-site licenses.</li>
</ul>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Up-to-date themes only</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is probably the most important parameter here. Your theme has to be up to date or it will fail to take advantage of the newest features in WordPress. The only bad news is that you can't know for sure whether a theme is a modern one or not. You can only rely on the details provided by the theme seller. But as bad as it sounds, it's actually not that big of a problem, because serious theme stores can't afford to lie in their marketing materials. So, whenever you see a message that the theme is <em>compatible with WordPress version X.X</em>, it's most likely true. Additionally, with WordPress 5 being released, and all the significant changes it brought to the table (compared to the previous versions), it's important to use only themes that have been verified to work with WordPress 5.</p>
<p>Also, a good rule of thumb is to check when the last update took place. Depending on the theme store you're getting the theme from, this information can be displayed in various places, so I can't give you any specific advice on where to look for it. Nevertheless, if you're getting your theme from the official directory at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a>, then you can find this detail in the right sidebar on every individual theme's page (labeled <span class="packt_screen">Last Updated</span>).</p>

<p>When considering a theme, make sure to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the sidebars flexible? Can I choose how many sidebars I want to display?</li>
<li>Is it widget-ready?</li>
<li>Does it support custom menus?</li>
<li>Does it work with the new WordPress block editor that got introduced in WordPress 5.0?</li>
<li>Is the theme complex or simple? Which do I prefer?</li>
<li>Does it support the Customizer panel? Or does it offer a <em>Theme Settings</em> page where I can customize the layout, category display, home page, and other options?</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point in WordPress' development, I recommend rejecting any theme that does not support widgets, custom menus, does not deliver good customization features, or doesn't seem to work well with the new WordPress block editor. The idea behind all of this is that, these days, a situation where you can use a theme right out of the box rarely happens, so having at least a couple of customization possibilities goes a very long way.</p>

<p>This is one of the new parameters among modern themes. Back in the day, if you wanted to make your site mobile-friendly, you needed to get some plugins and additional mobile themes and then enable them to work at the same time. Now, with HTML5 and CSS3, you can use just one theme and be certain that it's going to look great on every possible device (from desktop computers to laptops, and mobile devices). The keyword to all this is <em>responsive design/structure.</em></p>
<p>Whenever a theme developer indicates that their theme is responsive, it means that it's compatible with all the devices people use to access the internet these days. In a nutshell, whenever a theme is responsive, this fact will surely be mentioned on the official sales/download page.</p>

<p>This is especially important if you're getting a paid premium theme. Quite simply, since you're paying money, you naturally want to be sure that the product you're getting is a quality one that provides good customer service and well-designed functionality, hence the importance of documentation, reviews, and customer support. It's a simple as that.</p>
<p>I do admit that selecting a theme can take a while, especially if you have to remember all of what we've just covered, but this is work that will surely pay off. Let's not forget that you're probably going to use that theme for at least a year or two (a common scenario), so you surely don't want to spend money on a low-quality product.</p>

<p>Now that you've chosen the theme you want to use, you'll need to install it onto your WordPress website. You'll have the following two choices, as you did when adding new plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the theme you want is in the WordPress <span class="packt_screen">Theme Directory</span>, you can add the theme straight from within <kbd>wp-admin</kbd></li>
<li>Otherwise, you'll have to download the theme's ZIP archive and then upload it to your site by hand</li>

<p>As we mentioned in the preceding section, you can add a theme directly from within your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> if you've chosen a theme from the WordPress <span class="packt_screen">Theme Directory</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span>, and then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> button (visible at the top), as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b913bdca-8b85-4bfa-9700-bdcf0d2051fa.png" style="width:40.25em;height:20.83em;" width="1071" height="554"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The screen that's going to appear will be very similar to the <span class="packt_screen">Add New Plugins</span> screen. At the top, you'll see some familiar elements, such as various sub-navigation links (<span class="packt_screen">Featured</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Popular</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Latest</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Favorites</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Feature Filter</span>), along with a search box to the right. You can click on any theme displayed on the grid to see its details, along with a nice preview.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Using <span class="packt_screen">Feature Filter</span> (as shown in the following screenshot), you can filter out some of the themes based on the functionality they have or don't have. The <span class="packt_screen">Feature Filter</span> is a great way to find a theme that offers a specific range of functionalities that you require for the site you're currently building. For instance, you can choose to display themes featuring a responsive layout only. This will make sure that your website is going to look great on all devices, and that's including all desktop computers, as well as mobiles and tablets:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/8d05c231-2021-426a-b3d1-88e012f54b29.png" style="width:37.67em;height:38.33em;" width="870" height="885"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now, I've already found a theme I like, so I won't bother with filtering and just put the name of the theme in the search box, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5aacb1cb-d373-4b33-a22c-4bf8c77731dc.png" style="width:34.00em;height:21.25em;" width="1001" height="625"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>When I hover over the theme block, I will see additional links for details, preview, and installation. Clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Preview</span> is a great way to see what the theme is most likely going to look like in action. When I click on <span class="packt_screen">Install</span>, the theme will be downloaded and added to my collection of themes automatically (and will be visible in the <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> section in<kbd>wp-admin</kbd>), as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/470d639d-1303-4316-939e-1ff1a80f6607.png" style="width:44.25em;height:17.67em;" width="1818" height="727"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="5">
<li>By clicking on the theme, I will see a larger block containing all the details, along with two more links to activate and see the live preview of the theme, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/14904230-8e9e-4ed1-8ae9-3bc85df7e33d.png" width="1498" height="835"/></p>
<p>At this point, clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Activate</span> button will result in <em>turning the theme on</em> and setting it as the new design on the website - instead of <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span> (which is the default, out-of-the-box theme when you first install WordPress).</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you can't install a theme from within <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> for whatever reason, you'll have to use the following procedure instead.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to the growing popularity of external theme sources, such as various theme stores and independent developers, downloading and installing a theme manually becomes the default way of handling things, and gradually replaces the traditional approach of getting a theme from the official directory.</p>
<p>Therefore, to provide a good example when explaining the manual installation, I'm going to get a theme (a free one) and guide you through the process of having it installed:</p>
<ol>
<li>To get started, what you need is to download your desired theme and save its ZIP archive somewhere on your desktop. Don't extract the archive. The theme I'd like to try out is called <em>Underscores</em>, and it's a free starter theme that's available at <a href="https://underscores.me/">https://underscores.me/</a>.</li>
<li>Depending on the source of your theme, in order to actually get it, you might be required to either create a user account, make a purchase, or sign up for a newsletter, and so on. Of course, sometimes, there's just a direct download link. Underscores uses a pretty straightforward model. All you need to do is input the name that you want to use for your theme in the field at <a href="https://underscores.me/">https://underscores.me/</a> (it can be whatever name you wish). Then, after clicking on <span class="packt_screen">GENERATE</span>, you'll get a ZIP download:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/caa4dd6a-96b5-4136-9671-efa6e91ddfcd.png" width="1222" height="608"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>At this point, you can upload that ZIP file through <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> by navigating to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance | Themes</span> and clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> button. There, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Upload Theme</span> button, which will take you to the place where you can finally perform the manual installation, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f028e340-b68f-4a04-8776-3d2b0ec4560f.png" style="width:36.92em;height:13.17em;" width="774" height="276"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The only thing you need to do there is choose the ZIP file from your desktop and then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Install Now</span> button. After a short while, you will be redirected to the success page, where you will be able to activate your new theme.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If this doesn't work, continue with the following steps to extract and upload the theme files manually.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>If you're on Mac, the ZIP file may have automatically been unzipped for you, in which case you'll see a directory on your desktop instead of the ZIP file, or in addition to the ZIP file. If not, then just do the extraction/unzipping manually so that you have the theme directory on your desktop.</li>
<li>The following screenshot shows the file contents of the Underscores theme that I downloaded. Apart from the mandatory <kbd>style.css</kbd> file and the <kbd>index.php</kbd> file, it also has a number of other files that handle different tasks and take care of various aspects of the display and the functionality of the theme:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/934213e2-b48a-4ec1-b9ba-e2cf8b77b042.png" width="1004" height="324"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="7">
<li>You need to upload the theme directory to your WordPress website. As you did in <a href="2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Getting Started with WordPress</em>, you need to start an FTP connection with your server. Once there, navigate to your WordPress website's installation directory.</li>
<li>Next, go to the <kbd>wp-content</kbd> directory and then to the <kbd>themes</kbd> directory. You'll see one theme directory in here already named <kbd>twentynineteen</kbd> (and possibly others as well). These are the themes that came pre-installed with WordPress. The only thing you have to do here is upload the directory that you've just unzipped a minute ago so that it sits alongside the default <kbd>twentynineteen</kbd> directory. And that's it!</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, when you go back to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> in your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, you will see the new theme waiting there. All that's left to do now is activate it and use it as the main design of your site.</p>
