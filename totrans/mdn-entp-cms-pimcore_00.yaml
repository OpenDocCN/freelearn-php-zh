- en: Nowadays, digital innovation is a challenge for any medium-sized or large organization.
    This journey, also known as *digital transformation*, is not only related to technology
    but is guided by cultural and motivational pillars. Many managers or communication
    gurus will tell you that technology is not important and that it's just a commodity
    or a set of tools at the service of the company (marketing, sales, and suchlike).
    We believe that this approach is possible only if the technology you have chosen
    is genuinely able to support your business initiatives. In terms of starting to
    forget about technical issues and focusing on business only, we have to find a
    technical solution that works perfectly under all conditions that can scale and
    support the business as it grows. Following an extended period of research, we
    have found that this solution is called Pimcore.

    operative friction between the mind and the hands of a company. Pimcore can act
    as a **PIM (Product Information Management**) system for distributing product
    information across the entire company or centralize essential data for the company
    (Master Data Management), allowing all other parties to consume it without any
    security risk.

    web pages. It is a very versatile solution that covers most of the problems you
    encounter every day. In this book, we will learn how to get the best out of Pimcore.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed to encourage you to learn about Pimcore in a straightforward
    manner. We will cover all the important topics to enable you to initiate and complete
    a real-world project. To reach this goal, we have developed a book that's not
    only a set of information but something that combines theory and practice. This
    pragmatic approach will teach you how Pimcore works and how to put your knowledge
    into practice without getting annoyed or barely being able to follow tutorials
    by asking you why you need to do that. In fact, the first chapters will introduce
    you to a high-level vision of Pimcore so that you are aware of all of its benefits,
    and then we will embark on a journey that will progressively uncover all the details
    of Pimcore step by step without introducing any excessive complexity.
