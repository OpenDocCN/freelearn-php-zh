- en: A couple of years ago I was introduced to Zend Framework 1 by a friend of mine,
    and since then I have been a fan. Although the first framework was a real bulky
    framework with not much documentation, I feel that the second version of the framework
    improved greatly. The incredible toolshed full of features, makes this framework
    (personally) one of the best frameworks to work in.

- en: But as we all probably know, because of its incredibly vast library of features
    the learning curve can appear very steep. That is why I felt the need to write
    about all the important parts of the framework, in bite-size pieces that don't
    overwhelm someone (you in this case) who wants to learn it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow the book in the best possible way I would recommend using a Linux-based
    web server, as most of the recipes are more Linux oriented than Windows. If you
    are a Windows user you'll probably be better off installing a virtual machine
    with Linux on it, or installing a Zend Server community edition to make sure your
    machine is compatible for Zend Framework 2 development (you can also do this without
    Zend Server, but it is just more convenient).

- en: '*Zend Framework 2 Cookbook* is for PHP developers who are fairly advanced in
    PHP programming. It will also be useful for developers who have a keen interest
    in expanding their knowledge outside the boundaries of simply scripting pages
    together. As unit testing and MVC will be discussed, it is beneficial for the
    reader to know what these technologies are, although experience with developing
    applications is not necessarily essential.'
