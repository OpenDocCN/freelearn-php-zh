			<p>In this book, you learn much more than simply how to set up resources and activities. You learn how to select the resources and activities that are the best fit for your course goals, the unique needs of the learners, and a unique blend of on-demand, "live," or blended delivery. </p>
			<p>At each step, we use solid instructional design principles to guide along the way and create an ideal blend of interaction, engaging course content, and activities to help students review their knowledge and then demonstrate their knowledge and skills. </p>
			<p>After you have completed Part 2, you will be able to use your course design plan to build courses that incorporate Moodle's activities and resources as well as the new functionality of Moodle 4.0. You will be able to use the flexibility of Moodle to incorporate content that engages students, accommodates all kinds of learners, and allows multiple methods of delivery. You'll also be able to add activities that keep your students engaged and on tasks. In addition, you'll find ways for students to interact with each other and collaborate. Finally, you'll be able to develop a wide array of assessments that help assure that students can demonstrate achievement of learning objectives and course goals. </p>
			<p>In this part, we cover the following chapters:</p>
