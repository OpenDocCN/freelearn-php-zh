<p>For those who have used Drupal previously, Views is in core for Drupal 8. If you are new to Drupal, note that Views has been one of the most used contributed projects for Drupal 6 and Drupal 7.</p>
<p>Briefly described, Views is a visual query builder that allows you to pull content from the database and render it in multiple formats. Select administrative areas and content listings provided out of the box by Drupal are all powered by Views. We'll dive into how to use Views to customize the administrative interface, customize ways to display your content, and interact with the entity reference field.</p>

<p>Views does one thing, and it does it well--listing content. The power behind the Views module is the amount of configurable power it gives the end user to display content in various forms.</p>
<p>This recipe will cover creating a content listing and linking it in the main menu. We will use the <kbd>Article</kbd> content type provided by the standard installation and make an article's landing page.</p>

<p>Let's list the Views listing content:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Structure</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">Views</span>, as shown in the following screenshot; this will bring you to the administrative overview of all the views that have been created:</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Add view</span> to create a new view.</li>
<li>The first step is to provide the <span class="packt_screen">View name</span> of articles, which will serve as the administrative and (by default) displayed title.</li>
<li>Next, we will modify the <span class="packt_screen">VIEW SETTINGS</span>. We want to display <span class="packt_screen">Content</span> of the type <kbd>Article</kbd> and leave the <span class="packt_screen">tagged with</span> field empty. This will force the view to only show content of the <kbd>Article</kbd> content type.</li>
<li>Check the <span class="packt_screen">Create a page</span> option. The <span class="packt_screen">Page title</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Path</span> will be autopopulated based on the view name and can be modified as desired. For now, leave the display and other settings at their default values:</li>

<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Save and edit</span> to continue modifying your new view.</li>
<li>In the middle column, under the <span class="packt_screen">PAGE SETTINGS</span> section, we will change the <span class="packt_screen">Menu item</span> settings. Click on <span class="packt_screen">No menu</span> to change the default.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Normal menu entry</span>. Provide a menu link title and an optional description. Set <span class="packt_screen">Parent</span> to <span class="packt_screen">&lt;Main Navigation&gt;</span>:</li>
</ol>

<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Apply</span> at the bottom of the form.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> to save your view.</li>
<li>Once your view is saved, click on <span class="packt_screen">Back to site</span> from the administrative menu. You will now see the link in your Drupal site's main menu.</li>

<p>The first step to create a view involves selecting the type of data you will be displaying. This is referred to as the base table, which can be any type of entity or data specifically exposed to Views.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Nodes are labeled as <strong>Content</strong> in Views, and you will find <span>this interchanged terminology</span> throughout Drupal.</div>
<p>When creating a Views page, we add a menu path that can be accessed. It tells Drupal to invoke Views to render the page, which will load the view you create and render it.</p>
<p>There are display <kbd>style</kbd> and <kbd>row</kbd> plugins that format the data to be rendered. Our recipe used the unformatted list style to wrap each row in a simple <kbd>div</kbd> element. We could have changed this to a table for a formatted list. The row display controls how each row is outputted.</p>

<p>The Views module has been one of the must-use modules since it first debuted, to the point that almost every Drupal 7 site used this module. In the following section, we will dive further into Views.</p>

<p>The Views module has been a contributed module up until Drupal 8. In fact, it was one of the most used modules. Although the module is now part of Drupal core, it still has many improvements that are needed, and are being committed.</p>
<p>Through their 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 <span>releases</span>, there have been many improvements. We will continue to see this pattern with each future minor release.</p>

<p>When working with Views, you will see some different terminologies. One of the key items to be grasped is what a display is. A view can contain multiple displays. Each display is of a certain type. Views comes with the following display types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attachment</strong>: This is a display that becomes attached to another display in the same view</li>
<li><strong>Block</strong>: This allows you to place the view as a block</li>
<li><strong>Embed</strong>: The display is meant to be embedded programmatically</li>
<li><strong>Entity Reference</strong>: This allows Views to provide results for an entity reference field</li>
<li><strong>Feed</strong>: This display returns a XML-based feed and can be attached to another display to render a feed icon</li>
<li><strong>Page</strong>: This allows you to display the view from a specific route</li>
</ul>
<p>Each display can have its own configuration, too. However, each display will share the same base table (content, files, and so on). This allows you to take the same data and represent it in different ways.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Within Views, there are two types of style plugins that represent how your data is displayed: style and row:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>style</strong> plugin represents the overall format</li>
<li>The <strong>row</strong> plugin represents each result row's format</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the <kbd>grid</kbd> style will output multiple <kbd>div</kbd> elements with specified classes to create a responsive <kbd>grid</kbd>. At the same time, the <kbd>table</kbd> style creates a tabular output with labels used as table headings.</p>
<p>Row plugins define how to render the row. The default content will render the entity as defined by its selected display mode. If you choose <span class="packt_screen">Fields</span>, you can manually select which fields to include in your view.</p>
<p>Each format style plugin has a corresponding <kbd>Twig</kbd> file that the theme layer uses. Refer to the <span><em>Twig templating</em> recipe of</span> <a href="991ad206-3a73-4c3a-b6b7-c680a0a74a53.xhtml"><em>Chapter 5</em></a>, <em>Frontend for the Win</em> to learn more about Twig in Drupal 8.</p>
<p>You can define new plugins in custom modules or use contributed modules to access different options.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using the Embed display</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Each of the available display types has a method to expose itself through the user interface, except for Embed. Often, contributed and custom modules use Views to render displays instead of manually writing queries and rendering the output. Drupal 8 provides a special display type to simplify this.</p>
<p>If we were to add an Embed display to the view created in the recipe, we could pass the following render array to output our view programmatically:</p>
<pre>$view_render = [ 
  '#type' =&gt; 'view', 
  '#name' =&gt; 'articles', 
  '#display_id' =&gt; 'embed_1', 
]; </pre>
<p>When rendered, the <kbd>#type</kbd> key tells Drupal that this is a view element. We then point it to our new display <kbd>embed_1</kbd>. The Embed display type has no special functionality, in fact, it is a simplistic display plugin. The benefit is that it does not have additional operations conducted for the sake of performance.</p>
<p>Using an Embed display is beneficial when you want to use a View in a custom page, block, or even form. For example, Drupal Commerce uses this pattern for its shopping cart block and the order summary in the checkout. A view is used to display the order information within a custom block and form.</p>

<p>With the addition of Views in Drupal core, many of the administrative interfaces are powered by Views. This allows customization of default admin interfaces to enhance site management and content authoring experiences.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">In Drupal 6 and 7, there was the Administrative Views contributed module, which provided a way to override administrative pages with Views. This module is no longer required, as the functionality comes with Drupal core out of the box.</div>
<p>In this recipe, we will modify the default content overview form that is used to find and edit content. We will add the ability to filter content by the user who authored it.</p>

<p>When a view is created that has a path matching an existing route, it will override it and present itself. That is how the <kbd>/admin/content</kbd> and other administrative pages are able to be powered by Views.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you were to disable the Views module, you can still manage content and users. The default forms are tables that do not provide filters or other extra features.</div>
<p>Drupal uses the overridden route and uses Views to render the page. From that point on, the page is handled like any other Views page would be rendered.</p>

<p>Filters allow you to narrow the scope of the data displayed in a view. Filters can either be exposed or not; by default, a filter is not exposed. An example would be using the <span class="packt_screen">Content: Publishing status</span> set to <span class="packt_screen">Yes (published)</span> to ensure that a view always contains published content. This is an item you would configure to display content to site visitors. However, if it were for an administrative display, you may want to expose that filter. This way, content editors can view, easily, what content has not been published yet or been unpublished.</p>
<p>All filter and sort criteria can be marked as exposed.</p>

<p>Exposed filters work by parsing query parameters in the URL. For instance, on the content management form, changing the <kbd>Type</kbd> filter will add <kbd>type=Article</kbd>, among others to the current URL.</p>
<p>With this recipe, the author filter would show up as <span class="packt_screen">uid</span> in the URL. Exposed filters have a<br/>
<span class="packt_screen">Filter identifier</span> option that can change the URL component:</p>

<p>This could be changed to <kbd>author</kbd> or some other value to enhance the user experience behind the URL, or mask the Drupal-ness of it.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Views can replace administrative pages with enhanced versions due to the way the route and module system works in Drupal. Modules are executed in order of the module's weight or alphabetical order if weights are the same. Naturally, in the English alphabet, the letter <em>V</em> comes toward the end of the alphabet. That means any route that Views provides will be added toward the end of the route discovery cycle.</p>
<p>If a view is created and it provides a route path, it will override any that exist on that path. There is no collision checking mechanism (and there was not one present in Views before merging into Drupal core) that prevents this.</p>
<p>This allows you to easily customize most existing routes, but, beware that you could easily have conflicting routes, and Views will normally override the other.</p>

<p>Previous recipes have shown how to create and manipulate a page created by a view. Views provides different display types that can be created, such as a block. In this recipe, we will create a block powered by Views. The Views block will list all Tag taxonomy terms that have been added to the <kbd>Article</kbd> content type.</p>

<p>In the Drupal 8 plugin system, there is a concept called Derivatives. Plugins are small pieces of swappable functionality within Drupal 8. Plugins and plugin development are covered in <span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="3994173f-3d31-4f01-b808-99e01368564b.xhtml"><em>Chapter 7</em></a>, <em>Plug and Play with Plugins</em></span>. A derivative allows a module to present multiple variations of a plugin dynamically. In the case of Views, it allows the module to provide variations of a <kbd>ViewsBlock</kbd> plugin for each view that has a block display. Views implements the <kbd>\Drupal\views\Plugin\Block\ViewsBlock\ViewsBlock</kbd> class, providing the base for the dynamic availability of these blocks. Each derived block is an instance of this class.</p>
<p>When Drupal initiates the block, Views passes the proper configuration required. The view is then executed and the display is rendered whenever the block is displayed.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>If your view utilizes exposed filters, you have the option to place the exposed form in a block. With this option enabled, you may place the block anywhere on the page, even pages not for your view.</p>
<p>An example of using an exposed form in a block is for a search result view. You will add an exposed filter for keywords that control the search results. With the exposed filters in a block, you can easily place it in your site's header. When an exposed filter block is submitted, it will direct users to your view's display.</p>
<p>To enable the exposed filters as a block, you must first expand the <span class="packt_screen">Advanced</span> section on the right side of the Views edit form. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Exposed form in block</span> option from the <span class="packt_screen">Advanced</span> section. In the options modal that opens, select the <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> radio button, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Apply</span>. You can <span>then</span> place the block from the <span class="packt_screen">Block layout</span> form:</p>

<p>Views can be configured to accept <strong>contextual filters</strong>. Contextual filters allow you to provide a dynamic argument that modifies the view's output. The value is expected to be passed from the URL; however, if it is not present, there are ways to provide a default value.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will create a new page called <kbd>My Content</kbd>, which will display a user's authored content on the <kbd>/user/%/content</kbd> <span>route.</span></p>

<p>Contextual filters mimic the route variables found in the Drupal routing system. Variables are represented by percentage signs as placeholders in the view's path. Views will match up each placeholder with contextual filters by order of their placement. This allows you to have multiple contextual filters; you just need to ensure that they are ordered properly.</p>
<p>The Views module is aware of how to handle the placeholder because the type of data is selected when you add the filter. Once the contextual filter is added, there are extra options available for handling the route variable.</p>

<p>You are still able to preview a view from the edit form. You simply add the contextual filter values to the text form concatenated by a forward slash (<kbd>/</kbd>). In this recipe, you could<br/>
replace navigating to <kbd>/user/1/content</kbd> with simply inputting <kbd>1</kbd> into the preview form and updating the preview.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Contextual filters can have validation attached. Without specifying extra validation, Views will take the expected argument and try to make it <em>just work</em>. You can add validation to help limit this scope and filter out invalid route variables.</p>
<p>You can enable validation by checking <span class="packt_screen">Specify validation criteria</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">When the filter value is present in the URL or a default is provided</span> section. The default is set to <span class="packt_screen">Basic Validation</span>, which allows you to specify how the view should react if the data is invalid; based on our recipe, this would be if the user is not found.</p>
<p>The list of <span class="packt_screen">Validator</span> options is not filtered by the contextual filter item you selected, so some may not apply. For our recipe, one might want <span class="packt_screen">User ID</span> and select the <span class="packt_screen">Validate user has access to the <em>User</em></span>. This validator would make sure that the current user is able to view the route's user's profile. Additionally, it can be restricted further based on its role:</p>

<p>This gives you more granular control over how the view operates when using contextual filters for route arguments.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>You may also configure the contextual filter to allow <kbd>AND</kbd> or <kbd>OR</kbd> operations along with exclusion. These options are under the <span class="packt_screen">More</span> section when adding or editing a contextual filter.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Allow multiple values</span> option can be checked to enable <kbd>AND</kbd> or <kbd>OR</kbd> operations. If the contextual filter argument contains a series of values concatenated by plus (<kbd>+</kbd>) signs, it acts as an <kbd>OR</kbd> operation. If the values are concatenated by commas (<kbd>,</kbd>) it acts as an <kbd>AND</kbd> operation.</p>
<p>When the <span class="packt_screen">Exclude</span> option is checked, the value will be excluded from the results rather than the view being limited by it.</p>

<p>As stated at the beginning of the chapter, Views is a visual query builder. When you first create a view, a base table is specified from which to pull data. Views automatically knows how to join tables for field data, such as body text or custom-attached fields.</p>
<p>When using an entity reference field, you can display the value as the raw identifier, the referenced entity's label, or the entire rendered entity. However, if you add a relationship based on a reference field, you will have access to display any of that entity's available fields.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will update the Files view, used for administering files, to display the username of the user who uploaded the file.</p>

<p>Drupal stores data in a normalized format. Database normalization, in short, involves the organization of data in specifically related tables. Each entity type has its own database table, and all fields have their own database table. When you create a view and specify what kind of data will be shown, you are specifying a base table in the database that Views will query. Views will automatically associate fields that belong to the entity and it's relationship to those tables for you.</p>
<p>When an entity has an entity reference field, you can add a relationship to the referenced entity type's table. This is an explicit definition, whereas fields are implicit. When the relationship is explicitly defined, all the referenced entity type's fields come into scope. The fields on the referenced entity type can then be displayed, filtered, and sorted.</p>

<p>Using relationships in Views allows you to create some powerful displays. We will discuss aggregation and additional information about relationships.</p>

<p>The Views module uses a series of hooks to retrieve data that it then uses to represent ways to interact with the database. One of these is the <kbd>hook_field_views_data</kbd> hook, which processes a field storage configuration entity and registers its data with Views. The Views module implements this on behalf of the Drupal core to add relationships and reverse relationship, for Entity reference fields.</p>
<p>Since Entity reference fields have set schema information, Views can dynamically generate these relationships by understanding the field's table name, destination entity's table name, and the destination entity's identifier column.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Relationships provided through custom code</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are times where you will need to define a relation on your own with custom code. Typically, when working with custom data in Drupal, you would more than likely create a new entity type; this topic is covered in <a href="b2659986-a8dc-4503-a043-6071ab7b6722.xhtml"><em><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 9</span></em></a>, <em>Configuration Management - Deploying in Drupal 8</em>. This is not always the case, however, and you may just need a simple method of storing data. An example can be found in the Database Logging module. The Database Logging module defines a schema for a database table and then uses <kbd>hook_views_data</kbd> to expose its database table to Views.</p>
<p>The <kbd>dblog_schema</kbd> hook implementation returns a <kbd>uid</kbd> column on the watchdog database table created by the module. That column is then exposed to Views using the following definition:</p>
<pre>  $data['watchdog']['uid'] = array( 
    'title' =&gt; t('UID'), 
    'help' =&gt; t('The user ID of the user on which the log entry <br/>       was written..'), 
    'field' =&gt; array( 
      'id' =&gt; 'numeric', 
    ), 
    'filter' =&gt; array( 
      'id' =&gt; 'numeric', 
    ), 
    'argument' =&gt; array( 
      'id' =&gt; 'numeric', 
    ), 
    'relationship' =&gt; array( 
      'title' =&gt; t('User'), 
      'help' =&gt; t('The user on which the log entry as written.'), 
      'base' =&gt; 'users', 
      'base field' =&gt; 'uid', 
      'id' =&gt; 'standard', 
    ), 
  ); </pre>
<p>This array tells Views that the <kbd>watchdog</kbd> table has a column named <kbd>uid</kbd>. It is numeric in nature for its display, filtering capabilities, and sorting capabilities. The <kbd>relationship</kbd><br/>
key is an array of information that instructs Views how to use this to provide a relationship (<kbd>LEFT JOIN</kbd>) on the <kbd>users</kbd> table. The <kbd>User</kbd> entity uses the <kbd>users</kbd> table and has the primary key of <kbd>uid</kbd>.</p>

<p>There is a view setting under the <span class="packt_screen">Advanced</span> section that allows you to enable aggregation.<br/>
This feature allows you to enable the usage of SQL aggregate functions, such as <kbd>MIN</kbd>, <kbd>MAX</kbd>, <kbd>SUM</kbd>, <kbd>AVG</kbd>, and <kbd>COUNT</kbd>. In this recipe, the Files view uses aggregation to sum the usage counts of each file on the Drupal site.</p>
<p>Aggregation settings are set for each field, and when enabled, they have their own link to configure these settings:</p>

<p>The Entity reference field, covered in <a href="953ad256-0342-45c8-84d9-5cda80d2d099.xhtml"><em><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 2</span></em></a>, <em>The Content Authoring Experience</em>, can utilize a custom view for providing the available field values. The default entity reference field will display all available entities of the type it can reference. The only available filter is based on the entity bundle, such as only returning <kbd>Article</kbd> nodes. Using an entity reference view, you can provide more filters, such as only returning the content that your user has authored.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will create an entity reference view that filters content by the author. We will add the field to the user account form, allowing users to select their favorite contributed content.</p>

<p>The entity reference field definition provides selection plugins. The Views module provides an entity reference selection plugin. This allows entity reference to gather data into a view to receive available results.</p>
<p>The display type for Views requires you to select which fields will be used to search against when using the autocomplete widget. If you are not using the autocomplete widget and instead use the select list or checkboxes and radio buttons, then it will return the view's entire results.</p>
