This allows add-on developers to earn some money with the packages that they create for concrete5, and it also supports the concrete5 team, as concrete5 gets a percentage of each add-on that is sold.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4548OS_AppC_02.jpg" alt="Submitting an Add-on Package to the concrete5 Marketplace"/></div><div class="section" title="The rules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec175"/>The rules</h1></div></div></div><p>There are several rules that your add-on must adhere to. First and foremost, your add-on must work. There shouldn't be any <a id="id692" class="indexterm"/>errors while installing the add-on or while using it. Also, make sure that you own the rights to all of the code and assets contained within the add-on, or you have <a id="id693" class="indexterm"/>received proper permission <a id="id694" class="indexterm"/>from the code authors to include their code in your add-on.</p><p>Some other rules include using <code class="literal">defined or die</code> statements at the top of every PHP file, including an icon, and making sure to wrap all strings in the global <code class="literal">t()</code> function. Add-on developers are also expected to support their add-on and release updates to fix bugs and address customer complaints.</p><p>There are many more tips and rules posted on the concrete5 website at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.concrete5.org/developers/marketplace-submission-rules/">http://www.concrete5.org/developers/marketplace-submission-rules/</a>.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The process"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec176"/>The process</h1></div></div></div><p>When submitting a package to the <a id="id695" class="indexterm"/>concrete5 marketplace, first you will need an <a id="id696" class="indexterm"/>account on <a class="ulink" href="http://www.concrete5.org">www.concrete5.org</a>. Once you have <a id="id697" class="indexterm"/>created an account, you will have to fill out a form (located at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/manage_item/">http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/manage_item/</a>) containing information about your package:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4548OS_AppC_01.jpg" alt="The process"/></div><p>You will fill out all of the marketing copies that will appear in the marketplace listing, as well as some internal meta data about your add-on.</p><p>Once you have submitted the add-on, some <a id="id698" class="indexterm"/>automated tests will be performed on it to see if it meets the eligibility requirements. Once the add-on passes these tests, members of the <span class="strong"><strong>Peer Review Board</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PRB</strong></span>) will take a look at your add-on.</p><div class="section" title="The Peer Review Board"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec583"/>The Peer Review Board</h2></div></div></div><p>The PRB is a group of volunteers <a id="id699" class="indexterm"/>from the concrete5 community. These volunteers are responsible for testing every add-on and theme that is submitted to the marketplace. They will install your package on their own version of concrete5 and test it fully to make sure it will work <a id="id700" class="indexterm"/>without difficulties, and to ensure that your add-on adheres to the rules.</p></div><div class="section" title="Selling your add-on"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec584"/>Selling your add-on</h2></div></div></div><p>concrete5 allows developers to sell their <a id="id701" class="indexterm"/>add-on. The lowest price you can set for an add-on (other than free) is $15 USD. concrete5 will keep 25 percent of your add-on's revenue, but the exposure they provide to your add-on by featuring it in the marketplace is usually worth a small commission.</p><p>If you sell an add-on in the concrete5 marketplace, you will be expected to support it. If your add-on doesn't work and you do not provide support for it, concrete5 will refund the customer and also charge you a 15 percent penalty. Make sure you are prepared to invest the time in supporting your add-ons.</p></div><div class="section" title="Once the add-on is approved..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec585"/>Once the add-on is approved...</h2></div></div></div><p>If your add-on passes the review <a id="id702" class="indexterm"/>board and is approved, it will be listed as available in the concrete5 marketplace. Be sure to pay attention to customer inquiries or support requests. Also, if you are selling your add-on, remember to request payments for downloads on a regular basis.</p></div></div>
