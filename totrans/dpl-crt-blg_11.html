By the end of this appendix your site will be live, and only a few minor deployment issues now stand in between you and your online aspirations.<span class="emphasis"><em> Actually that's not quite true!</em></span> I should make it clear that there's nothing particularly complex about deployment; it's just that you need to keep on top of a lot of different issues. Making silly errors at this stage can have dramatic effects on the final product because we are dealing mainly with configuration issues when we deploy a fully developed application. Of course, making errors is not the end of the world, because we are going to test everything very thoroughly.</p><p>At first glance, deploying a site like Drupal has got to be pretty easy—it's just a case of copying the<code class="literal"> drupal</code> folder over to the new server!<span class="emphasis"><em> Or is it?</em></span> There are a number of concerns that go hand in hand with ensuring everything goes smoothly during the transfer. For example, the database will also have to be rebuilt exactly as it is on the development machine—I'm sure that since most of you have spent some time configuring everything and populating tables, you'll be anxious to not have to do everything all over again. Apart from this, there are the connection parameters and some security issues to think about.<a class="indexterm" id="id412"/>
</p><p>Specifically, the appendix looks at how to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Get everything ready for deployment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Transfer the files to their new home</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Set up the site, including the database</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Test everything thoroughly</li></ul></div><p>Chins up, we're nearly at the end; and it hasn't been all that bad, has it? I for one will no doubt start my very own blog—it's really tempting!</p><div class="section" title="Getting Ready to Deploy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec07"/>Getting Ready to Deploy</h1></div></div></div><p>First thing's first;<span class="emphasis"><em> are you sure you are completely happy with the site as it is?</em></span> While it is not a huge problem to make modifications to your site after deployment, there is no point in making things hard for yourself by having to recode some pages or make design changes then, when you can get them done now. If everything is in order, then we can begin with the preparation process.</p><p>Preparation comes in three stages. In no particular order, we need to ensure that we have a nice, clean, working version of the site, a nice, clean, working copy of the database, and finally, a nice, clean file system ready for the files on the host site. Let's take a look at how this is done.<a class="indexterm" id="id413"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Make Sure the Host Is Ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec08"/>Make Sure the Host Is Ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Intuitively enough, you have to make sure you have an adequate host. By this I mean you have a host on which you can<span class="emphasis"><em> create a MySQL database</em></span>, and that allows<span class="emphasis"><em> access to a file system</em></span>, and whatever other goodies you think you may need. To make your life easy, it is also nice to have an FTP account available so that you can transfer files across to the host file system. More often than not, you should be able to log on to your FTP account with your administrator's username and password automatically. If you're not sure what all this is about, then try the following URL in your browser (assuming your browser supports FTP):<a class="indexterm" id="id414"/>
</p><p>
<code class="literal">ftp://ftp.your_domain_name.com</code>
</p><p>If you are prompted for a password or are shown the contents of your home directory, then congratulations, you have an FTP account. If you don't have one, then you should consider getting your host to give you one, or finding out from them how they upload files. Incidentally, instead of being prompted for your username and password every time you use your FTP account, you might want to send them in the URL, like so:</p><p>
<code class="literal">ftp://username:password@hostname/</code>
</p><p>If you're worried about security (by this I mean: you<span class="emphasis"><em> are</em></span> worried about security), then it's best to leave out the password and simply pass the username, because otherwise this can cause security problems if URLs are logged in a non-secure place. Remember that this information is already being passed in an unencrypted format. If you wish to do everything securely, you should speak to your host about how to secure file transfers.</p><p>If you don't have access to an FTP account, then don't panic! Read the section entitled<span class="emphasis"><em> Transfer the Files</em></span> a little later on in this appendix—it will still be easy to move your files to the host site.</p><p>Once you have made sure that there is somewhere to upload the Drupal files to, and something to do it with, you need to create a database. Goodness only knows how many different ways this can be done in; so we won't go into each and every one here.<a class="indexterm" id="id415"/>
</p><p>Take a look at your site's administrative interface and see if there is a section that allows you to create and control your MySQL database (you might find that your host provides our good friend phpMyAdmin). For example, the demo site's host has the following<span class="strong"><strong> Manage Mysql</strong></span> link in the<span class="strong"><strong> Databases</strong></span> section that provides an interface used to create databases. It also provides phpMyAdmin in order to administer those databases:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Make Sure the Host Is Ready" src="graphics/1800_0A_01.jpg"/></div><p>Clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> Manage MySQL</strong></span> link brings up the following page. Once you have the database, ensure that you have made note of its name—often hosts will append something to the name you choose as shown here in the demo site's database creation interface:<a class="indexterm" id="id416"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Make Sure the Host Is Ready" src="graphics/1800_0A_02.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, the database has been called<span class="strong"><strong> contechj_contechst</strong></span>, where<span class="strong"><strong> contechst</strong></span> is the name I chose for the live database, and<span class="strong"><strong> contechj_</strong></span> is the part that was added. Before we continue, it is important to note that this database needs a user, so ensure that it has one, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Make Sure the Host Is Ready" src="graphics/1800_0A_03.jpg"/></div><p>In this case, the<span class="strong"><strong> contechst</strong></span> database now has the user<span class="strong"><strong> contechj_david</strong></span>, and with that, the host site is pretty much ready to receive the new Drupal website. Remember, these usernames, passwords, and database names are all important for the configuration of the site, so ensure that you don't forget any of them. If you get stuck, get help from your host's support team; that's what they are there for.<a class="indexterm" id="id417"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Get the Files Ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec09"/>Get the Files Ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you do anything, you will need to make a master copy of the site before deployment. Make sure you zip up and store the exact version of the<code class="literal"> drupal</code> directory that you send across.<a class="indexterm" id="id418"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"/>Note</h3><p>At the moment the target URL for the Drupal index page will be something like<a class="ulink" href="http://www.domain_name.com/drupal/"> http://www.domain_name.com/drupal/</a>. If you want it to be<a class="ulink" href="http://www.domain_name.com/"> http://www.domain_name.com/</a>, then you will need to zip the files without the parent directory so that files are extracted directly to the<code class="literal"> public_html</code> folder on the live site.</p></div></div><p>While we are on the subject, you may as well clean up the Drupal file system properly so that you don't end up saving erroneous files.</p><p>If you're like me, then you probably create backups of all the files you modify as you work. As far as Windows machines go, these are denoted by<code class="literal"> .bak</code>, and placed in the same folder as the original file. Make a backup of your<code class="literal"> drupal</code> folder before deleting anything, just to be safe. Then remove all backup files from the<code class="literal"> drupal</code> folders.</p><p>While it might seem a bit excessive to do this at the moment, there are a couple of good reasons for it. First, having any sort of unused files lying around on your host file system is poor security practice. Second,<span class="emphasis"><em> why clutter up your brand-new installation with files you don't need?</em></span> You will find that it is a constant battle to keep everything neat and tidy as you go anyway—so start as you mean to go on. Finally, if you have worked on a lot of files over the course of the development phase, you are adding a lot of unnecessary size to the upload.</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note46"/>Note</h3><p>For security reasons, you should probably move your<code class="literal"> CHANGELOG.txt</code> file and<code class="literal"> update.php</code> files to a different location—take them out of the website and hold them elsewhere, where hackers can't get hold of them. If you need to make use of the<code class="literal"> update.php</code> script, then you can add it back to the site then.</p></div></div><p>Next, open up the configuration file,<code class="literal"> settings.php</code>, and remove the username and password. As you can probably deduce, the current database name and password will change to the ones you set when you created a new database on your host (if they're not the same), but there is no point in transferring any type of sensitive information like this—especially since people often prefer to use the same username and password for a variety of things.</p><p>Once this is done, you have to wait until the next section to add one more file and you can then make a master, zipped copy of your Drupal site—call it RTP (Release to Public) or something similar to distinguish it from other versions.</p><p>If you are working on a Linux box, you can<span class="strong"><strong> tar</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> gzip</strong></span> your files if you wish—it will obviously help with the upload time. If you are developing on Windows, then you might want to make sure that your host can unzip<code class="literal"> .zip</code> files since they will more than likely be using a Linux server—there shouldn't be a problem, however. In the unlikely event that there is, the best thing to do is download and install a gzip utility for Windows at<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gzip.org/">http://www.gzip.org/</a> , which you can then use to zip up your files in the<code class="literal"> .gz</code> format.<a class="indexterm" id="id419"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Get the Database Ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec10"/>Get the Database Ready</h2></div></div></div><p>As it stands, the database might hold plenty of silly posts which you used for testing, or it may hold a few important pages. There's no hard and fast rule here; just try not to transfer over a whole lot of stuff that you will end up deleting straight away anyway.</p><p>Talking of backups, that is really the main point of this section. In order to deploy the database, you will need to make a backup of it. It is this backup file that is then transferred across to the host site and used to create a new database there. Since you already have all the information you need regarding backups, we need look at them no further here.<a class="indexterm" id="id420"/>
</p><p>Once you have created your backup file of the entire Drupal database and added the resulting<code class="literal"> .sql</code> file somewhere to the<code class="literal"> drupal</code> folder (anywhere will do so long as you can find it again), you are now ready to begin transferring files across to your host. Note that you should remove the<code class="literal"> .sql</code> file from your site as soon as you have made use of it—hold it somewhere out of the document root in case you need to use it again.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Transfer the Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec08"/>Transfer the Files</h1></div></div></div><p>You should now have a final, clean version of your online store, with a copy of the database, all zipped up and ready to go. Assuming there are images and a fair bit of data held within the site, you can be sure that the size of the upload is quite substantial. For this reason, you need a reasonably high speed connection—dial-up connections can be slightly erratic over long periods of time, so it may even be worth using a friend's computer or your office connection to send the files to the host site.<a class="indexterm" id="id421"/>
</p><p>By far the easiest method would be to use a native upload feature from the host's file manager over a quick connection. If this is available to you, simply use it to upload the archive file across to the host server. The demo site has this facility as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Transfer the Files" src="graphics/1800_0A_04.jpg"/></div><p>Notice that the ZIP file is being uploaded to the<code class="literal"> public_html</code> folder, since this is the document root from which all web pages on this server are served.</p><p>Alternatively, assuming your site has an FTP account enabled, you can either attempt to use FTP drag and drop, which is exactly the same as moving files around on your PC in Windows, or you can use an FTP utility.<a class="indexterm" id="id422"/>
</p><p>When in doubt, simply get in touch with your host service and ask them for information about how to transfer files. The administrative interface and file manager for the vast majority of sites are easy to use, and you will have no problems uploading files. Because of this, we won't waste time discussing FTP utilities in detail. Simply ensure that, ultimately, the ZIP file ends up in the document root of your host's server. Remember not to leave the zip folder lying around in the document root once it has been used.<a class="indexterm" id="id423"/>
</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Setting Up the Site"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec09"/>Setting Up the Site</h1></div></div></div><p>At this stage, you should have a working database and be aware of what the username and password are for that database on your live site. You also have your archive file uploaded to the host site. At last, we finally move from working on the development machine to working on the live site. First thing's first though; we need to…</p><div class="section" title="Set Up the Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec11"/>Set Up the Files</h2></div></div></div><p>You will need to extract the archive file to your<code class="literal"> public_html</code> folder—most likely your hosts will provide you with this functionality. Take note of the second option in the list shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id424"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Set Up the Files" src="graphics/1800_0A_05.jpg"/></div><p>With these files extracted, you should now have a replica of the files from the development machine on your host's site. Check this by browsing through the live site. You should also find that if you attempt to browse one of the pages from a web browser, you no longer get a page‑not‑found error, but some other type of error—most likely a MySQL error because we don't have a database connection yet:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Set Up the Files" src="graphics/1800_0A_06.jpg"/></div><p>This is great news because it means that we are able to browse the files that are now on the live site with no problem. The fact that there is a Drupal error message here confirms that we are in fact browsing Drupal pages—note that the error message shown in the previous screenshot mentions a username and server that are not correct. This is here to demonstrate more clearly that we are browsing Drupal but we have not yet entered the correct database or configuration settings.<a class="indexterm" id="id425"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Set Up the Database"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec12"/>Set Up the Database</h2></div></div></div><p>If you have access to phpMyAdmin on your host site, then open it up and follow along:<a class="indexterm" id="id426"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the left-hand panel on the phpMyAdmin home page, click on the name of the database you installed earlier. (Recall that for the demo site, this was entitled<code class="literal"> contechj_contechst.)</code></li><li class="listitem">In the new page that opens up, click on the<span class="strong"><strong> SQL</strong></span> tab along the top of the page.</li><li class="listitem">Click<span class="strong"><strong> Browse</strong></span> under the<span class="strong"><strong> Location of Textfile</strong></span> option.</li><li class="listitem">Locate the file you would like to run against the database, and click<span class="strong"><strong> Go</strong></span>.</li></ol></div><p>If all goes according to plan, you will get a message informing you of the successful modifications to the database. You can then take a look through phpMyAdmin to ensure that the database has got whatever tables are needed.</p><p>It is possible that there may be issues between your host's system and the one you used to create the backup. For example, I initially received the following error:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Set Up the Database" src="graphics/1800_0A_07.jpg"/></div><p>This is because differing versions of MySQL sometimes use slightly differing syntax and it was necessary to remove all the<code class="literal"> DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8</code> statements from the<code class="literal"> .sql</code> file before everything ran smoothly.</p><p>If you do not have access to phpMyAdmin, then you will simply need to install the database using the<code class="literal"> .sql</code> file in whatever manner is appropriate for your particular site. Recall that you are able to run the<code class="literal"> .sql</code> file from the command line if you have access to that—if not, it's time to get in touch with the support team and find out how they recommend you run the contents of your<code class="literal"> .sql</code> file.<a class="indexterm" id="id427"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Configure the Site"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec13"/>Configure the Site</h2></div></div></div><p>With the database in place, go back to your<code class="literal"> settings.php</code> file in the<code class="literal"> sites/default/</code> folder on your live site and alter it according to your system's setup—take care to ensure that you add precisely the names and passwords required by your<span class="emphasis"><em> live database</em></span> to<code class="literal"> $db_url</code> as well as the correct URL for the live site in<code class="literal"> $base_url if that is required</code>.<a class="indexterm" id="id428"/>
</p><p>Once you have set the configuration settings appropriately save the file and then try browsing some pages. With a bit of luck you will see everything more or less as it was on the development machine.</p></div><div class="section" title="Access Problem?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec14"/>Access Problem?</h2></div></div></div><p>Try to log in to the administrator's account. I suspect that more than a few of you will come across a somewhat nasty surprise in that the browser will no doubt tell you that it cannot find the page you are looking for. If this is the case, it is more than likely because the<code class="literal"> .htaccess</code> file was not successfully ported to the live site:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>You must ensure that Drupal's</em></span>

<code class="literal"> .htaccess</code> in the Drupal parent folder contains instructions and information vital to the healthy operation of the site. Ensure that you transfer it directly, or cut and paste its contents into the live site's<code class="literal"> .htaccess</code> file.</p></div></div><p>When viewing the contents of the<code class="literal"> .htaccess</code> file on the live site (in Drupal's parent folder, most likely in the document root depending on how you have things set up), you should see something like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;IfModule mod_php5.c&gt;
php_value magic_quotes_gpc 0
php_value register_globals 0
php_value session.auto_start 0

&lt;/IfModule&gt;
# Various rewrite rules.
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;

# Modify the RewriteBase if you are using Drupal in a subdirectory and

#RewriteRule node.php index.php?q=node/view/%1 [L] ...
</pre></div><p>If that is the case, then you should find that it is possible to browse the live site as normal. Take heart, we are nearly done! The only thing left on the list of things to do for the moment is…<a class="indexterm" id="id429"/>
</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Testing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec10"/>Testing</h1></div></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What is the goal of testing in this instance?</em></span> Well, between now and the end of the chapter, we want to go from where we are to a fully functional, and most importantly, live and operational site. In order to get there, we need to ensure not only that everything works as expected from the customer's point of view, but also that the site is properly implemented and that we can administer it with no problems.</p><p>To give you an example of the type of thing that might rear its ugly head, take a look at the following error message I received the first time I tried to do a bit of administration on the live site:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Testing" src="graphics/1800_0A_08.jpg"/></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Can you spot the problem straight away?</em></span> Drupal is complaining that it cannot write to a<code class="literal"> files</code> directory that should be contained within<code class="literal"> C:\apache2triad\temp</code>. It's not surprising that this should be the case, because on the live site, there is<span class="emphasis"><em> no</em></span>
<code class="literal"> C:\apache2triad\temp</code> directory. In fact, the only reason this fully qualified path is here is because I initially wanted to demonstrate the private download method despite the fact that public access to files is suitable here.</p><p>This means that we need to re-enter the settings that were made with the development machine in mind to reflect the specifics of the live system:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Testing" src="graphics/1800_0A_09.jpg"/></div><p>Assuming you have the requisite permissions set so that Drupal can write and read in these folders, this particular problem is solved. (If you already have files on the site then you might need to move them to the directory you specify here.) Now, all that's left is to test out everything else in the administration tool to ensure it works correctly!</p><p>Here is a checklist for you to use in order to ensure that, from a user's point of view, the site works nicely:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>Site Checklist</p></div></div><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec11"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>For a task as important as building a full-featured community-driven website, it is necessary that you spend a lot of time considering your options, and developing and testing your site. Since it is not really feasible to do this sort of work on the live site, you need to employ a development machine to aid you. Because of this, the topic of deployment is an important one in the overall scheme of things because it is deployment that actually links your finished development to the live site.</p><p>This chapter outlined a solid process for preparing for deployment. It was also necessary to set up a new database on the host site, but this proved to be relatively easy because any good host makes the task fairly simple by providing a tool like phpMyAdmin to work with the database.</p><p>Hopefully you came to realize that the deployment process itself is not particularly complex for a Drupal site, since the only real configuration work that needs to be done is modifying the<code class="literal"> settings.php</code> file to reflect your new system's configuration. Having the complexity of the site's deployment reduced to configuring a single file is a real advantage for Drupal users.</p><p>While the actual deployment of the site is fairly simple, it was shown that there were quite a few issues to deal with, and not the least of them is testing. It is critical that a full suite of tests is carried out on any site before it goes live—losing valuable users to silly errors is the last thing that any competitive site needs.</p></div></body></html>
