    interface (screens, messages, buttons, e-mails, and so on) is translated into
    more than 50 languages. The translators are not members of the phpBB team, but
    are native-speaking volunteers, and this guarantees that the translations are
    correct and ready to be installed on your board. Thus, you provide a better service
    for your community, giving them an interface they feel more comfortable with.

    in the hands of the users, and your board is not responsible for hosting or managing
    the images. However, some users may want to use images that are on their hard
    drives and are nowhere to be found on the Internet. Also, because of the dynamic
    nature of the Internet, many pages and even whole sites appear and disappear in
    a single day. This means that an image your user selected today may not be available
    tomorrow, and some browsers (like Internet Explorer) will display a broken image
    icon instead, which is not pretty. Or even if an avatar is available but hosted
    on a slow site, it may slow the whole page down. There may be issues when the
    board members use avatars hosted on servers that dont allow hotlinking. Moreover,
    you dont have control over the sizes of the avatars. Somebody can put a real big
    picture as an avatar and ruin the whole look of a topic.'
  prefs:

    youre the one selecting them. The drawbacks are that these images will increase

    for heavily used boards with a lot of users. Another issue might be that some
    hosts may not allow you to use file uploads, because of the general concern that
    anything that a user does to a server can be potentially dangerous. Apart from
    that, uploaded avatars have quite a few benefits, like defining the size in pixels
    and the disk size in bytes for the images. With the uploaded avatars, users are
    free to use any possible image they can lay their hands on, not only those images

    the defaults may not be enough for them to express their emotions. Or it’s just
    that some of your members may be used to seeing different smilies in other boards
    that they visit, and miss those cute graphics in your board.

    a more widespread term, while "emoticons" is probably more accurate, because not
    all of the small round faces are smiling. One other interesting thing is that
    the word "smilie" can be spelled as "smilie" *and*"smiley". phpBB prefers "smiley"
    but a Google search returned more results on "smilie", so it’s apparently more
    often used. In this book, we’ve adopted "smilie".

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You already know how to use phpBB’s backup and restore utilities. It was mentioned
    that they might not work as expected, if you have a very big database and your
    hosting provider has set some rules on server resources usage. So now let’s take
    a look at using other means of achieving the same result. MySQL is the RDBMS used
    in this section; it’s the most popular to run phpBB on.
  prefs: []

- en: Using phpMyAdmin
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: phpMyAdmin can be used for backing up and restoring you forum database. It has
    an export utility that can help you create an SQL dump of a table or a database
    or even *all* the databases on a server. An SQL dump is a text file that contains
    all the necessary SQL commands needed to create a copy of a table or a database.
    phpBB’s database backup and restore utility uses the same SQL dumps.
  prefs: []

    know any of that. It was just an example to give an idea of what SQL dumps look
    like. The important thing is to know how to create them and use them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The good thing about phpMyAdmin is that it allows you to create SQL dumps of
    individual tables, not of the whole database in a single file. This is good—if
    you need to restore the database later on and your hosting provider has restrictions
    on the size of the files that you upload, then you may be able to work around
    the upload limit by splitting a possibly large database into several smaller SQL
    dumps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s look at an example that will help you understand the procedure of database
    backups and restoring using phpMyAdmin. For the sake of this and the other examples
    further in this chapter, let’s assume that the database that contains your board
    is named `forums`, your database username is `dbuser`, and your password to access
    the database is `dbpass`.

    site that is to blame for the flamewars. They just happen. They have been happening
    since the dawn of online communication, in Usenet groups, mailing lists, and so
    on. Flamewars are a part of the online communities; it’s a human thing.

    the life of your community miserable. It happens. The anonymity provided by the
    Internet can make some folks behave quite differently from what they really are.
    You’ll have to learn to live with this fact. But that doesn’t mean that you’ll
    have to tolerate such behavior. Some respected and valued community members may
    start limiting their participation and even leave the community for good, because
    of the bad behavior of those folks. This is something you don’t want to happen.

    At some point you’ll probably end up writing sticky postings like "Read me before
    you post", sort of terms of use. This is a good and a necessary step because it
    sets the ground rules. Without rules there’s no right nor wrong, everybody can
    have a different understanding of what is acceptable behavior and what is not.
    You also need to be careful when writing these rules not to make them too restrictive.
    These rules need to be respected, that’s why they are rules. So don’t set impossible
    goals and wishlist items as rules; be a realist.
