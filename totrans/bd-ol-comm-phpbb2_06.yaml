    about creating an appealing phpBB template is to get the idea for the layout.
    You might already have a homepage and would like to apply that layout, but many
    times I have seen people building the rest of their site around the layout of
    their phpBB template.

    is not some precious gift that very few people are endowed with. It is something
    everybody can learn in time, with practice and some patience. Find some layout
    ideas and tweak them until you are satisfied with the result; the more time you
    spend doing this, the more you will learn about yourself: what you like and what
    you don’t. Soon you will have developed your own style that you can turn almost
    anything into.'

    template layouts; magazines, newspapers, advertisings, homepages, constructions,
    art, or even basic wallpapers are just *some* of the inspiration sources I have
    found useful. Spending half an hour in a coffee shop with a pen drawing lines
    on a napkin can reveal the most appealing layout of all. It all depends on how
    "far" you’re willing to go with this, even though I doubt anyone can build a good
    template layout based on things like… a teapot!

    I liked the simplicity, the lines, and the rather big image. And even though it
    might not look like a phpBB template at first glance, I will try anyway, while

- en: The first thing I am going to do is to put together a rough, basic layout of
    the template in Photoshop. It doesn’t have to be precise or exact, but enough
    to get an estimated look of the template. There are some important things that
    need to be decided upon first, starting with the width of the layout. Making it
    100% wide is a very popular choice for HTML sites and templates, but it may not
    be such a good idea for this layout because of the image at the top. I need a
    fixed size. Also, in order to keep everything from getting too large, I have decided
    to shrink the entire layout down to a width of just 780 pixels. That will leave
    some "air" on the sides of the forum and also look more like a paper-based layout.
    With this width there are 20 pixels allocated to the scrollbar, for those who
    have screen resolution 800x600 pixels.

    contest long time ago. I have always wanted to use this image for one of my projects
    and this seemed to be a good opportunity. The format of the image is 717x231 pixels,
    which fits nicely, neither too big nor too small.

    look good with the same color as the background, so instead I give them a light
    gray shade.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is hard to get a good color feeling going, since the colors of my PSD image
    don’t match the rest of the template layout. After some trials with new background
    and forum colors that could match the image, I end up changing the image into
    an empty gray box, so as to match the light gray color of the forum. However,
    I still feel this is not the best solution; it looks much too empty.

    some paint spills, and with red color I manage to get something that looks like
    nosebleed. A bit morbid maybe, but it looks quite good, simple, and neat. I add
    the title ‘NoseBleed’ with a font I find well-fitted for the image, making it
    more dynamic.

    code, cascading style sheet code (CSS), and phpBB variables. The first file is
    always the `overall_header.tpl`, and the last one is always the `overall_footer.tpl`.
    The middle of these three `.tpl` files displays the actual content of what we
    can see on that specific page. If, for example, we are viewing the index page
    of the forum, what we see is the code of `overall_header.tpl, index_body.tpl`,
    and `overall_footer.tpl` put together. Or if we go to the login page, the .tpl
    files shown are `overall_header.tpl, login_body.tpl`, and `overall_footer.tpl`,
    and so on. This is quite handy since we only need to edit one `.tpl` file, the
    `overall_header.tpl`, in order to make changes in the top part of all the pages
    shown by the browser.

    paper would already have the company name, logo, and address at the top (`overall_header.tpl`),
    and maybe also an address line at the bottom (`overall_footer.tpl`). You would
    write your individual message in the middle (the middle `.tpl` file). No matter
    how many letters you wrote, and no matter how different the content of the letters
    was, you would always have the same header and footer. It’s the `.tpl` in the
    middle that brings the phpBB forum to life.

    even though there is no need for this file right now. Lastly we need to replace
    every instance of `subSilver` in the `theme_info.cfg` file with `NoseBleed`. If

    a WYSIWYG editor for editing, like Dreamweaver. It can have some advantages like
    being able to see an approximated view of the layout while coding. However, I
    don’t recommend using the code that these editors can insert automatically, since
    there is a chance that phpBB can conflict with this kind of code. We could also
    use Word, WordPad, or any other text editor, as long as we remember to save the
    document as plain ASCII code, since phpBB can not read rich-text formatted `.tpl`
    files.
