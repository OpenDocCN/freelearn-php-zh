- en: I am fortunate to have lived and worked in California for a long time. The majority
    of that time, I lived in Palo Alto, which is the center of Silicon Valley, the
    home of Stanford University, and the birthplace of many companies, big and small,
    such as Sun Microsystems, where I worked. I sat on the front row to see how the
    World Wide Web developed, as well as being present for the advent of social media.
    Facebook started on the other side of the wall of my favorite restaurant. Now,
    some Facebook guy or girl is sitting in what used to be my office at the bottom
    of the Dumbarton Bridge. As a product manager for Solaris, one of my tasks was
    to make sure that Netscape Navigator was included with our operating system. So,
    I was right at the source in which the development of the Web began. I even went
    to the Web 2.0 conference and bought the book of the same name.

    people about the beauty and interesting places of the parts of California that
    I had discovered during my many journeys travelling around the state. So, I created
    one. One day, I was telling a friend about it and he tried to look at it on his
    mobile phone. It looked terrible. So, I bought a Nokia phone (a brick compared
    to what we have today) so that I could test my own site to make sure that it looked
    good on a phone as well. This is how I caught the bug of responsive design, years
    before someone started calling it this.

- en: Upon my return to Belgium, I decided that it was time to learn as much as possible
    (I love to learn new things) about what is out there beyond creating websites
    and took a 6-month course on PHP web development. A lot of it looked familiar
    as I was previously a UNIX and C developer. There were only 12 people in the class,
    who were all bright minds, and I quickly discovered that there was more to learn.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the classes took place in Leuven, a major university town in Belgium, I went
    to the local university bookstore and bought book after book on all kinds of related
    topics and quickly became a jQuery fan. jQuery, by the way, was not even included
    in the course. I started wondering why someone needed to have 35 different books
    to learn about web development and that writing a single book that gave a comprehensive
    overview of what you need to know to engage in web development would not be a
    bad idea.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since then, web development has changed a lot; more books were needed, eBooks
    this time, but the concept remained the same. So, now you know why I wrote the
    book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book gives you an overview of all the general aspects of web development,
    in a traditional way, using plain HTML to do static websites, as well as the current
    way, to enable you to create your web pages dynamically and make sure that they
    look great on mobile devices as well, by using responsive design. We conclude
    by giving you a hint of what is yet to come if you replace the traditional web
    server by writing your own using node.js.

    gives you an overview of the history of what we know today as the World Wide Web.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. HTML"), *HTML*, introduces HTML and gives
    you an overview of the most commonly used HTML tags to do web development. You
    will be able to create a basic website after reading this chapter.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. CSS"), *CSS*, explains how to use Cascading
    Style Sheets (CSS). This is used for the presentation part or layout of your website,
    from color to dimensions to typefaces. The most commonly used CSS properties are
    explained here. Once you are done with this chapter, you will be able to make
    your basic website look good.'

    an introduction to the world of programming and programming languages. Next, the
    overall syntax of JavaScript and how to use it for client-side programming is
    introduced.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. PHP"), *PHP*, explains PHP, which is another
    programming language. This one is used to do server-side programming. It requires
    a web server to do the development of your website and deploy it. You will learn
    how to dynamically create your web pages, rather than having to write a bunch
    of HTML files.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. PHP and MySQL"), *PHP and MySQL*, introduces
    MySQL, an open source database. You will learn how to create a database, manage
    it using the phpMyAdmin tool, and perform basic CRUD (create, replace, update,
    delete) operations from within a PHP program.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. jQuery"), *jQuery*, covers a popular JavaScript
    library. It allows you to write more compact and clean code and handles browser
    incompatibilities for you. With this, it is going to be a lot easier and faster
    for you to write JavaScript code that traverses and manipulates the web page.
    It does so by using selectors, which you learned to use with CSS. So, with jQuery,
    you can write JavaScript code without having to learn a lot of JavaScript.'

    a collection of techniques to make it easy to dynamically change only portions
    of a website. With this chapter, we have entered the world of what I call "modern
    web development". The interface that we use for our Ajax calls is jQuery.'

    Are"), *The History API—Not Forgetting Where We Are*, explains a very important
    piece of the web development puzzle. Once we are changing pages on the fly so
    they look different but actually remain the same page (URL), strange things can
    happen when visitors want to go back to what they think is the previous page.
    A solution for this is described here that will not only work for HTML5 but for
    HTML4 as well.'

    XML and JSON. They are two popular formats to exchange data, for example the server
    and the client. Although XML is used in a variety of environments, JSON is closer
    to the web development community.'

    from within a PHP program is described.'
