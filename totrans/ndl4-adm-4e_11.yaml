- en: In most organizations, mobile learning is becoming the norm for e-learning and
    forms a crucial part of curriculum delivery. Mobile learning gives learners more
    flexibility whenever and wherever learning takes place; it offers self-directed
    and independent learning, supports on-the-job training, and boosts micro-learning.
    Mobile devices are typically used for consumption and communication rather than
    authoring and administration.

    with a Moodle system. The app is most suited for learners and supports key functionality
    for participants to access course content, receive notifications, upload data,
    monitor progress, and interact with other users. The app is an alternative to
    accessing Moodle via a web browser on a smartphone or tablet and has the advantage
    of being specifically designed for mobile usage, both online and offline.

    progress from a mobile device, there are several things to consider. First, a
    decision must be made on accessing the LMS, either from a mobile web browser or
    a dedicated app. This chapter focuses on the mobile app, which has to be enabled
    centrally. Second, users must download and install the app before the first login.
    And third, users must authenticate via the mobile app. This section will cover
    all of these items, starting with a short introduction about ways to access the
    Moodle app from a mobile device.

    the book, only it is optimized via responsive design for smaller screen sizes.
    There are three main arguments relating to using Moodle via a mobile browser—users
    have the same functionality available as on a desktop device, the handling is
    identical, and users won’t have to install an extra app on their mobile device.

    have been optimized for mobile usage. Furthermore, offline usage and synchronization
    are supported, indicated by a little cloud symbol. Another advantage of the mobile
    app over the browser view is the support of push notifications, which we have
    all become accustomed to.

- en: Let’s go through the preceding diagram from left to right and back again. When
    a user makes requests via the web interface, the browser passes the request to
    the web server, which calls the responsible PHP module. The PHP module calls the
    database with an action (a query, update, insert, or delete operation), which
    returns the requested data. Based on this information, the PHP module returns
    data (usually in HTML or JavaScript) to the web server, which passes the information
    to be displayed back to the user’s browser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When accessing a Moodle instance via the app, the process is precisely the same
    except for the first step, which involves calling web services requesting data
    from the web server. The same applies to the returning information, which is also
    passed through web services. Web services are the standard communication protocol
    between web and mobile applications. You will find more information on this topic
    in [*Chapter 18*](B18779_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor337), *Integrating External Systems

    a (small) degree of risk. This approach will not be acceptable for some privacy-conscious
    organizations, so it is possible to set up your own notification infrastructure,
    which involves setting up a local Airnotifier server. You will find instructions
    on how to do this and links to related resources at [docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_app_notifications](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_app_notifications).
