- en: Everything we have dealt with so far, as important as it may be in terms of
    creating our own unique site, must take a back seat when it comes to the topic
    of content and content management in Drupal. After all, content *is* what this
    is all about! With the explosion in the number of sites offering dynamic content,
    it is now an absolute necessity to provide meaningful, dynamic, and relevant information
    on your site in order to prosper. How this is done behind the scenes is really
    of no concern to a site's users, but if you can make their browsing experience
    hassle free and relevant to them, they will stick with you.

  zh: 我们迄今为止处理的所有内容，尽管在创建我们自己的独特网站方面可能很重要，但在Drupal的内容和内容管理主题上必须退居次要位置。毕竟，内容*就是*这一切的核心！随着提供动态内容网站数量的激增，现在提供有意义的、动态的、相关的内容以繁荣发展是绝对必要的。用户对幕后如何操作并不关心，但如果你能让他们浏览体验无烦恼且对他们相关，他们就会继续使用你的网站。
- en: '*What does hassle free mean in this context?* Content needs to be easy to find,
    which in turn means it needs to be well organized. It needs to be well presented
    and easy to interact with—in other words, simple to use. Most of this is taken
    care of already by Drupal, and for very little additional effort, we can provide
    some very powerful functionality. However, before we look at adding more functionality,
    we should really ensure that we have a good grasp of how to use what is already
    in place.'

  zh: 以下表格列出了与Drupal默认一起发货的内容类型：
- en: '| blog entry | A blog, or weblog, is an author-specific content type that is
    used as a journal or diary, among other things, by individuals. In Drupal, each
    blog writer can, depending on the site''s settings and their permissions, add
    attachments, HTML, or PHP code to their blog.A good example of a blog can be found
    at: [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/), which

    |'
- en: '| Book Page | A book is an organized set of book page types (actually any type
    can be used nowadays), which are intended to be used for collaborative authoring.
    Book pages may be added by different people in order to make up one single book,
    which can then be structured into chapters and pages, or in whatever structure
    is most appropriate, provided it is in a hierarchical structure.Because pretty
    much any data type can be added to a book, there is plenty of scope for exciting
    content (think of narrated or visual content complementing dynamic book pages,
    created with PHP and Flash animations, to create a truly unique Internet-based
    book—the possibilities are endless!).A good example of a book is the documentation
    provided for developers on the Drupal site, found at:[http://drupal.org/node/316](http://drupal.org/node/316).
    This has been built up over time by a number of different authors.You will notice
    that if you have the book module enabled, an additional outline tag is presented
    above all/most of the site''s posts. Clicking on this tab allows you to add that
    post to a book—in this way, books can be built up from content posted to the site.

  zh: '| 书页 | 书是由一系列书页类型（实际上现在可以使用任何类型）组成的有序集合，旨在用于协作写作。书页可以由不同的人添加，以组成一本书，然后可以将其结构化为章节和页面，或者采用最合适的任何结构，只要它是层次结构即可。由于几乎任何数据类型都可以添加到书中，因此有大量的空间来创造令人兴奋的内容（想想用PHP和Flash动画创建的动态书页，以及与之相辅相成的叙述或视觉内容，以创建一个真正独特的基于互联网的书——可能性是无限的！）。一个很好的书页例子是Drupal网站上为开发者提供的文档，可以在[http://drupal.org/node/316](http://drupal.org/node/316)找到。这些文档是由多位不同的作者随着时间的推移逐步建立起来的。你会注意到，如果你启用了书模块，所有/大多数网站帖子上方都会显示一个额外的轮廓标签。点击此标签允许你将帖子添加到书中——这样，书就可以从网站上发布的内容中构建起来。

    like the other types. In other words, you can''t create a comment in the way that
    you create any other content. Instead, you can tack comments on to other content
    types, and these are very popular as a means to stimulate discussion among users.You
    can see comments in action by logging in to the Drupal forums, [http://drupal.org/forum](http://drupal.org/forum)
