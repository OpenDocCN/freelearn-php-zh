<p>Drupal 8 is a powerful web-based <strong>content management system</strong> (<strong>CMS</strong>) that can be used to build anything from simple websites to powerful applications. While it is useful out of the box, it is designed with developers in mind.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to talk about the most common ways a Drupal 8 website can be extended to provide new functionality. In doing so, the book will cover a number of extension points, but also illustrate many subsystems and APIs that can help you model, structure, and wire your business requirements.</p>
<p>Alongside the obligatory theoretical explanations, it will use a practical, example-based approach in order to break down complex topics and make them easier to understand. So, join me on this journey to discover exactly how powerful Drupal 8 actually is.</p>

<p>The primary target audience for this book is Drupal 7 developers who want to learn how to write modules and carry out development in Drupal 8. It is also intended for Drupal site builders who have basic object-oriented programming skills, as well as PHP programmers who have little experience of <span>Drupal</span>.</p>
<p>A little bit of Symfony experience will be beneficial, but isn't mandatory.</p>
