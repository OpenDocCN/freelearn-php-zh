<p>WordPress is a worldwide phenomenon, with users embracing the platform all around the globe. To create a more specific experience for users in different locales, WordPress offers the ability to translate all of its user- and visitor-facing content, resulting in numerous localizations becoming available for download online. Like most other functionalities in the platform, internationalization is also available to plugin developers through a set of easy-to-use functions--the main difference being that plugin translations are typically included with the extension, instead of being downloaded separately as is the case with WordPress.</p>
<p>To prepare their plugin to be localized, developers must use special internationalization functions when dealing with text elements. Once this structure is in place, any users can create localizations by themselves for languages that they know and submit them back to the plugin author for inclusion in a future update to the extension. WordPress.org also offers an online interface for users to be able to contribute translations without requiring to use offline tools.</p>
<p>This chapter explains how to prepare a plugin to be translated and shows how to use the Poedit tool to create a new language file for a simple plugin.</p>

<p>The first step to translate a plugin is to configure WordPress to a different language setting other than English. This will automatically trigger mechanisms in the platform to look for alternate language content for any internationalized string.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will set the site to <span class="packt_screen">French</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Site Language</span> configuration option of WordPress allows you to select the language that will be seen by visitors when they go to your website. As can be seen in the drop-down list of languages, WordPress has a single language installed by default, shown at the top of the list. The remainder of the list indicates languages that can be added to your website. When you set a new language, translation files are automatically downloaded for the selected language and the new selection becomes the default for visitors. If you look inside the <kbd>wp-content/languages</kbd> directory of your WordPress installation, you will see that a number of files with <kbd>.po</kbd> and <kbd>.mo</kbd> extensions were downloaded for the selected language. Portable object (<kbd>.po</kbd>) files are ASCII text files that contain a list of all the original English text from the WordPress source code, while machine object (<kbd>.mo</kbd>) files are binary versions of the translation table that have been compiled to be efficiently loaded by PHP as a website is rendered.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you are not presented with a list of languages to install automatically in the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> section of the <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span>, visit <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language">https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language</a> to learn how to manually download and install translation files for WordPress.</div>

<p>Before we can create translation files for our own plugins, their code needs to be specifically written to allow text items to be translated. This work starts in the plugin's activation routine, where default plugin option values are set, to find alternate values when a language other than English is specified in the website's configuration file.</p>
<p>This recipe shows how to assign a translated string to a plugin's default options array on initialization.</p>

<p>The <kbd>__</kbd> function (that's two underscores) is a WordPress utility function that tries to find a translation for the text that it receives in its first argument within the text domain specified in the second argument. A text domain is essentially a subsection of the global translation table that is managed by WordPress. In this example, the text to be translated is the string <kbd>Hello World</kbd>, for which the system tries to find a translation in the <kbd>ch11hw_hello_world</kbd> domain. Since this domain is not available at this time, the function returns the original string that it received as its first parameter. The plugin code assigns the value it receives to the default configuration array.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the <kbd>__</kbd> function is actually an alias for the <kbd>translate</kbd> function. While both functions have the same functionality, using <kbd>__</kbd> makes the code shorter when it contains a lot of text elements to be translated.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">While it may be tempting for developers to use a variable or constant in the first parameter of the <kbd>__</kbd> function if they need to display the same text multiple times, this should not be done, as it will cause problems with the translation lookup mechanism.</div>

<p>While the previous recipe showed how to look up the translation of a text item and return its value for further processing in the plugin code, there are many instances where it is more practical to display the translated content immediately.</p>
<p>This recipe shows how to translate the contents of a simple administration page for immediate display.</p>

<p>This recipe makes use of the <kbd>__</kbd> function, covered in the previous recipe, along with the <kbd>_e</kbd> function. This second function's purpose is similar to <kbd>__</kbd>, except that it immediately echoes the outcome of the translation lookup to the browser. It should be used for all text elements that would previously have just been simple text in HTML code. Of course, making a call to this function requires the presence of standard opening and closing PHP tags (<kbd>&lt;?</kbd> and <kbd>?&gt;</kbd>) to be executed among the surrounding HTML.</p>
<p>The rest of this plugin's code takes care of storing user updates in the website database, as covered previously in <a href="0346c3c6-27ee-45fb-bfd6-df398e04b2b4.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter</span> <span class="ChapterrefPACKT">3</span></a>, <em>User Settings and Administration Pages</em>.</p>

<p>As we have seen in numerous recipes, shortcodes are powerful tools that provide an easy way for users to add content to their website posts and pages. Since this content is presented to users, it can benefit from a translation just as much as the website's administration pages.</p>
<p>This recipe shows how to translate shortcode output before it is displayed. It also explains how to deal with variable data elements that can be positioned differently between languages.</p>

<p>This recipe shows something that's a bit more complex than the previous two, as we want the shortcode output to be a combination of static text with a dynamic element, and we want that element to appear in different places based on the grammatical structure of the target language. The way to achieve this functionality is to combine the <kbd>__</kbd> internationalization function with the <kbd>sprintf</kbd> standard PHP function.</p>
<p>The purpose of the <kbd>sprintf</kbd> function is to insert a variable in a string. It performs this task by looking for a placeholder in the target string sent in the first argument, and replaces it with the variable that it receives as its second argument. Some examples of placeholders are <kbd>%s</kbd> for a string and <kbd>%d</kbd> for an integer. With this functionality in mind, we use a placeholder as part of the string to be translated so that users who create localization files can choose where the value will be placed as part of the sentence structure. Once the translation has been obtained by the <kbd>__</kbd> function, we can immediately send the alternate language string to <kbd>sprintf</kbd> to create the final text.</p>

<p>After inserting all the necessary code to look up translations for text elements, we need to create the actual translation files. While there are multiple tools available to perform this task, we will focus our efforts around the most popular one, the free multiplatform Poedit.</p>
<p>This recipe shows how to extract all the strings to be translated from the plugin's code using Poedit, translate them, and save the resulting language file under the plugin directory.</p>

<p>You should have already followed the <em>Modifying shortcode output for translation</em> recipe to have a starting point for this recipe. Alternatively, you can get the resulting code (<kbd>Chapter 11/ch11-hello-world/ch11-hello-world-v3.php</kbd>) for that recipe from the code bundle. You should rename the file to <kbd>ch11-hello-world.php</kbd> before starting.</p>

<p>The Poedit tool searches through PHP files, looking for functions that have specific names, as specified in the <span class="packt_screen">Keywords</span> configuration section. It looks through all the files located in the same directory as the catalog itself and in any additional folders specified under the <span class="packt_screen">Paths</span> section of the catalog settings. By specifying <kbd>..</kbd> as an additional path, we tell Poedit to look one directory up from the <kbd>languages</kbd> folder, where the plugin files are located.</p>
<p>Based on the configuration that we specified, Poedit is able to find all the instances of the <kbd>__</kbd> and <kbd>_e</kbd> functions in the plugin code and retrieve the text strings that are set as the first argument to these functions. Once all the strings have been found, Poedit provides a simple interface to provide translations for each string and saves the resulting translation file. Upon saving, Poedit actually creates two files, the portable object file and the machine object file.</p>
<p>The name of the language files is made from two parts: the name of the text domain, <kbd>ch11hw_hello_world</kbd>, which was used in all of our calls to the <kbd>__</kbd> and <kbd>_e</kbd> functions in the previous recipes, and the target language code, <kbd>fr_CA</kbd>, to match the language configuration that we set earlier in this chapter. To support all the variants of the French language that WordPress supports, you can copy the translation files, changing the language code each time in the Poedit catalog configuration, as well as in the file names (<kbd><span>ch11hw_hello_world-</span><span>fr_CA.po</span></kbd> <span>and <kbd>ch11hw_hello_world-fr_BE.po</kbd>).</span></p>

<p>When you are only familiar with English, you can create a translation template that only contains the text to be translated by saving the catalog as a <kbd>.pot</kbd> file instead of a <kbd>.po</kbd>/<kbd>.mo</kbd> combination. In addition to the special extension, the filename should not contain a language tag (for example, <kbd>ch11hw_hello_world.pot</kbd>).</p>

<p>The <kbd>load_plugin_textdomain</kbd> function has three arguments. When called, it looks in the folder specified in the last parameter for a <kbd>.mo</kbd> file with a name starting with the text domain specified in the first parameter, followed by the current language set in the WordPress configuration file. If found, the translation file is loaded in memory and is used to search for translations every time the <kbd>__</kbd> or <kbd>_e</kbd> functions are encountered during execution. The middle argument, set to a <kbd>false</kbd> value, is obsolete but is still needed for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Once all the hooks are in place in the plugin code, and a first translation file (or template) is made available with the plugin, users can easily modify text elements to other languages, which they can use immediately. They can also provide these new translations back to the plugin author for inclusion in future updates. We added a second call to <kbd>load_plugin_textdomain</kbd> in the activation hook, since the <kbd>init</kbd> action hook is not executed when activation hooks execute.</p>

<p>When new calls to the <kbd>__</kbd> or <kbd>_e</kbd> functions are made in a plugin, the translation file needs to be updated to take new text elements into account. To do this, start the Poedit tool and open the existing catalog. Then, select <span class="packt_screen">Update</span> from the toolbar. This will extract all the text items and identify new entries. Once this is done, new items can be translated and saved back to the catalog file.</p>

<p>While we used the most common internationalization functions in this chapter, there are a few more advanced functions that may be useful in your efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>_n( $singular, $plural, $number, $domain )</kbd>: This function will look up one of the first two strings received, depending on whether the number is one or more.</li>
<li><kbd>_x( $text, $context, $domain )</kbd>: Adds a parameter to the localization lookup to add a context parameter. This is useful when dealing with words that have the same spelling but different meanings.</li>
<li><kbd>_ex( $text, $context, $domain )</kbd>: Same as <kbd>_x</kbd> but echoes the result of the lookup.</li>
<li><kbd>_nx( $singular, $plural, $number, $context, $domain)</kbd>: Same as <kbd>_n</kbd> with the additional context parameter from <kbd>_x</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of functions that will perform a localization lookup immediately, followed by the escape of the resulting string. These functions include <kbd>esc_attr__()</kbd>, <kbd>esc_attr_e()</kbd>, <kbd>esc_html__()</kbd>, <kbd>esc_html_x()</kbd>, and many more.

<p>JavaScript files are a bit more tricky to translate, as they are often read from an external file that cannot contain any PHP code. The solution to this is the <kbd>wp_localize_script</kbd> function. When called, this function declares new variables in scripts that have already been queued up to be loaded, and populates these variables with localized strings. Upon execution, the code will be able to access and display the proper text on screen. The following code snippet is an example showing how to use the function:</p>
<pre>wp_enqueue_script( 'script_handle' );<br/>$translation_vars = array( 'string_val' =&gt; <br/>                           __( 'Text to be translated' ) );<br/>wp_localize_script( 'script_handle', 'javascript_object',   <br/>                    $translation_vars );  </pre>
<p>In the previous code example, a new object called <kbd>javascript_object</kbd> will be created inside the <kbd>script_handle</kbd> script, with a data member called <kbd>string_val</kbd> that contains a translation of the target text in the current WordPress language, if available.</p>
