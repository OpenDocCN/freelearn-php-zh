- en: Blocks add functionality to your site or course and they can be placed in many
    different locations on the page to help focus attention on content and provide
    useful information, such as assignment due dates on a calendar, course completion
    status, course overview, and more. Blocks are very flexible and have a wide array
    of uses. They are often used to build the student's self-confidence by helping
    them keep on track and manage their time effectively. This chapter will describe
    many of Moodle's blocks, help you decide which ones will meet your goals, and
    tell you how to implement them.

    they are used. Afer that, we will look at some of the commonly used blocks and
    examples of them. Once we have seen these common blocks and examples, we will
    learn how to configure a block depending on where we want to place it. Finally,
    we will look at some of the most commonly used blocks that Moodle has to offer.
    Throughout this chapter, you will be asked to consider how best to align blocks
    with course objectives.

- en: Blocks are great tools because they help you cluster content for easy use, and
    they can be organized around learning goals. Blocks are plugins that arrange chunks
    of text and links. They can be added to the side of a page in Moodle and can remind
    you of what a sidebar breakout looks like in a printed textbook. A block usually
    displays information in a small area in one of the side columns. For example,
    a block can display a calendar, the latest news, or the students enrolled in a
    course.

    course and thus act as navigation bars. It is important to keep in mind that not
    all instructional designers or course designers like using blocks, and some even
    consider them a bit anchored in the past. Those who do not like blocks often point
    to the Dashboard as a better alternative.

    on the site's front page. When configuring a course, you can also show/hide/position
    blocks on the course's home page. The procedure is the same as working on the
    site's front page or a course's home page. The site's front page is essentially
    a course. You can also permit students to add blocks to their **Dashboard** page
    and **My profile** page. Please keep in mind that some Moodle themes have pre-established
    blocks, so you may not be able to add blocks or reposition them.

    places, some of these settings have no effect. You can set the region on the page
    where the block will appear, and also which page types will feature the blocks.
    Notice that you must specify the block's weight. This is how you fine-tune where
    it appears on the page. **0** puts the block at the bottom, while **10** puts
    it at the top. Be sure to experiment with different settings to see how the block's
    position changes when you adjust the values.

    creates a block in the sidebar that can hold any HTML (or any web content) that

    in the sidebars being an addition to the main content of a page. For example,
    we can put menus and interesting links in the sidebars in most blogging software.
    I suggest that you keep with that standard. Use the **Text** block to hold content

    in. If someone is logged in as a guest user, this block displays any activity
    since the last time that guest logged in. If guest users are constantly coming
    to your site, this block may be of limited use to them. One strategy is to omit
    this block from the site's front page so that anonymous users don't see it and
    add it only to courses that require users to authenticate.

    chooses or creates the RSS feeds to display in that block. When RSS feeds were
    first developed, they tended to be used in conjunction with subscribing to a person's
    blog. Now, they are in the backend and used for subscribing to podcasts, which
    have become more popular than ever. Podcast hosting services such as Podbean,
    Resonate, Captivate, and Buzzsprout automatically list their hosted podcasts on
    players and distribution platforms such as SoundCloud, Apple Podcasts, Google
    Podcasts, Spotify, TuneIn, and Overcast.

    creator for use in an RSS block. Alternatively, when the teacher adds the **Remote
    RSS feeds** block, they can add a feed at that time. If **Share feed** is set
    to **Yes**, the new feed becomes available to all other teachers, for use in all
    other courses.

- en: In this chapter, we looked at many of the blocks that are available in Moodle
    4.0\. Keep in mind that with 4.0, blocks appear on the Dashboard, and you can
    set them to appear on course pages to help remind your students of upcoming events,
    display important information, and keep them engaged. When deciding which blocks
    to use, resist the temptation to add too many. Blocks are helpful, but they can
    be a distraction and also confuse priorities. Use blocks strategically to make
    sure students stay on track, and also to flag important information. You can also
    use them as consistent motivators, where reminders of their positive achievements
    appear. Remember that you can turn blocks off and on as needed. The key is to
    use blocks to enable students to succeed. You can use blocks as signposts and
    guides. However, avoid overusing blocks since they can be distracting.
