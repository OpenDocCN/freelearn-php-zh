    available at their fingertips. Ever since, people have been working hard on creating
    various internet applications and comprehensive services that will make our lives
    easier, and with these came e-commerce stores. Consequently, Shopify was born.

    the name *Shopify* has come up at least once, *but what is Shopify?* **Shopify**
    is a multinational e-commerce company based in Ottawa, Canada, that offers various
    comprehensive services to its clients. This subscription-based service provides
    everything from buying the domain to building and managing a future dream store

    store builder or a tool to sell products. Instead, it has established itself as
    an e-commerce powerhouse that allows anyone to build the store and create a unique
    experience for their shoppers. Being a template-based store builder, Shopify offers
    various free or paid themes to enable store customization, enabling you to use
    the intuitive and straightforward theme editor without any development knowledge.
    However, if the end goal is to create an utterly unique store with various customization
    options at our fingertips, then we will require a developer with Liquid knowledge
    to customize the theme and create additional options inside the code editor.

    that assembles people from all over the world and offers them the ability to build
    new e-commerce stores for store owners, design themes, develop apps, and refer
    new clients to Shopify. One of the most enticing extensions of the platform is
    that it will allow us to create a development store to practice our Liquid knowledge.

    is encouraged. However, we should keep in mind that Shopify only allows up to
    20 duplicate themes per store. After we reach that limit, we will receive a notification
    that we have reached a limit of 20 duplicate themes per store. This limitation
    will also prevent us from creating a new theme duplicate, and if we want to make
    another one, we will need to delete some of the older theme duplicates that we
    no longer use.

    our new theme to avoid potential future confusion.
