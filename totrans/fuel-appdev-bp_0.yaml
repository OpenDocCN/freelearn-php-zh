- en: The main idea behind *FuelPHP Application Development Blueprints* is to teach
    you FuelPHP's basic and advanced features by building various projects of increasing
    levels of complexity. It is very result-oriented; at the beginning of the chapters,
    we specify the application we want to build, and then we progressively implement
    it by learning how to use new FuelPHP features along the way. Our approach will
    therefore be very practical; a lot of concepts will be explained using code examples,
    or by integrating them directly into our projects. Thus, it is important to highlight
    that there will be a lot of code and you should be comfortable with reading and
    understanding PHP and HTML. As we will use them from time to time, having some
    knowledge about server/system administration and some foundation in JavaScript,
    jQuery, and CSS will be an added advantage.

- en: Though this book is for intermediary to advanced web developers, any prior knowledge
    of the FuelPHP framework, or any other PHP framework, is not required. In order
    to understand this book, you don't have to know common concepts such as MVC, HMVC,
    or ORM. We take into account this shortcoming some of you might have, and important
    notions will be explained. We won't explain all of those in the first chapter
    though, as we want this to be as painless as possible; we will instead approach
    them when they become necessary for the project completion.

- en: The ultimate purpose of *FuelPHP Application Development Blueprints* is to give
    you the ability to build any project using FuelPHP. By the end of this book, you
    certainly won't know every little detail of the framework, but you will hopefully
    have the necessary toolbox required to implement complex and maintainable projects.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Building Your First FuelPHP Application"),
    *Building Your First FuelPHP Application,* covers the very basics of the FuelPHP
    framework; how to install it, how to configure it, how it is organized, and its
    main components. Along the way, we will generate our first FuelPHP application
    using the oil utility and tweak some files, in order to illustrate how things
    work.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Building a To-do List Application"), *Building
    a To-do List Application,* focuses on FuelPHP''s ORM and debugging features. We
    will illustrate these features using a lot of examples, and then implement a small
    to-do list application. We will also use some JavaScript and jQuery to send AJAX
    requests.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Building a Blog Application"), *Building
    a Blog Application,* will teach you how to generate and tweak an administration
    interface easily, how to create your own modules and tasks, how to manage paginations
    easily, and how to use the Auth and Email packages. We will create a blog application
    implementing all these features.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Creating and Using Packages"), *Creating
    and Using Packages,* will approach the FuelPHP package system. This is a rather
    short chapter; we will first try to protect our website from spam bots by installing
    an existing package, and then create our own original solution by creating a new
    package.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Building Your Own Restful API"), *Building
    Your Own RESTful API,* covers more advanced subjects such as building a JSON API,
    using language agnostic template engines, allowing user subscriptions, and implementing
    unit tests. To illustrate this, we will create a responsive micro blogging application
    featuring a public API.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Building a Website Using Novius OS"), *Building
    a Website Using Novius OS,* will quickly introduce you to Novius OS, a FuelPHP-based
    Content Management System. Using such a system can greatly speed up the implementation
    of complex projects.'
