- en: Living in a world where synchronous web conference delivery is a major part
    of content delivery means that your on-demand resources and activities need to
    be easily accessed, clearly mapped to course objectives, and incorporated into
    a web conference if needed. Further, as you develop your courses and curriculum
    in Moodle, it is important to plan well so that there is a level of consistency
    in an organization and presentation. Not only will you standardize your curriculum
    – you will also standardize your courses. Although it's easy to think that the
    flashiest content or assessment should be showcased, the reality is that you should
    keep your attention focused on the course learning objectives. All your content
    and assessments should map directly to the learning objectives. This chapter does
    not focus on specific resources or activities; that content is covered in later
    chapters. Our goal for this chapter is to provide an overview of the content that
    goes into your course and how to manage it at the course level. We'll introduce
    resources and activities but will not go into detail about each one until later
    chapters. Right now, the goal is to be able to see the big picture in order to
    plan your courses.

  zh: 在一个同步网络会议交付是内容交付主要部分的世界上生活，意味着你的按需资源和活动需要易于访问，清晰映射到课程目标，并在需要时纳入网络会议。此外，随着你在Moodle中开发和制定课程和课程体系，良好的规划非常重要，以确保在组织和展示上保持一定的一致性。不仅你会标准化你的课程体系，你也会标准化你的课程。虽然很容易认为最耀眼的内容或评估应该被展示出来，但现实是你应该将注意力集中在课程学习目标上。你所有的内容和评估都应该直接映射到学习目标上。本章不专注于特定的资源或活动；这些内容将在后面的章节中介绍。我们本章的目标是概述课程中包含的内容以及如何在课程层面进行管理。我们将介绍资源和活动，但不会在后面的章节中详细说明每一个。目前的目标是能够看到整体情况，以便规划你的课程。

- en: '**Representation**: UDL provides strategies for designing a course that has
    materials that can be accessed in many different ways and use different senses.
    For example, if you have an audio recording, make sure to include a text transcript.
    Likewise, if you have a text, make sure that it can be converted to speech through
    an app. Make sure that when you develop your course, you include glossaries for
    specialized vocabulary and symbols and that your presentations are clear. Make
    sure you can promote understanding across languages, perhaps by including a translation
    function. Finally, be sure to use a scaffolding approach and facilitate comprehension
    by providing background knowledge, making it easy for a learner to see the big
    ideas. You can use resources for this such as content files, and you can also
    incorporate "check your knowledge" interactive activities.'

- en: '**Action and expression**: UDL asks you to think about what your learners will
    do when they encounter content or activities. How can you make sure that they
    can navigate easily and accomplish the task, even if they lack physical mobility?
    Also, what if they have low vision or low hearing? How will you make sure they
    have access and that you can make accommodations? Make sure that you build in
    assistive technologies where possible, and provide links to obtain them. Expression
    and communication are important for UDL, and make sure that you accommodate diversity
    and different cultural ways of understanding content. Use multiple media for communication,
    and as you ascend the levels of difficulty with Bloom''s taxonomy, design the
    course so it ascends gradually rather than jumping around between levels of difficulty.
    Finally, help your learners succeed by building in goal-setting activities. You
    can include checklists or a clear set of guidelines. You can build in a framework
    for periodic announcements that help keep students on track. You can build in
    a template for instructors to fill in to help provide supportive tasks, such as
    guides to searching databases in the online library, or quick tips for designing
    discussion prompts that encourage students to share their lived experiences so
    that the virtual classroom is a place of community and supportive attitudes.'

    later in the chapters but to familiarize you with some of the capabilities early
    on, we're mentioning them here. For example, you may want to run the **activity
    completion report**. If you think you will want to use that report, then enable
    the setting for the expected completion date. This does not display the expected
    completion date to the student. You are not setting a due date with this setting.
    Only the teacher will see this date in the activity completion report. If you
    want to tell the student to complete this activity or resource by a specific date,
    you will need to use some other method to do so.

    through a course and that they're ready for the next level is to tie forward progress
    to the successful completion of a section, unit, or module. Be sure to keep the
    overall course design in mind, and also to make sure that the activities and resources
    are in ascending levels as per Bloom's taxonomy. Also, as you're creating your
    course flow, make sure you refer to the course map and the CDD.

    resources and activities and the basics of adding them to a course. You also went
