- en: Living in a world where synchronous web conference delivery is a major part
    of content delivery means that your on-demand resources and activities need to
    be easily accessed, clearly mapped to course objectives, and incorporated into
    a web conference if needed. Further, as you develop your courses and curriculum
    in Moodle, it is important to plan well so that there is a level of consistency
    in an organization and presentation. Not only will you standardize your curriculum
    – you will also standardize your courses. Although it's easy to think that the
    flashiest content or assessment should be showcased, the reality is that you should
    keep your attention focused on the course learning objectives. All your content
    and assessments should map directly to the learning objectives. This chapter does
    not focus on specific resources or activities; that content is covered in later
    chapters. Our goal for this chapter is to provide an overview of the content that
    goes into your course and how to manage it at the course level. We'll introduce
    resources and activities but will not go into detail about each one until later
    chapters. Right now, the goal is to be able to see the big picture in order to
    plan your courses.

- en: In Moodle, course material is either a resource or an activity. A **resource**
    denotes instructional material in the form of digital files used by students.
    They can be viewed, read, listened to, or saved. They can include web pages, links,
    files, graphics, videos, audio, and embedded social media.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An **activity** can include interactive applications, including polls, quizzes,
    assignments, tests, discussion forums, and wikis. They all involve interaction,
    either independently or with other students. Keep in mind that activities are
    interactive, while resources are not. Learners actively engage with activities,
    while resources can be passive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Activities can be assessments, and thus can be graded. Keep in mind that if
    you are developing a course curriculum for a certificate or degree program, you
    will need to ensure that they are presented in a consistent manner. You may wish
    to create a set of guidelines in a **Course Design Document** (**CDD**), which
    you can share with all the instructors and instructional designers/technologists
    that are involved in creating courses or materials for it. The CDD can translate
    to a template, customized for all the courses and the curriculum. Your CDD can
    include your course map, which links the resources and activities to their corresponding
    learning objective.

    plan to incorporate different types of media. Your resources and activities are
    learning objects, which means that you can upload or link to them as objects and
    place them where it is most convenient. If any of your resources require plugins,

    Course goals and learning objectives are often used interchangeably, although
    technically speaking, they should not be. Learning outcomes are statements that
    describe the knowledge or skills students should acquire by the end of a particular
    assignment, class, course, or program, helping students understand why that knowledge
    and those skills will be useful to them.

    in the cognitive domain. Bloom's taxonomy is used to classify educational learning
    objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. First developed in 1948

    the verbs used in describing outcomes and then mapping them to activities.

    materials that can be accessed in many different ways and use different senses.
    For example, if you have an audio recording, make sure to include a text transcript.
    Likewise, if you have a text, make sure that it can be converted to speech through
    an app. Make sure that when you develop your course, you include glossaries for
    specialized vocabulary and symbols and that your presentations are clear. Make
    sure you can promote understanding across languages, perhaps by including a translation
    function. Finally, be sure to use a scaffolding approach and facilitate comprehension
    by providing background knowledge, making it easy for a learner to see the big
    ideas. You can use resources for this such as content files, and you can also
    incorporate "check your knowledge" interactive activities.'
  prefs:

    do when they encounter content or activities. How can you make sure that they
    can navigate easily and accomplish the task, even if they lack physical mobility?
    Also, what if they have low vision or low hearing? How will you make sure they
    have access and that you can make accommodations? Make sure that you build in
    assistive technologies where possible, and provide links to obtain them. Expression
    and communication are important for UDL, and make sure that you accommodate diversity
    and different cultural ways of understanding content. Use multiple media for communication,
    and as you ascend the levels of difficulty with Bloom''s taxonomy, design the
    course so it ascends gradually rather than jumping around between levels of difficulty.
    Finally, help your learners succeed by building in goal-setting activities. You
    can include checklists or a clear set of guidelines. You can build in a framework
    for periodic announcements that help keep students on track. You can build in
    a template for instructors to fill in to help provide supportive tasks, such as
    guides to searching databases in the online library, or quick tips for designing
    discussion prompts that encourage students to share their lived experiences so
    that the virtual classroom is a place of community and supportive attitudes.'

    a student can see this resource. You can use four kinds of conditions – dates,
    grades, user profiles, and customized fields. Restricting access can be a good
    way to ensure that students progress through the course in a way that builds on
    the knowledge they're gaining, and thus sets up effective scaffolding. We will
    examine more specific examples later, but it is a good idea for you to have an
    idea of this functionality now.

    course in a synchronized way so that they are communicating clearly. It is also
    important if you want to motivate students by requiring them to achieve a minimum
    passing score on an assessment in order to progress. When an activity or resource
    is not yet open to a user, you can prevent users from seeing it on the course
    home page. The following example shows the eye icon next to the access condition.
    If the eye icon is open, then the student sees the activity/resource listed on
    the course home page even before the user has access. The activity/resource will
    be displayed in gray type. If the eye icon is closed, the item will be hidden
