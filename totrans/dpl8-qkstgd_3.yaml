    someone who uses the site. If that were all there is to it, if everyone were always
    the same in the *eyes* of Drupal, we could stop right here. So, you won't be surprised
    to read that all users are not necessarily the same. Of course, I'm not referring
    to the personal aspects of the users when I write that; I mean that users are
    not necessarily all the same in terms of their reason for accessing the site and

- en: From the Drupal point of view, it pretty much comes down to what you will be
    allowed to do on the site and whether you require an account to do so. For example,
    some sites allow unknown site visitors to read the content and comment on it.
    Others only allow access to the content for them without commenting, and others
    do not allow anonymous access at all. Returning to the analogy of a home, those
    who can do whatever they like to it have administrative access; those who are
    allowed to enter have authenticated access, albeit with different "roles", such
    as friends versus residents; and those who come to the front door (if there is
    no gatekeeper or doorman preventing that) who are unknown are anonymous.

    content requiring them to be *Authenticated*. *Creative* users are typically *Authenticated*.

    that Drupal does blur the line a bit between a role and a user type, because it
    comes with three roles predefined, and they are the user types mentioned earlier.

- en: The preceding screenshot shows the roles that are predefined in Drupal. I disagree
    with the given description of a role, because it is unclear. The order of operation
    in Drupal is that privileges are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to
    users. We'll discuss that more when we add a user and when we assign some permissions,
    later in this chapter.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For now, let's focus on the default Drupal roles themselves. As I mentioned
    earlier, *anonymous* and *authenticated* are actually more user types than roles,
    but in Drupal they are referred to as roles. When would these three roles, alone,
    be sufficient? One example would be a site where all users with logins can create
    content, and all users that have no login can only view that content. If those
    are the limits to your organizational and site complexity, you can jump ahead
    to the section on *User Creation* if you'd like.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us consider. The anonymous role stands on its own. Why? Because it is defined
    as a user with no account or login, which is to say, a user that is not identified.
    We would not assign the role of *Anonymous* to a user account, because if there
    is an account, the user of it is no longer anonymous. There would be no sense
    in creating different roles for anonymous users, because there would be no user
    accounts to assign those roles. So, that leaves us with the other two roles, and
    we can use those to derive examples.
  id: totrans-26

    The first will be authenticated users in general. That is, users with this role
    will be able to login, and in addition to being able to see the Article and Page
    site content that Anonymous and all users can see, they will be able to see content
    of the Appointment type we defined, as well.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This could be our use of the Authenticated role, since all users logging in
    will have those capabilities at a minimum, but we won't use that role for it.
    Why? Because we have to account for the possibility that later there might be
    the need to have some users who can log in but cannot access appointment data.
    In general, I prefer to leave the predefined roles  unchanged for that reason...use
    them as a model instead, or as is. So, we will call the new role Client.

    example. You have no doubt seen a *Terms and Conditions* link on most sites.
  id: totrans-47

    granted permission to access that content (the Terms and Conditions page). Were
    that permission not granted for your user, the link would probably not be visible.
    Were it still visible, or were you to enter the URL for the page in your browser,
    you would receive a message stating that you have not been granted access to that
    content.
