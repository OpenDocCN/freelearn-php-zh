- en: At the time of writing this book, **Bootstrap** was the most popular project
    on GitHub. Many Web sites and Web applications are built using Bootstrap. Many
    books have been published on the topic, and often experience in using Bootstrap
    is required when Web developers apply for a job. That's why I decided to include
    an Appendix on Bootstrap in this book.

- en: You can download Bootstrap from [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com)
    in more than one flavor. The smallest download is a simple distribution that contains
    all the components you need to deploy systems. The source distribution has the
    same in a subfolder but also contains **docs**, **less**, JavaScript sources,
    (broken down by component), and examples, all of which make great study material.

    them all in the `bootstrap` folder to make it easier to switch releases and to
    maintain a flavor of Foundation as well as Bootstrap on the site.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like Foundation, Bootstrap comes with a grid system that, by default, divides
    your working screen's real estate into 12 columns. Using classes, you specify
    how many columns wide you want every block on the screen to be. There are different
    classes for different sizes; this is Bootstrap's and Foundation's way to make
    responsive design easy and almost transparent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bootstrap and Foundation use different **breakpoints**. With Foundation, small
    means less than 640 px, medium is from 641 px to 1024 px, and large means 1025
    px and higher. There are two optional XL and XXL sizes, like in T-shirts, with
    breakpoints of 1440 px and 1920 px. The last two are commented out; you need to
    activate them if you want to use them.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Bootstrap has four sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg`. Just as two T-shirt manufacturers
    can have different sizes in small, the two frameworks have different sizes as
    well, as the breakpoints are 768 px, 992 px, and 1200 px.'

    The main `button` class is `btn`.

    Foundation, it allows you to create a mobile-first, responsive design site or

    have to customize the styles to our needs—in a separate style sheet, of course.
