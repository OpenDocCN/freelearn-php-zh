			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor897"/>Chapter 9</em>: Collaborating with Wikis and Glossaries</h1>
			<p>Collaboration can be a cornerstone of social constructivism and a place where students truly learn from each other. They can share their insights, set goals and targets, and bring prior learning to their collaborations. In addition, collaborations allow students to develop a body of knowledge or a project plan that can be implemented in the real world.</p>
			<p>One strategy for collaboration is to engage students in activities that require each person to contribute to the final product. Two popular activities are informative wikis and topic-based glossaries. While wiki and glossary activities can be completed individually, they are perfect vehicles for collaboration. The key is to examine the learning objectives and determine how best to implement them. In this chapter, we'll discuss various strategies for getting your students engaged in collaborations and excited about learning from each other.  </p>
			<p>This chapter teaches you how to develop effective collaborative activities that allow you to achieve your learning objectives by adding wikis and glossaries to your course. It is a way to build up social constructivism and implement the theories first developed by psychologist Lev Vygotsky, who discussed how people first learn in a group context and then, later, on an individual level. While such learning happens in any interaction (such as a forum, a workshop, and more), in wikis and glossaries, the focus is on a collaborative end product, so the interactions can be even more focused. These activities enable students to work together and build up a body of knowledge. The resulting collection of knowledge (the completed wikis and glossaries) can be reused by students in future courses. As the course evolves, the wikis and glossaries that past students created can be<a id="_idTextAnchor898"/> retained, edited, referenced, and grown.</p>
			<p>Specifically, in this chapter, we will learn about the following topics: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Determining the best collaborative activity to use with asynchronous, synchronous, and blended Moodle courses</li>
				<li>Aligning glossary and wiki activities with our learning objectives</li>
				<li>Developing glossary activities for collaboration in all kinds of delivery modes </li>
				<li>Developing wiki activities for collaboration in all kinds of delivery modes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this chapter, we will bring together the emerging needs for synchronous, asynchronous, and blended delivery with collaboration, which is a powerful learning strategy. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to use Moodle's wikis and glossaries for effective collaborative learning. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor899"/>Using collaboration as an instructional strategy that replicates today's work environment</h1>
			<p>In our distributed<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> world, where people move from place to place and still communicate with each other and develop work products together, it is necessary to understand how to collaborate productively in a virtual environment. Therefore, there is a pragmatic side to the emphasis on collaboration. Moodle's wiki and glossary activities replicate how people use cloud-based collaboration in the workplace to generate reports, guides, marketing materials, and more. </p>
			<p>While wikis and glossaries are often asynchronous, they can also incorporate synchronous web conferencing. This also replicates today's workplace, making the Moodle classroom even more effective for training people not only in the subject matter but also in new ways of working and learning.  </p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor900"/>We use Moodle precisely <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>for its flexible architecture – a structure that encourages learning from each other. The ability to contribute to glossaries, wikis, and other collaborative activities allows students to contribute knowledge in a way that reinforces and rewards. Thus, it is an instructional strategy that brings together motivation, self-confidence, and curiosity, which creates conditions for learning. Additionally, it is a way to reinforce prior knowledge and build up experience as students recall past learning, add to what they already know, and reflect on what others are contributing. It's also a strategy for overcoming the negative effects of isolation and distance and for rehumanizing the experience of working in isolation, which can be disconcertingly difficult. </p>
			<p>Therefore, collaboration can be a very effective instructional strategy, and glossaries, wikis, and other areas where students can contribute can form the cornerstones of the knowledge and skills that they will demonstrate in the future. As you work through this chapter, please refer to <a href="B17288_13_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1180"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Features for Teachers: Logs, Reports, Guides</em></p>
			<p>too. In that chapter, you will learn how to connect<a id="_idTextAnchor901"/> many different elements in Moodle. We'll start with the glossary activity. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor902"/>Glossary</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> activity is one <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>of the most underrated activities in Moodle. On the surface, a glossary is a list of words and definitions that students can access. However, a course creator allows students to add entries to the glossary. Adding entries transforms the glossary from a static list of vocabulary words into a collaborative tool for learning purposes. It also has an auto-linking feature that means that any time the word is used in the course, it automatically links to the glossary entry:  </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer254" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_9.01_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – Glossary icon&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – Glossary icon</p>
			<p>If your learning objectives require individuals to be able to identify, define, and describe items or phenomena, the <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> activity is ideal. For example, you might have a course on tourism and wish to develop a glossary of terms that are specialized in a specific area; for example, the terms regarding <em class="italic">culture tourism</em>. Students can collaborate and make a customized glossary that can help them during the course and, later, in their careers. </p>
			<p>A text <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>filter, called <strong class="bold">auto-linking</strong>, creates links to the glossary entries in your course. When this is turned on by a site administrator and a word from the <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> activity appears in the course, it's highlighted. Clicking on the word brings up a pop-up window with the word's entry in the glossary. The entry can consist of text, images, media, and links. It is a miniature page devoted to defining and elucidating<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> the glossary term. The auto-linking feature makes collaborative possibilities even richer. For example, students might be assigned specific glossary terms that they will use as the basis of an illustrative paragraph or passage. </p>
			<p>You can use a glossary to build a class directory, a collection of past exam questions, famous quotations, or even an annotated collection of pictures.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at how we enable glossaries and auto-linking in Moodle. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176">E<a id="_idTextAnchor903"/><a id="_idTextAnchor904"/><a id="_idTextAnchor905"/>nabling glossaries and auto-linking</h2>
			<p>Let's start with a bit of administrative <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>housekeeping. Before teachers can set up a glossary assignment, it needs to be enabled on the system. So, please be sure that the site administrator sees this first. There are several places where a site administrator will need to enable <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> and its features.</p>
			<p>When <strong class="bold">Glossary auto-linking</strong> is turned on, a glossary term appears for the course and is linked to its glossary entry. This is what the link looks like:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2 – Auto-linking in the glossary function</p>
			<p>Auto-linking creates links when a glossary term is used in the same course in which the g<a id="_idTextAnchor906"/>lossary is located.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177">En<a id="_idTextAnchor907"/>abling glossaries for your site</h2>
			<p>First, under <strong class="bold">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold">Activity Modules</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage activities</strong>, the site administrator <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>must enable the <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> activity. By default, the <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> activity is enabled on Moodle. Enabling it is only necessary<a id="_idIndexMarker744"/> if you do not see the glossary in the <strong class="bold">Add Resource</strong> or <strong class="bold">Activity...</strong> menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer256" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>After you have enabled<a id="_idIndexMarker745"/> glossaries for the entire site, you can determine <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>what happens with it. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178">Ena<a id="_idTextAnchor908"/><a id="_idTextAnchor909"/><a id="_idTextAnchor910"/>bling auto-linking</h2>
			<p>Glossary auto-linking needs to be <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>enabled in several places at the site, course, and activity level. If you create a glossary term and it's not being auto-linked to your course, check that glossary auto-linking is enabled at the site, course, and activity/resource level. Each of these le<a id="_idTextAnchor911"/>vels will be covered as we proceed.</p>
			<h3>Ena<a id="_idTextAnchor912"/>bling auto-linking for the site</h3>
			<p>Under <strong class="bold">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage filters</strong>, the site <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>administrator can turn on <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>glossary auto-linking:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4: The site administration page showing Filters</p>
			<p>When you see the filter options, click on <strong class="bold">Manage filters</strong>. You will be able to enable glossary auto-linking, as follows: </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5 – The site administration page showing how to turn on Glossary auto-linking</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Disabled</strong> setting removes the teacher's ability to turn on auto-linking in the course. By default, the <strong class="bold">Off, but available</strong> setting turns off auto-linking, but it enables the teacher to turn it on during the course. The <strong class="bold">On</strong> setting turns on auto-linking for all courses on your site.</p>
			<p>In the right-hand column, note that <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>the user has <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>chosen to have auto-linking in the content<strong class="bold"> </strong>of activities and resources. Additionally, you can select <strong class="bold">Content and headings</strong>, which will turn on auto-linking for the content of an activity or resource along with the words in the heading of t<a id="_idTextAnchor913"/>hat activity or resource.</p>
			<h3>Enabl<a id="_idTextAnchor914"/>ing auto-linking for the course</h3>
			<p>If the site-wide setting <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>for auto-linking is set to <strong class="bold">On</strong>, you do not need to enable it at the course level. If the site-wide setting is <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>set to <strong class="bold">Disable</strong>, it's not possible to enable it at the course level. This setting is available and only necessary if the site-wide setting is <strong class="bold">Off, but available</strong>.</p>
			<p>Under<a id="_idTextAnchor915"/> <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Course administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Filters</strong>, the teacher must turn on <strong class="bold">Glossary auto-linking</strong>. If this is disabled, auto-linking will not work for any of the glos<a id="_idTextAnchor916"/>saries within the course.</p>
			<h3>Enabl<a id="_idTextAnchor917"/>ing auto-linking for the activity or resource</h3>
			<p>If you have <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>auto-linking enabled for the <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>site and the <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>course and it's still not working, check the auto-linking setting for the activity or resource that you are in. In the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> menu, look for the administration options for the resource or activity that you are in. Select <strong class="bold">Filters</strong>, and on the filters page, turn on <strong class="bold">Glossary auto-linking</strong>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – Making sure that auto-linking is enabled within the site home page settings</p>
			<p>After you've <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>enabled glossaries on <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>the site, you can start <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>adding individual glossaries that align with the categories or topics covered by your course and are necessary to fulfill the learning objectives.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-179">Adding<a id="_idTextAnchor918"/><a id="_idTextAnchor919"/> and configuring a glossary</h1>
			<p>Now that the site administrator has <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>enabled and configured the <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>glossary activity, you are ready to start adding and configuring a glossary. Add a glossary by clicking on <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> on your course page, and then select <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong>. When the glossary settings page is displayed, you will need to choose the correct setting to create the kind of glossary that you want for your class. Let's look at the settings that are unique to a glossary.</p>
			<p>You will find these settings under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Glossary administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Edit settings</strong>:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180">Global <a id="_idTextAnchor920"/><a id="_idTextAnchor921"/><a id="_idTextAnchor922"/>glossaries versus local glossaries</h2>
			<p>By default, a <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>glossary only applies to the course in which it resides. However, you can choose to make a glossary global. In this case, the <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>words from this glossary will be highlighted and clickable wherever they are on your site. The work done in one course will then become available to all the courses on your site. If your site's subject matter is highly focused, consider using a global glossary. If your site's subject matter is very broad, such as in a university-wide learning site, you should use local glossaries to avoid confusion. For example, imagine that you have a course in chemistry and another in statistics. Both use the word <em class="italic">granular</em>, but chemistry uses the term to indicate a powdered substance, while statistics uses it to indicate a fine level of detail.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Only an administrator can create a glossary in the global glossary. If you only have teacher rights, get an administrator to do this for you.</p>
			<p>You may wish to empower your students to create their own glossaries and glossary terms. In that case, it's good to know about secondary glossaries. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181">Main gl<a id="_idTextAnchor923"/><a id="_idTextAnchor924"/>ossaries versus secondary glossaries</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Glossary type</strong> setting <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>enables you to designate a <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>glossary as either <strong class="bold">Main</strong> or <strong class="bold">Secondary</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Main glossary</strong> setting refers to a glossary that will include terms from other glossaries. The <strong class="bold">Secondary glossary</strong> setting refers to a glossary that stands alone; it does not include terms from any other glossaries. For example, you might have an overall glossary for science terms and standalone glossaries such as physics, chemistry, biology, and geology as secondary glossaries. This is an important distinction when creating collaborative activities if you want the students to be able to add new terms. However, if you want to keep the glossary terms limited to the ones that align with your learning objectives, it's best to avoid secondary glossaries. </p>
			<p>If you want students to be able to add entries to a glossary, you must make it a <strong class="bold">Secondary glossary</strong> type. Only teachers can add terms to a <strong class="bold">Main glossary</strong> type.</p>
			<p>You can export terms from a <strong class="bold">Secondary glossary</strong> type to a <strong class="bold">Main glossary</strong> type, one at a time. So, you can create a secondary glossary that students will add terms to. Then, you and/or the students can export the best terms to the main glossary. Imagine a course with one main glossary and a secondary glossary each time the course is run. The main glossary will become a repository of the best terms added by each class.</p>
			<p>However<a id="_idTextAnchor925"/>, sometimes, you might wish to have entries automatically approved. In that case, you can request Moodle to approve them. We will learn how to do that next. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182">Entries<a id="_idTextAnchor926"/> approved by default</h2>
			<p>If you turn on the setting for <strong class="bold">Approved by default</strong>, as soon as a <a id="_idIndexMarker766"/>student adds an entry to a glossary, this entry will appear in the glossary. If it's turned off, the teacher will need to approve each entry.</p>
			<p>If you turn this setting on and students add entries that you think are inappropriate, you can always delete those entries and turn the setting off.</p>
			<p>If <strong class="bold">Approved by default</strong> is turned off, new terms will await the teacher's approval before being added: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer261" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8 – Configuring entries in the glossary</p>
			<p>If you would like the students to <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>learn from each other by contributing definitions for the same term, you can set Moodle up so that they can contribute terms and then collaborate to come up with a final version. We'll discuss how to do that in an upcoming section. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183">Always a<a id="_idTextAnchor927"/><a id="_idTextAnchor928"/>llow editing and Duplicate entries allowed</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Always allow editing</strong> and <strong class="bold">Duplicate entries allowed</strong> are two <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>separate settings. However, they can work together in an <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>interesting way. </p>
			<p>If you t<a id="_idTextAnchor929"/>urn on <strong class="bold">Always allow editing</strong>, students can edit entries that have already been made. So, if two students have different definitions for a term, they can each contribute their definition to the same entry. In this case, the second student will not need to create a duplicate entry; they can just add their definition to the existing entry.</p>
			<p>If you turn the <strong class="bold">Always allow editing</strong> setting off, consider allowing duplicate entries. Then, if two students have different definitions for the same term, they can each create an entry for that term.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184">A<a id="_idTextAnchor930"/>llowing<a id="_idTextAnchor931"/> comments</h2>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>turn the <strong class="bold">Allow comments on entries</strong> setting on, students and teachers can add comments to a glossary entry. These comments will appear at the bottom of the entry. Comments are visible<a id="_idTextAnchor932"/> to all the readers of the glossary.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185">Automati<a id="_idTextAnchor933"/>cally linking glossary entries</h2>
			<p>If you turn the <strong class="bold">Automatically link glossary entries</strong> setting on, this will not always result in all entries <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>becoming links on your course. Instead, when an entry is created, its editing page will have the opt<a id="_idTextAnchor934"/>ion to turn on auto-linking for that entry.</p>
			<p>As you develop your glossaries, you will need to think about how they will appear on the page. How many do you want to show on a page? Much depends on what the glossary entries are and how you plan to use them for collaboration. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186">Appearan<a id="_idTextAnchor935"/>ce settings</h2>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> section, you will find settings that affect the presentation of the glossary. These settings affect the layout of the glossary page, how many entries are shown on a page, the links that users are given, and more. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor936"/>Outcomes</h2>
			<p>Outcomes, also referred to as "competencies" or "goals," are descriptions of what the student has demonstrated after the completion of the activity or course. </p>
			<p>Moodle 4.0 is flexible and designed to be used for courses in any possible delivery mode. The <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> activity<a id="_idIndexMarker772"/> includes the outcomes, which enable you to indicate if you'll be using the glossary as a class participation activity, a supplement to a face-to-face course, or for team-based collaboration. Remember that to enable outcomes, you'll need to go to <strong class="bold">Site administration</strong> and select <strong class="bold">Advanced features</strong>. Then, click on <strong class="bold">Enable outcomes</strong> and save the changes. To add the course-level outcome, simply click on <strong class="bold">Edit outcomes</strong> from the link in <strong class="bold">Course administration</strong>. Then, click on <strong class="bold">Add a new outcome</strong>. Complete the form, and select <strong class="bold">Save changes</strong>.</p>
			<p>After you've set up the outcomes, you might wish to set up the appearance. Here is the drop-down menu inside the <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> menu: </p>

			<p>To determine the best settings for <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>your situation, experiment with the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Log in as a teacher.</li>
				<li>Create a few glossary entries.</li>
				<li>Open another browser, log in as a student, and open the glossary.</li>
				<li>As a teacher, try different settings within the <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>Each time you change the settings as a student, refresh the <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> page:</li>

			<p>Including outcomes can be a great motivator. Three excellent ways to keep your students on track are to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Connect the glossary to an assignment and include a due date so that it appears in the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> block of the dashboard.</li>
				<li>Manually add a calendar entry for the <strong class="bold">Glossary</strong> activity on specific days when you'd like students to add a glossary entry.</li>
				<li>Enable the <strong class="bold">Check when complete</strong> option in <strong class="bold">Activity completion</strong>, which will show up on the student's dashboard as a <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>completed activity:</li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor940"/>Functionality booster – enabling ratings</h2>
			<p>You can give students the ability to rate <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>glossary entries, just like they can rate forum postings. The question is what do you want students to rate? The glossary entry's clarity, its helpfulness, or your writing skill in creating an entry? You'll need to consider what you want students to rate and create a custom scale that supports that rating. The criteria can align with the learning objectives and the learning plan. For example, they could tie to activities that align with "identify," "describe," and "explain." You can determine who can rate glossary entries, along with what scale to use, on the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer265" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>Note that only the <strong class="bold">Manager</strong>, <strong class="bold">Teacher</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Non-editing teacher</strong> roles can rate the entries in this glossary. In the next step, the teacher modifies the permissions to allow students to rate entries, too.</p>
			<p>The followin<a id="_idTextAnchor941"/>g is the <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>process to allow students to rate glossary entries. It consists of three parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating the rating scale</li>
				<li>Selecting the scale for the glossary</li>
				<li>Giving students permission to use the ratings</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In order to make it possible for the learners to easily rate the entries, it is necessary to create a rating scale. The following steps show you how to create a rating scale:</p>

			<p>On this page, <strong class="bold">Concept</strong> is the term that you will add to the glossary. Keyword(s) are synonyms that are equivalent to a <em class="italic">See also</em> section in an index or dictionary. These terms will link to the same definition as the concept.</p>
			<p>Note that you can add a picture or media file to <strong class="bold">Description</strong> using the icons in the toolbar: <img src="image/icon2.png" alt=""/></p>
			<p>You can also upload these kinds of files as an attachment, which is what this user chose to do.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.18 – The list of settings allows you to import and export glossaries and glossary entries between courses</p>
			<p>You might want to begin a course with a small glossary and let students add to it as they discover new concepts. If you do this, export the beginning glossary so that it is available for the next course. The next time you teach a course, you can choose to export everything from the completed course (except the student information and the glossary). In the new copy, just create a new and blank glossary and import the beginning glossary.</p>
			<p>Also, note that the editing window enables you to include hyperlinks in the definition (via the <img src="image/Icon1.png" alt=""/> icon). This can be used to link to freely available information on the web, such as <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a>.<a id="_idTextAnchor949"/></p>
			<p>A glossary is effective for learning activities, whether individual or collaborative, that center around definitions. In this case, the learning objectives that are satisfied tend to be at the lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy, in the "Remember" category, which is at the base of the pyramid. To be able to satisfy higher-level cognitive skills and demonstrate mastery of the higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy, you can choose a wiki. Moodle has a very robust and flexible wiki that we will explore in the next section. </p>

			<p>The Moodle Wiki module enables students<a id="_idIndexMarker783"/> to collaborate on a group writing project, build a knowledge base, and discuss class topics. Students can also collaborate on developing rating criteria for a competition, a team-led event, or a business plan for a start-up company or organization.</p>
			<p>Here is Moodle 4.0's redesigned Wiki icon: </p>
			<div>

			<p>A<a id="_idTextAnchor951"/>s a wiki is easy to use, interactive, and organized by date, it encourages collaboration among its participants. This makes it a powerful tool to create group knowledge. The key difference between a forum and a wiki is that when users enter a forum, they see a thread devoted to a topic. Each entry is short. Users read through the thread, one entry at a time. The result is that the discussion becomes prominent. In a wiki, users see the end result of the writing. To see the history of the writing, they must select a <strong class="bold">History</strong> tab. The result is that the end result of the writing becomes prominent.</p>
			<p>Older wiki content is never deleted and can be restored. Additionally, wikis can be searched just like other course material. In the following section, we'll look at the settings on the <strong class="bold">Editing <a id="_idTextAnchor952"/>wiki</strong> page and how they affect user experience. There are advantages to using the wiki in Moodle. Collaborating using Google Docs or Teams/Sharepoint is similar in the sense that everyone can contribute. However, if students lose access to the outside platform (Google or Microsoft), they're unable to continue to contribute. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192">U<a id="_idTextAnchor953"/>sing a wiki for student contributions and explanations of a topic</h2>
			<p>A wiki can be used<a id="_idIndexMarker784"/> to help explain a topic. For example, let's say that a course on entrepreneurship is planning to have a start-up competition. It will be useful to include a list of criteria for judging. Additionally, it will be very useful to include a wiki that contains definitions, processes, and procedures. It's a useful tool for instruction<a id="_idIndexMarker785"/> because th<a id="_idTextAnchor954"/>e instructor can provide guidelines and pointers.<a id="_idTextAnchor955"/></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor956"/>Using a wiki to create a list of judging criteria for evaluating a competition</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Shark Tank</em> (or<em class="italic"> Dragon's Den </em>in the UK) is a popular show on television in which entrepreneurs come before a panel<a id="_idIndexMarker786"/> of potential investors and make presentations to entice the panel members to invest. It is an entertaining and informative program, and having <em class="italic">Shark Tank/Dragon's Den</em> as a class project can be equally informative, entertaining, and engaging.</p>
			<p>One good way to plan a student <em class="italic">Shark Tank/Dragon's Den</em> project is to use a wiki. The first step will be to set up a list of judging criteria along with a clear set of guidelines that indicate what is expected in an outstanding <em class="italic">pitch</em> that will convince the investor to put money into the project or start-up company. Then, the students can also share their evaluations of the start-up pitches in the competition:</p>

			<p>There are several<a id="_idIndexMarker788"/> ways to use wikis that focus on a collaborative, actionable project rather than creating a simple<a id="_idIndexMarker789"/> repository of knowledge. In the case of <em class="italic">Shark Tank</em>, one collaborative activity could be to develop a business plan. Another could be to develop a directory of potential financial backers, which could include angels, venture capital firms, private equity firms, and partners who will help commercialize the product.<a id="_idTextAnchor960"/> </p>
			<h3>Event planning</h3>
			<p>A wiki can be used to identify the tasks, roles, and resources<a id="_idIndexMarker790"/> of an event. For example, let's take the task of planning a wedding. There will be many different elements, ranging from the flowers, the decorations during the wedding ceremony, the reception, the catering, the invitations, and more. The wiki can be used to identify the different tasks, and then further define and refine the tasks as they are listed. Following this, the wiki can be taken <a id="_idTextAnchor961"/>one step further and be used for developing<a id="_idIndexMarker791"/> a timeline with action ste<a id="_idTextAnchor962"/>ps.</p>
			<h3>Business plan for a start-up</h3>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, a class<a id="_idIndexMarker792"/> in entrepreneurship that includes a <em class="italic">Shark Tank</em> competition would be the perfect place to have a collaborative business plan. The wiki can contain the following elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Key elements of a business plan</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats</strong> (<strong class="bold">SWOT</strong>) analyses </li>
				<li>Financial projections</li>
				<li>Goals and desired outcomes </li>
				<li>Diagrams of the product</li>
				<li>Materials used to market the products</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor963"/>Using the wiki type and groups mode to determine who can edit a wiki</h2>
			<p>Wiki content is open to editing<a id="_idIndexMarker793"/> by the entire class, a group, the teacher, or a single student. Additionally, the wiki can be available for viewing by the entire class, a group, the teacher, or a single student. Note that the teacher determines who can see and edit the wiki content; the settings differ.</p>
			<p>The settings for who can edit the wiki content are done using the <strong class="bold">Wiki mode</strong> drop-down box.</p>
			<p>The settings for who can simply see the wiki content are done using the <strong class="bold">Groups</strong> mode.</p>
			<p>In this case, the wiki can double as a learning journal, which is a great place for students to develop reflection-based knowledge. Making a wiki editable by only a single student appears to turn the wiki into a personal journal. However, the difference between a single student wiki and a journal is that a journal can be seen only by the student and the teacher. You can keep a single student wiki private, or you can open it to change the settings and make it collaborative<a id="_idIndexMarker794"/> for the st<a id="_idTextAnchor964"/>udent's group or the entire class:</p>

			<p>If there is one wiki for the entire class, then when the first student enters the wiki, that student will see the starting page(s). If that first student edits any page, the next student who enters will see the edited version, and so on. If there is one wiki for each group in the class, each group will get a <em class="italic">fresh</em> wiki with the starting page(s) that you created. Also, if each student gets their own wiki, each student will see their starting pages when they enter their wiki: </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-197">T<a id="_idTextAnchor966"/><a id="_idTextAnchor967"/><a id="_idTextAnchor968"/>he default format</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Default format</strong> setting determines<a id="_idIndexMarker796"/> whether wiki authors use standard wiki markup or HTML code while editing. If you will use the HTML editor for other student activities, setting this to HTML can simplify this activity for your students. They will get familiar with the HTML editor and won't need to learn the wiki markup language. However, if your students are accustomed to wikis, you might want to select <strong class="bold">Creole</strong>. This enables them to use a common wiki markup, which is faster for experienced typists. Creole is a lightweight markup language, aimed at being a common markup language for wikis, enabling and simplifying the transfer of content between different wiki engines. <strong class="bold">NWiki</strong> is a wiki engine based on the SOA paradigm. It is a set of components and services to embed wiki capabilities in any .NET application. </p>
			<p>If you do not select the <strong class="bold">Force</strong> format, then when a student enters the wiki, they will be able to use HTML for editing purposes. After you have created a new wiki, a screen will appear that allows you to start a new page. Take a look at the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer281" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>As you can see, wikis are powerful<a id="_idIndexMarker797"/> and can be utilized in courses that require a group project, presentation, or proposal. The actual collaborative work can be done in both synchronous and asynchronous ways. For example, students can make contributions to the wiki asynchronously and then meet through Moodle's built-in web conferencing, BigBlueButton, or by linking to their own institution's subscribed platforms, such as Zoom or Teams.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor969"/>Functionality booster</h2>
			<p>It is possible to collaborate<a id="_idIndexMarker798"/> using Google Docs, Microsoft Teams, or OneDrive, rather than doing all the collaboration within the glossary or wiki entries. This is highly recommended if several teams are collaborating or if there are different phases of a glossary or wiki entry (for instance, initial, revision, or an annotated bibliography). However, there are disadvantages if people are from different institutions, if they lose access to the outside platform, or if they run out of space there. There can also be security features and firewalls that could impede some users. </p>
			<p>For example, one team could be in charge of posting the initial definitions. They could collaborate in Google Docs and then upload their final document to the glossary or wiki entry. The second team could go in and add references from refereed journals to specific terms. The third could add annotations: </p>
			<p>Team 1: Enter the primary definition.</p>
			<p>Team 2: Add key references from the refereed journals.</p>
			<p>Team 3: Add annotations to the journals.</p>
			<p>Each team would collaborate outside Moodle and then upload the clean, final version to add to the appropriate entries. </p>
			<p>Now that we've taken a look<a id="_idIndexMarker799"/> at how glossaries and wikis work in Moodle, along with how they can blend with the cloud-based platforms that learners and institutions can use, we are ready to move on and work with them.<a id="_idTextAnchor970"/> </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor971"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Moodle offers several options for students to collaborate on building a body of knowledge. For instance, a class can work together to build a glossary that can be imported and reused in future classes. They can work together to write a wiki, which provides an opportunity for them to organize their knowledge into a narrative. Moodle 4.0 is designed for maximum flexibility, and it puts social interaction at the heart of its core philosophy. That means that collaborative wikis and glossaries are perfect activities in Moodle 4.0, and they can be used in conjunction with 100% online activities alongside those that incorporate in-person, face-to-face interactions. </p>
			<p>Both glossaries and wikis are very effective for a combination of synchronous and asynchronous learning. For example, group members can chat with each other as they develop their definitions (glossaries) or collaborative projects (wikis). Additionally, they can schedule synchronous web conferences by integrating and embedding BigBlueButton or linking to an outside platform such as Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams.</p>
			<p>Such engagement is highly motivating, and students will be more likely to stay involved with the course and also learn from each other. Incorporating collaborative glossaries and wikis can also help students feel more confident about learning and take their knowledge easily from coursework to real-world applications.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to use Moodle to run a workshop. In it, we will cover workshops, group projects, combinations of group and individual projects, workshop strategies, and the four phases of a workshop.</p>
