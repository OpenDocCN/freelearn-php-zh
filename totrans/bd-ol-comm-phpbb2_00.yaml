    discussion forums and membership management. Written in the PHP scripting language,
    and making use of the popular MySQL database, phpBB is a standard among web-hosting
    companies throughout the world, and is one of the most widely used bulletin-board
    packages in the world. phpBB short-circuits the need for you to be a web development
    master in order to create and manage massive online communities.

    with the basics of configuring your site, creating forums and users, and introducing

    more ways to customize your forum’s appearance and features. Making these customizations
    is essential to giving your community a unique identity that makes it stand out
    among other online forums. The appearance of a forum is mainly controlled by phpBB’s
    styling system, which manages the colors, images, and visual layout of the forum.
    In this chapter, you will learn about the basics of a phpBB 2.0 style, adding
    and removing styles, fixing common style installation problems, customizing styles,
    and adding new features, including "modifications", to the forum.'

    own template. Creating your own template can be a very interesting process, but
    can also be quite time consuming.*[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Creating Your
    Own Template")* takes you through this process, from designing a new template
    to realizing that design to create a new look for a forum. Starting with a rough
    sketch on paper, we move through all the steps until we have a finished template.

    of your forum. Eventually you may need a feature and find yourself unable to locate
    an existing modification for it! *[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Creating a
    New MOD")* shows you how to create a new modification (also known as a hack) for
    yourself, to help you get that extra feature you are so missing. In this chapter,
    you will start off by learning what modifications are, and the skills and tools
    needed to create a modification. After that, we create a simple modification,
    and show you how to make the modification available to other phpBB users.
