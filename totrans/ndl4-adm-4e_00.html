<h1 id="_idParaDest-5" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Since its launch in 2002, Moodle has become the benchmark that every learning management system is measured against. It has won a wide range of international accolades and established itself as an ecosystem for educational tools <span class="No-Break" lang="">and services.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">There are two versions of Moodle: <strong class="bold" lang="">Moodle LMS</strong> and <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Moodle Workplace</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle LMS is the original version of Moodle, targeted at educational institutions such as schools, colleges, universities, and training providers. Moodle Workplace is designed for corporate and organizational training, resulting in a powerful and flexible platform for <span class="No-Break" lang="">workplace learning.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">While this book covers the administration of Moodle LMS, it can also be used with Moodle Workplace, since the latter is an extension of the former. References to Moodle Workplace and samples will be <span class="No-Break" lang="">provided throughout.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">A fun way to demonstrate the various Moodle subjects is in the form of a tube/subway/metro/underground map, where any icon(ic) stations represent Moodle Workplace-only features (you can download higher-quality versions in multiple languages and up-to-date features <span class="No-Break" lang="">from </span><a href="http://www.openumlaut.com"><span class="No-Break" lang="">www.openumlaut.com</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">):</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure P.1 – Moodle and Moodle Workplace map</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><em class="italic" lang="">Moodle 4 Administration</em> is a complete, practical guide to administering Moodle sites. It covers setting up Moodle, configuration, day-to-day administrative tasks, and advanced options to customize and <span class="No-Break" lang="">extend Moodle.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The author, who has been at the cutting edge of Moodle since its advent, has adopted a problem-solution approach to bring the content in line with your day-to-day operations. The practical examples will help you set up Moodle for large organizations and small <span class="No-Break" lang="">entities alike.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This is a one-stop reference for tasks you will encounter when administering a Moodle site of any shape or size. It not only covers core Moodle functionality but also some third-party tools and add-ons that will increase your flexibility and efficiency even further when dealing with <span class="No-Break" lang="">administrative duties.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The fourth edition of this title has been written from scratch to align with Moodle’s latest version. It has been further augmented with over 120 diagrams, checklists, and workflows. I hope you find its content useful when administering your Moodle system. <span class="No-Break" lang="">Happy Moodling!</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who is this book for</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">This book is written for technicians and systems administrators as well as academic staff – that is, basically anyone who has to administer a Moodle system. Whether you are dealing with a small-scale local Moodle system or a large-scale multi-site <strong class="bold" lang="">Learning Management System</strong> (<strong class="bold" lang="">LMS</strong>), this book will assist you with any <span class="No-Break" lang="">administrative tasks.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Some basic Moodle knowledge would be helpful but is <span class="No-Break" lang="">not essential.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-7" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>LMS job functions</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">A Moodle administrator is an LMS administrator who manages a Moodle system. A quick search through recruitment agencies specializing in the educational sector reveals a growing number of dedicated job titles closely related to LMS administration. A few examples are <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">LMS administrator (or VLE administrator or MLE administrator)</li>
<li lang="en-GB">LMS support officer</li>
<li lang="en-GB">LMS architect</li>
<li lang="en-GB">LMS engineer</li>
<li lang="en-GB">LMS coordinator</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">The list does not include functions that regularly act in an administrative capacity, such as IT support. It also does not include roles in the pedagogical field that often take on the work of an LMS administrator, such as learning technologists or <span class="No-Break" lang="">e-learning coordinators.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">An LMS administrator usually works closely with the staff responsible for IT systems, databases, and networks. It has been proven beneficial to have some basic skills in these areas. Additionally, links with other departments are more likely in larger organizations where content management systems, student information management systems, and other related infrastructure <span class="No-Break" lang="">are present.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Given this growing number of LMS administration-related roles, let’s look at some key obligations of the job functions and what skills are essential <span class="No-Break" lang="">and desirable.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-8" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Obligations and skill sets of an LMS administrator</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The responsibilities of an LMS administrator differ from organization to organization. However, some obligations are common across installations <span class="No-Break" lang="">and setups:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">User management (learners, teachers, and others)</li>
<li lang="en-GB">Course management (prospectus mapping)</li>
<li lang="en-GB">Module management (functionality provided to users)</li>
<li lang="en-GB">Look and feel of the LMS (often carried out by a web designer)</li>
<li lang="en-GB">Year-end maintenance (if applicable)</li>
<li lang="en-GB">Beginning-of-year setup (if applicable)</li>
<li lang="en-GB">Support teaching staff and learners</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">In addition to these generic LMS-specific features, you must ensure that your system is secure, stable, and performs well. Backups have to be in place, monitoring has to be set up, usage reports have to be produced, and regular system maintenance has to be <span class="No-Break" lang="">carried out.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">If you host your own system, you will be responsible for all of the listed tasks and many more. If your LMS is hosted in a managed environment, the hosting provider will carry out some tasks closer to the system level, so it is essential that they have a good understanding of Moodle. Either way, you will be the first person to be contacted by staff and learners if anything goes wrong, if they require new functionality, or if some administrative task has to be <span class="No-Break" lang="">carried out.</span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-10" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Part 1: Getting Started</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">These two initial chapters will get you off the ground. You will learn different techniques on how to install Moodle and how to keep it up to date. You will further familiarize yourself with the Moodle system and its user interface. This part comprises the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following chapters.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><a href="B18779_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor020"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Installing Moodle</em>, tells you about the most suitable Moodle setup for your organization, including software and hardware requirements. You will learn how to install Moodle in a LAMP environment before Moodle update options are covered in detail. Throughout the chapter, you will learn how to perform the described operations using the Moodle <strong class="bold" lang="">Command-Line Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold" lang="">CLI</strong>), Git, and the third-party Moodle <span class="No-Break" lang="">Shell (Moosh).</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><a href="B18779_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Exploring the Moodle System</em>, covers the building blocks of the learning platform. First, we present the Moodle architecture – that is, the main Moodle components – and where its data and code are stored. You will then acquire the skills to find your way around Moodle via its intuitive user and administration interface and where to find help if required. Finally, you will learn how Moodle’s file management works and how to configure the <span class="No-Break" lang="">recycle bin.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-11" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Part 2: Courses, Users, and Roles</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Courses, users, and roles form the backbone of Moodle. You will learn how to manage courses and categories and different options to enrol users in courses. We will then deal with the management of users and cohorts and how to set up different authentication methods. Finally, you will learn how to manage permissions by applying roles and capabilities in different contexts. This part comprises the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following chapters.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><a href="B18779_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor059"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Exploring Courses, Users, and Roles</em>, gives you an overview of Moodle courses, users, and roles.

You will learn how to add custom course fields and deal with course requests. The remainder of the chapter deals with an array of enrolment options, covering Moodle’s internal enrolment (manual, self, and guest), cohort enrolment and synchronization, and database-driven enrolments – for instance, via LDAP, meta courses, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">payment-driven enrolments.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><a href="B18779_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Managing Users, Cohorts, and Authentication</em>, explains how to manage users on your system. We first cover what user profiles look like and how they can be extended before presenting (manual and bulk) standard user actions. We then explain how to add users to Moodle manually – that is, one by one and via batch upload – before dealing with cohorts. Then, we will learn about a plethora of authentication mechanisms that Moodle equips us with. Finally, we will discuss the best practices of <span class="No-Break" lang="">user-naming schemes.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><a href="B18779_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Managing Permissions, Roles, and Capabilities</em>, guides you through permission management. This applies roles and capabilities to users in different contexts.

<h2 id="_idParaDest-14" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Part 5 – Beyond Moodle</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">No Moodle is an island. While many Moodle systems are operated in isolation, there are scenarios where your LMS must cooperate with external entities, whether exchanging data with other systems via web services, connecting disparate Moodle instances, or supporting multiple tenants. This part deals with setting up such topologies and comprises the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following chapters.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><a href="B18779_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor337"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 18</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Integrating External Systems Using Web Services</em>, looks at ways to integrate Moodle with other systems via web services.

<p lang="en-GB"><a href="B18779_Appendix.xhtml#_idTextAnchor369"><em class="italic" lang="">Appendix</em></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Configuration Settings</em>, provides you with a list of parameters that can be modified in Moodle’s configuration file and the impact each of these values will have. The areas covered are administration settings and <span class="No-Break" lang="">system settings.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-15" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">For Moodle, you must have the following components up and running on your server (at the time of writing for <span class="No-Break" lang="">version 4.0):</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Database</strong>: MySQL (version 5.7 or later utilizing the ACID-compliant InnoDB storage engine), PostgreSQL 10+, MariaDB 10.2.29+, Aurora MySQL (on Amazon Web Services), Microsoft SQL Server 2017+, and Oracle 11.2+.</li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Web server</strong>: Apache is the preferred web server option, but Moodle works well with any other web server that supports PHP, such as Microsoft IIS.</li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">PHP</strong> 7.3.0 is the minimum PHP version to run Moodle 4; PHP 7.4.0 is the minimum version from Moodle 4.1 onwards. PHP 8 is also supported.</li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">PHP extensions</strong>: Moodle makes use of a number of PHP extensions, most of which are compiled in PHP by default: <strong class="source-inline" lang="">curl</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">ctype</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">dom</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">fileinfo</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">gd</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">hash</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">iconv</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">intl</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">json</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">mbstring</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">openssl</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">pcre</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">simplexml</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">spl</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">xml</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">xmlreader</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">zip</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline" lang="">zlib</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Depending on your specific setup, additional software might <span class="No-Break" lang="">be required.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">If you don’t have access to the preceding components, ensure that you have full administrator access to a Moodle system. You won’t be able to carry out any system-level operations but will be able to administer Moodle via its web <span class="No-Break" lang="">interface fully.</span></p>
