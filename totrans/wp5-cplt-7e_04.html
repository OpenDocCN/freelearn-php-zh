<p>In the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, you have the ability to manage a number of different types of content and ways of sorting content, including posts, categories, pages, links, media uploads, and more. WordPress uses a similar format for various screens. Let's explore them here.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Lists of items</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Every type of content that can be managed in WordPress has a separate dedicated screen that lists all of the individual content items. Since this chapter is about creating posts, let's see an example of what a list of posts would look like:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5e116d7b-b639-4e67-97a2-a6463d67d836.png" width="1567" height="666"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the name of the content type is at the top (in this case, it's <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span>). The list of the items also has columns with various other info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each item on the list shows its <span class="packt_screen">Title</span>. You can always click on an item title to edit it.</li>
<li>If you hover your mouse over a specific row, as I hovered over <span class="packt_screen">Hello world!</span> in the preceding screenshot, you will see four additional links. The first three are always the same (<span class="packt_screen">Edit</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Quick Edit</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Trash</span>), while the fourth varies between <span class="packt_screen">View</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Preview</span>, depending on whether we're dealing with an already published post or one that's pending. The <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Trash</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">View</span>/<span class="packt_screen">Preview</span> links are pretty self-explanatory, but the <span class="packt_screen">Quick Edit</span> link deserves an additional word. When you click on it, you will see a panel allowing you to perform some simplified editing (just the basic details and parameters, with no actual content editing):</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e60d0880-ff72-457d-8c0c-c62ea2586dbc.png" width="1467" height="362"/></p>
<ul>
<li>You can make changes and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Update</span>, or click on <span class="packt_screen">Cancel</span> if you've changed your mind.</li>
<li>The area above the list of posts lets you choose whether to view <span class="packt_screen">All</span> (posts), <span class="packt_screen">Published</span> (posts), and also <span class="packt_screen">Drafts</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Pending</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Trash</span>. At the moment, I have only <span class="packt_screen">All</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Drafts</span><span>,</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Published</span> posts on my list. Over time, however, the list is bound to get populated some more, as we're going to continue writing new posts (and the same goes for your own site).</li>
<li>Just below those links is the <span class="packt_screen">Bulk Actions</span> menu and its corresponding <span class="packt_screen">Apply</span> button. Choose one or more posts by clicking on their checkboxes (or check the top checkbox to select every item). Then, choose <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Move to Trash</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Bulk Actions</span> menu, and, after clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Apply</span>, you'll be able to bulk delete or bulk edit those posts. Additionally, further down the road, so to speak, when you install some third-party plugins, you'll notice that this <span class="packt_screen">Bulk Actions</span> menu might contain more options on top of the standard two—editing and deleting.</li>
<li>The <em><span class="packt_screen">Filters</span></em> menu lets you choose options from the <span class="packt_screen">Date</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span> pull-down lists, and then clicks on the <span class="packt_screen">Filter</span> button to only show items that meet those criteria.</li>
<li>The search field along with the <span class="packt_screen">Search Posts</span> button provides yet another way of filtering through your posts, to find the specific one you're looking for. This might not seem like a particularly useful feature at first, but once you have more than, say, 200 posts published on the site, finding individual entries becomes quite a challenge.</li>
<li>At the very top is the <span class="packt_screen">Screen Options</span> dropdown. This tab, which appears on every screen on the WordPress dashboard, will allow you to hide or show particular columns, and choose the number of items to show per page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's move on to the main topic of this chapter—posting content.</p>

<p>The central activity you'll be doing with your blog is adding posts. A post is like an article in a magazine; it needs a title, body content, and an author (in this case though, WordPress allows multiple authors to contribute to a blog). A blog post also has a lot of other information attached to it, such as a date, excerpt, tags, and categories. In this section, you will learn how to create a new post and what kind of information to attach to it.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding a simple post</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>Whenever you want to add content or carry out maintenance on your WordPress website, you have to start by logging in to the <strong>WordPress administration panel</strong> (<kbd>wp-admin</kbd>) of your site. To get to the admin panel, open <kbd>https://yoursite.com/wp-admin</kbd> in your web browser.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Remember that if you have installed WordPress in a subdirectory (for example, <kbd>blog</kbd>), then your URL has to include that subdirectory (for example, <kbd>https://yoursite.com/blog/wp-admin</kbd>).</div>
<p>From here, there are two ways to get to the screen that will allow you to add a new post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> from the main sidebar menu of the WordPress dashboard</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">+ New</span> button in the top bar of the WordPress dashboard and then on <span class="packt_screen">Post</span> (refer to the following screenshot):</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you get to the post creation panel, you'll see the main content editor. The next section explains how to use it.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Working in the block-based content editor</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The block-based content editor is the latest and greatest addition to WordPress. The project started its life under the name of <strong>Gutenberg</strong> and was in development for around two years before it was finally included in WordPress 5 as the primary content-editing tool:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b65f08c9-823d-4a90-9a3b-6a731fcb63d8.png" width="1169" height="700"/></p>
<p>What you can see in the preceding screenshot is the main view of the block-based content editor. Also notice the helpful onboarding tips that provide you with assistance during your initial encounter with the new editor.</p>
<p>So why is it called the <em>block-based</em> editor? Because of the way the editor handles content and manages their structure. The content that you have within your posts or pages is divided into individual blocks, one below the other, all arranged neatly on a (digital) canvas.</p>
<p>Before block-based editing, WordPress used a traditional what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor. It used a classic paragraph-based structure—an approach very similar to how you'd build a Google or a Word document. However, such a traditional structure isn't always suited to handle the modern content requirements of the web. In other words, it makes it hard to build elaborate, visually pleasing blog posts or pages and present them effectively on different devices.</p>
<p>Block-based editing makes more sense since each block of content can be treated individually and handled differently depending on the device used to view the content. Moreover, it's easier to rearrange blocks than it is paragraphs.</p>
<p>So what can <em>a block</em> actually be? Think about everything that can be put on a web page. This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks of text</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Quotes</li>
<li>Headings</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Embeds from third-party websites (such as YouTube or Facebook)</li>
<li>And much more </li>
</ul>
<p>The following section of the chapter describes how to use the block-based editor to create your first blog post.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding the editor interface</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The editor (<span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>) consists of three main sections, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/91b08cf5-5b36-4203-953a-5ac26d690fa7.png" style="width:68.17em;height:55.42em;" width="1099" height="893"/></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The main canvas</strong>: This is the main content-editing section where you'll be doing most of your work</li>
<li><strong>The settings sidebar</strong>: This allows you to get more in-depth and fine-tune the whole document as well as the individual blocks of content</li>
<li><strong>The top menu bar</strong>: This is where you can handle various administrative tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a closer view of what's available in the top bar:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cd606f27-8bdf-4df4-9d44-9115f899cb5b.png" style="width:44.00em;height:4.75em;" width="954" height="103"/></p>
<p>We'll review the symbols from the left:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon allows you to add a new block to the document.</li>
<li>The next two are the undo and redo buttons.</li>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">i</span> icon gives you some information on the content structure of the document (including the number of words, headings, paragraphs, and blocks).</li>
<li>The icon with three horizontal bars allows you to navigate between the blocks that are already on the page when editing content; it provides you with shortcut links.</li>
<li>Then, on the right-hand side, you have the <span class="packt_screen">Preview</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> buttons.</li>
<li>Next to them is the <em>gear</em> icon—this toggles the settings sidebar on and off.</li>
<li>Lastly, there's the icon with three vertical dots. This one lets you enable additional on-screen elements that can make your work with the document more straightforward (for example, you can enter the distraction-free mode, focus on one block at a time, view the keyboard shortcuts, and more).</li>
</ul>
<p>I encourage you to experiment with what's available here on your own.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Now that we know what's going on with the block-based editor interface, it's time to start working on our first blog post!</p>
<ol>
<li>To begin, enter a title for your blog post where it says <span class="packt_screen">Add title</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/dc27a82b-26f0-4d23-8087-e5d0969fb645.png" width="953" height="285"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When you have done <span>that</span>, move your mouse cursor one line and start typing your post:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/33ce713e-c4b7-4eec-a10d-29bf61ae1a5b.png" style="width:34.75em;height:9.33em;" width="841" height="225"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you start typing, you'll immediately see that there are various editing tools available now. You can align your text to the left, right, and center. You can use bold or italics, and even add links to your content. To add a bullet list, just press the <em>Enter</em> key on your keyboard and then start the next line with a hyphen (<em>-</em>). It will be converted to a list item automatically.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>To remove a block or perform some other action on it, you can click on the three dots next to the formatting options:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/2eafacd1-334d-4989-bd76-f8156a907ef2.png" width="950" height="480"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Apart from that, as you're editing any block, you can see the specific options available for that block in the settings sidebar on the right. For example, for the paragraph block, you can adjust the font, add a drop cap, change the text color, and perform a couple of advanced modifications, everything as seen in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5a1162c6-06be-4edd-9c8b-5911fa3a3dfe.png" width="1313" height="689"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">With our first paragraph of text on the page, now let's add an image.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>To do that, click on the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon in the top-left corner of the screen. From the drop-down menu, select <span class="packt_screen">Image</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/670d8400-3a66-4755-bb68-d0622522bc3f.png" style="width:28.08em;height:32.83em;" width="558" height="654"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>You will see a new image block added to the page:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/67b9eea7-8589-42aa-8332-334df73c1f31.png" style="width:34.83em;height:18.50em;" width="622" height="330"/></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>That image block allows you to <span class="packt_screen">Upload</span> a new image, select it from the <span class="packt_screen">Media Library</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">insert from a URL</span>. The most common way is to upload a new image from your computer. With that done, you'll see that there are some quite useful options available for images as well. Among other things, you can change the alignment of the image, change its size, add a caption, add a link on the image, and more. Refer to the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a10c036e-cb85-477f-8ac5-9281d1567db7.png" style="width:68.17em;height:40.17em;" width="1304" height="768"/></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Continuing the same approach, we can add all sorts of other blocks onto the canvas, and thus end up with quite a compelling blog post. For example, as an experiment, I created the following blog post:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0daaf2ec-2f12-4576-b22c-34230ee70660.png" style="width:34.75em;height:55.17em;" width="1226" height="1950"/></p>
<p>It consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A standard text paragraph</li>
<li>An image set to wide</li>
<li>One more text paragraph</li>
<li>A bullet list</li>
<li>A pull quote</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have some "building blocks" in place, we'll see how we can work with them to refine our post.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Aligning blocks and building a post layout</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One of the best things about the block-based editor is its versatility and functionality. It's really easy to move things around and fine-tune your blog post up to a point where it looks just perfect.</p>
<p>Adding content blocks one beneath the other—as we've done in the previous step—is just one side of the coin. What's equally impressive is that you can drag and drop the blocks to rearrange them, or use the arrow buttons to move a given block up or down:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/08a9e800-4d13-4eae-bc51-177a4177d041.png" style="width:16.58em;height:10.83em;" width="407" height="265"/></p>
<p>What you see in the preceding screenshot are three icons. They appear as you hover your cursor over a block:</p>
<ul>
<li>The up and down arrows move the current block one position up or down—this provides a great way to switch text and images around, or do any other simple adjustments to the post's layout.</li>
<li>The one button in the middle—the grid of six dots—allows you to use drag-and-drop; just grab onto that icon with your mouse and drag the block wherever you want it in the sequence of blocks that are currently part of the post.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more thing you can do is add new blocks directly below or above another block that's already on the canvas. To do that, hover your cursor close to the top or bottom border of a given block. A new <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon will appear, as seen in the following screenshot. Click that <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon to add a new block exactly where you need it:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cd6405be-04a1-4db3-9880-68ffe0afa1b7.png" style="width:32.67em;height:11.00em;" width="841" height="283"/></p>
<p>When you're ready and you like how your post looks, it's time to publish it. To do that, click the blue <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button in the top-right corner. When you do that, you'll see one final confirmation screen (we will review the other options on this screen in the next section). Click the <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button again, and your post will go live:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/10e2b546-1a74-43fc-ada0-bd374ffbd2cb.png" style="width:19.08em;height:23.75em;" width="459" height="571"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When the process completes, you'll see yourself still on the same screen, but now, the following message will have appeared telling you that your post has been published and that you can see it by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">View Post</span> link:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c908c193-7fc9-4989-b93d-1482ad177c57.png" style="width:14.58em;height:12.50em;" width="543" height="462"/></p>
<p>If you view the front page of your site, you'll see that your new post has been added at the top.</p>

<p>Now that we've reviewed the basics of creating a post, let's look at some of the other options available when adding a new post or editing an existing one. In this section, we'll look at the most commonly used options and, in the next section, we'll look at the more advanced ones.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Categories and tags</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Categories and tags are two types of information that you can add to a blog post. We use them to organize the information in your blog by topic and content (rather than just by date) and to help visitors find what they are looking for on your blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Categories</span> are primarily used for structural organizing. They can be hierarchical, meaning a category can be a parent of another category. A relatively busy blog will probably have at least 10 categories, but probably no more than 15 or 20. Each post in such a blog is likely to have between one and four categories assigned to it. Of course, the numbers mentioned are just suggestions; you can create and assign as many categories as you like. For example, a blog about food and cooking might have these categories: <span class="packt_screen">Recipes</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Food Talk</span>, <span class="packt_screen">In The Media</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Ingredients</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Restaurants</span>. The way you structure your categories is entirely up to you as well. There are no real rules regarding this in the WordPress world, just guidelines like these.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tags</span> are primarily used as shorthand for describing the topics covered in a particular blog post. A relatively busy blog will have anywhere from 15 to even 100 tags in use. Each post in that blog is likely to have three to 10 tags assigned to it. For example, a post on a food blog about a recipe for butternut squash soup may have these tags: <em>soup</em>, <em>vegetarian</em>, <em>autumn</em>, <em>hot</em>, and <em>easy</em>. Again, you can create and assign as many tags as you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>To demonstrate how this all works, let's add a new post to the blog. After giving it a title and some content, let's proceed to assign some new tags. To add tags, look at the settings sidebar in the block-based editor and switch the tab to <span class="packt_screen">Document</span>. From there, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Tags</span> toggle to enable it, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a3a2a2a6-4896-43bd-b464-70ec7824b0f0.png" style="width:44.08em;height:17.17em;" width="1128" height="439"/></p>
<p>Adding <span class="packt_screen">Tags</span> couldn't be easier; just type your list of tags into the empty box. Separate them with commas to define where one tag ends and another begins. The tags will be assigned automatically as you type them in. If you want to remove a tag, click on the <span class="packt_screen">x</span> icon next to it, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/26c0115a-7ee3-41bc-b700-804d24b1bea6.png" style="width:14.33em;height:10.58em;" width="250" height="186"/></p>
<p>Each tag you assign using this method will be added to your blog's catalog of tags. The next time you'll start typing in the same tag, WordPress will autosuggest it.</p>
<p>Categories work a bit differently to tags. Once you get your blog going, you'll usually just check the boxes next to existing categories in the <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span> section of the settings sidebar. When you're just getting started with your first categories, however, you need to create them by hand. To add a new category, look at the same settings sidebar in the block-based editor, switch the tab to <span class="packt_screen">Document</span>, and then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span> toggle to enable it:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f73e8c18-0dc6-4337-9ecd-7d3161473683.png" style="width:13.58em;height:18.42em;" width="258" height="352"/></p>
<p>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add New Category</span> link. Type your category into the text field, and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add New Category</span> button. Your new category will show up on the list, already checked, just like in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9024adf1-955d-40b1-acbb-cf63cba38903.png" style="width:14.08em;height:22.00em;" width="255" height="397"/></p>
<p>Categories and tags don't just help organize the posts on your blog. They serve an additional important purpose: search engine optimization. To increase the likelihood of your posts showing up for relevant online searches, thereby increasing the visits and views to your website, selecting the right categories and tags will help immensely. </p>

<p>WordPress makes it easy to add an image to your post, control default image sizes, make minor edits to that image, and designate a <em>featured</em> image for your post.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding an image to a post</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Earlier in this chapter, we learned how to add a simple image to a blog post. Let's now expand on that a bit more.</p>
<p>There are two main methods of adding an image to a blog post (of which we already know the first one):</p>
<ul>
<li>Either click on the + button in the top bar of the block-based editor,</li>
<li>Or click on the image icon that's on the right-hand side of the last empty content block on the canvas, as seen in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cf1ac6d8-c305-4d08-a2f8-1cc17dd03933.png" style="width:31.67em;height:9.83em;" width="988" height="308"/></p>
<p>At this point, all you need to do in order to add an image to a post is either select it from the <span class="packt_screen">Media Library</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Upload</span> from your computer, or <span class="packt_screen">insert from URL</span>. There are corresponding buttons for each of these methods. Additionally, you can drag and drop an image straight from your desktop.</p>
<p>Once your image finishes uploading, you'll see it added onto the post's canvas. At this stage, you can customize it some more by taking advantage of the options available in the image's pop-up menu, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3a693a46-e698-4b79-b778-1cb9a62eda0d.png" style="width:33.08em;height:11.00em;" width="505" height="168"/></p>
<p>Starting from the left, we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change block type. This button lets you transform your image block to a gallery block, cover block, file block, or media and text block. Essentially, this feature is meant to show you other similar block types that might be more suited for the type of content you want to add. I encourage you to experiment with those to see what's possible.</li>
<li>The next section of five icons is for tuning the image's alignment. The options available are align left, center, right, wide, and full width. While left, right, and center are pretty self-explanatory, the appearance o<em>f</em> wide <em>and</em> full <em>width</em> depends on the theme you're currently using. Go ahead and experiment with those options to see what the effect is.</li>
<li>The pencil icon allows for more in-depth editing of your image. Upon clicking it, you'll see the following screen:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/bb0fe8df-37c0-42d1-b8fb-5cc1fbcb4198.png" style="width:43.83em;height:34.42em;" width="1016" height="798"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The more important fields available here are <span class="packt_screen">Title</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Alt Text</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Caption</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Alt Text</span> is a phrase that's going to appear instead of the image in case the file goes missing, or any other problems present themselves. <span class="packt_screen">Caption</span> is a short description that you want to have displayed beneath the image itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>The last icon—the three vertical dots—is an icon that appears with all other content blocks as well, and it's not unique to the image block. It gives you additional options for what you can do with the block:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c18010c7-05a1-48b1-be66-6eba6b75ceb9.png" style="width:39.92em;height:27.00em;" width="840" height="567"/></p>
<p>Additionally, if you want to, you can also write the caption for your image beneath the image itself, via a standard input box:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/76c043e2-fbef-423c-86d0-57969dfac9e3.png" style="width:36.75em;height:10.75em;" width="778" height="228"/></p>
<p>Remember that in order to save all the changes, you must save the post itself, either by clicking on the main <span class="packt_screen">Publish...</span> button (but this will mean the changes get saved and go live too) or the <span class="packt_screen">Save Draft</span> link that's next to it.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Designating a featured image</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Another cool thing about WordPress—if we didn't have enough of those already—is that you can choose any single image as the featured image for a given blog post. For that purpose, you want to pick an image that represents the post well.</p>
<p>Some themes will make use of the featured images and display them prominently, while some will not. The default theme, the one we've been using, <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span>, uses the featured image to create a great-looking, full-width bar right above the main content of the post. Depending on the theme you're using, its behavior with featured images can vary; but in general, every modern theme supports them in one way or another.</p>
<p>In order to set a featured image, once again look at the options available in the settings sidebar of the block-based editor. Upon switching to the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab, scroll down to the <span class="packt_screen">Featured Image</span> section. There's a single button there labeled <span class="packt_screen">Set featured image</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b3964c87-cbd6-46ab-a5c8-b6de20645049.png" style="width:25.33em;height:30.17em;" width="376" height="450"/></p>
<p>When you click on it, you'll see a pop-up window, very similar to the one we used when adding images to a blog post. Here, you can either upload an entirely new image or select an existing image by clicking on it. All you have to do now is click on the <span class="packt_screen">Select</span> button in the bottom-right corner. With that done, you'll see the image appear in the <span class="packt_screen">Featured Image</span> section of the settings sidebar. However, seeing it there is just for your confirmation that the image was indeed appropriately assigned.</p>
<p>To see it in its full glory, you'll need to navigate to the frontend of your site and see the post in question like a reader would. Look at the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/05d1c307-bb67-4d24-9c82-2d5a0bfa3e38.png" style="width:44.17em;height:21.83em;" width="1893" height="935"/></p>
<p><span>This a great example of a featured image in a live post. Remember, the impact of the featured image will be dictated by the theme of your blog.</span></p>

<p>Whenever you upload an image, WordPress provided three options for resizing of the image (aside from <span>retaining its original size)</span>: <span class="packt_screen">Thumbnail size</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Medium size</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Large size</span>. You can set the pixel dimensions of these options by going into <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Media</span> from the main sidebar menu of the WordPress dashboard. This will take you to the <span class="packt_screen">Media Settings</span> page:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c696c995-6d37-4825-bd6a-fe44d50c3927.png" style="width:45.00em;height:39.67em;" width="1026" height="904"/></p>
<p>Here, you can specify the size of the uploaded images for the three resizing options we just discussed.</p>
<p>If you change the dimensions on this page and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save Changes</span> button, only the images you upload in the future will be affected. The images you've already uploaded to the site will stay at their original/previous thumbnail, medium, and large versions.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to decide what you want your three media sizes to be early on in your site's lifespan, so you can set them and have them applied to all images, right from the outset.</p>

<p>Every image that has been previously uploaded to WordPress can be edited. In order to do that, go to the <span class="packt_screen">Media Library</span> by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Media</span> button in the main sidebar. What you'll see is a new kind of listing, introduced in one of the latest versions of WordPress.</p>
<p>Instead of a traditional list, what you get to work with now is a grid-based archive that gives each piece of media much better visibility. Right now, we only have one image in the library (see screenshot); but as you continue working with your site, the list will become much more impressive.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/27cbe497-83d5-452c-9a07-aaffa6a69f37.png" style="width:41.75em;height:19.83em;" width="790" height="375"/></p>
<p>When you click on any of the images and then on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit Image</span> button at the bottom of the pop-up window that's going to appear, you'll enter the <span class="packt_screen">Attachment Details</span> screen. Here, you can perform a number of operations to make your image just perfect.</p>
<p>As it turns out, WordPress does a sufficiently good job of simple image tune-up so that you don't really need expensive software such as Adobe Photoshop for this. Among the possibilities, you'll find the option of cropping, rotating, scaling, and flipping vertically and horizontally (as shown):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9a5a9ac0-c8b7-4e8f-9a39-b838f6cdcac3.png" style="width:44.08em;height:46.08em;" width="880" height="920"/></p>
<p>For example, you can use your mouse to draw a box, as I have done in the preceding screenshot. On the right, in the box labeled <span class="packt_screen">Image CROP</span>, you'll see the pixel dimensions of your selection. Click on the crop icon (top left), then the <span class="packt_screen">Thumbnail</span> radio button (on the right), and then <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> (just after your photo). You now have a new thumbnail!</p>
<p>Of course, you can adjust any other version of your image just by making a different selection before hitting the <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button. Play around a little until you become familiar with the details.</p>

<p>These days, the newest versions of WordPress are capable of not only including images in our blog posts but other types of media too, such as audio files and videos.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding videos to blog posts</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Luckily for us, the process of adding a video to a standard blog post or page has been made more than easy. Let's discuss this step by step.</p>
<p>We'will create a whole new post for this. Let's use the title <em>Great Baby Back Ribs Recipe</em>. Creating the post itself is pretty basic.</p>
<p>1. Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>. You'll see a screen that we've already covered earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>2. Let's put some example content in place, and try including a video right away. All we need to do is copy and paste the URL of the video that we'd like to include in the content; just a standard copy-and-paste operation, and nothing else.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">When copying the URL of the video, it's important to make sure that the link is copied as is in raw text form (not hyperlinked anywhere: that is, not clickable).</div>
<p>The example I'm going to use here is the video at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDyHbTxTL-A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDyHbTxTL-A</a>. As you would have guessed, it's a nice video recipe for some baby back ribs! So, in order to include this video in a blog post, all I need to do is take its URL and just paste it in. Here is the raw text content of the new post that I'm working on now:</p>
<pre>Here's a great video recipe for some killer baby back ribs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDyHbTxTL-A</pre>
<p>However, something you'll notice right away as you're adding the video URL is that it's going to be turned into a live video block automatically. This will happen both on the front page of the website and even on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit Post</span> screen itself. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/480a8c33-5eb9-4cdf-822f-97d0240da28d.png" style="width:41.08em;height:30.83em;" width="884" height="664"/></p>
<p>3. To give the post some more unique presence, let's add a new category, <em><span class="packt_screen">Recipes</span></em>, and assign a new tag, <em><span class="packt_screen">video</span></em>. After that, all we need to do is publish the post normally.</p>
<p>The process described here explains how to embed YouTube videos and make them a part of your blog posts, but the same goes for other popular platforms too, such as Vimeo, TED, Hulu, and WordPress.tv. To get the full list of supported platforms, please visit <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds</a>.</p>
<p>One more method of adding videos to blog posts is uploading the raw video files manually (instead of using a third-party platform such as YouTube). Even though this is possible in WordPress, it's not a recommended solution. Video files are always quite large in size, and having them hosted on your standard web server can become very expensive (bandwidth costs) should the video become popular and end up being viewed by thousands of people. It's a lot more efficient and user-friendly to just upload your video to YouTube or a similar platform, and then have it embedded on your site, like we just did.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>WordPress also makes adding audio to your blog posts just as easy as adding video. To demonstrate this, I'm going to create an entirely new post and call it, <span class="packt_screen">Risotto Podcast</span>. In it, I'm going to share an episode of a popular cooking-related podcast. I have two ways of doing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much like with videos, if I have a direct URL of the audio file, I can copy and paste it straight into the post.</li>
<li>If what I have instead is the actual audio file on my desktop, I can upload it using the <span class="packt_screen">Audio</span> <span>block of the block-based editor. Here's what that block looks like once added to the post:</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f3f513d6-483c-47ba-b829-a1299c02cdad.png" style="width:43.33em;height:27.75em;" width="916" height="588"/></p>
<p>All I need to do now is select the audio file from my desktop. Once the upload finishes, WordPress will display a live audio player right there on the canvas:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/17266fea-8cd8-4a58-b52d-68083dcdb11d.png" style="width:39.08em;height:18.17em;" width="917" height="427"/></p>
<p>Apart from uploading your audio files directly, you can also embed them from third-party platforms. WordPress supports embeds from SoundCloud, Spotify, Rdio, and a bunch of other services. Again, to get the full list of supported platforms, feel free to visit <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike with images, WordPress doesn't really give us any editing possibilities when it comes to audio and video. It's understandable that images can be manipulated in a lot of ways, for example, they can be rotated, cropped, and scaled. However, there's no such possibility with videos in WordPress. Once a video file or audio file is uploaded, we can't alter it in any way. We can only take it and display it on our sites as is.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>As we've discussed, WordPress comes with a new block-based editor that's meant to make creating web pages easier for most users, even if they have no prior experience with website management. However, if you are comfortable with coding and HTML, you might want to take a peek into the code editor that's available in WordPress as well. This can be particularly useful if you want to add special content or styling that's not otherwise possible to achieve using the block-based editor.</p>
<p>To switch from the visual editor to the code editor, click on the three dots that are in the top-right corner of the screen when editing a post, and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Code Editor</span>. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3b2cfedd-728d-4be1-b238-8f1d70eeeb76.png" style="width:36.00em;height:35.50em;" width="608" height="600"/></p>
<p>You'll see the post you're currently editing in all its raw HTML glory. Just to give you an example, here's what one of the initial posts created for this book looks like when viewed in the <span class="packt_screen">Code Editor</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e6937688-bd80-40a4-9392-31985b96607f.png" style="width:43.25em;height:35.08em;" width="870" height="707"/></p>
<p><span>Although this panel lets you do whatever you wish, you also need to be careful not to break the HTML structure of the document. For this reason, it's perhaps not a good idea to get into these sorts of modifications until you get a basic understanding of how an HTML document is structured.</span></p>

<p>One of the many interesting publishing features WordPress has to offer is the concept of the lead and the body of the post. This may sound like a strange thing, but it's actually quite simple.</p>
<p>When you're publishing a new post, you don't necessarily want to display its whole content right away on the front page. A much more user-friendly approach is to display only the <em>lead</em>, and then display the complete post under its individual URL.</p>
<p>Achieving this in WordPress is very simple. All you need to do is use the <span class="packt_screen">More</span> block available in the block-based editor. Simply add it onto the canvas and then drag and drop it somewhere near the top of the post—preferably right after the first paragraph. See the following screenshot for reference:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/34da6245-0010-49dd-bcec-7a6d3e64a001.png" style="width:46.25em;height:27.67em;" width="1151" height="689"/></p>
<p>On the front page, most WordPress themes display such posts by presenting the lead along with a continue reading link, and then the whole post (both the lead and the remainder of the post) is displayed under the post's individual URL.</p>

<p>WordPress gives you the option to save a draft of your post. The term is quite explanatory. It means you don't have to publish your post right away, but you can still retain your progress and pick up right where you left off.</p>
<p>If you're working on a new post, the good news is that WordPress will save your progress automatically. Generally speaking, if you can see the <span class="packt_screen">Saved</span> badge in the top-right corner of the editing panel (next screenshot), then it means that all your progress up to this point has been saved: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6a13a464-9fd5-4fea-98d8-b90eb59e6fc0.png" style="width:31.75em;height:16.83em;" width="672" height="356"/></p>

<p>Pending articles is a functionality that's going to be a lot more helpful to users working on multi-author blogs. In a bigger publishing structure, there are multiple individuals responsible for different areas of the publishing process. WordPress, being a quality tool, supports such a structure by providing a way to save articles as <span class="packt_screen">Pending Review</span>. In an editor-author relationship, if an editor sees a post labeled <span class="packt_screen">Pending Review</span>, they know that they should have a look at it and prepare it for publication.</p>
<p>When working on a post, switch to the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab in the settings sidebar and then check the box where it says <span class="packt_screen">Pending Review</span>. Next, click on the link labeled <span class="packt_screen">Save as Pending</span> that is going to appear next to the <span class="packt_screen">Preview</span> button. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>

<p>With that done, you have a shiny new article that is now pending review.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>WordPress also lets you alter the timestamp of any given post. This is useful if you are writing a post today that you wish could have been published yesterday, or if you're writing a post in advance and don't want it to show up until the right day.</p>
<p>By default, the timestamp will be set to the present time. To change that, click on the main <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button and then do the necessary changes in the box responsible for handling the publication date. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/37466c1f-ddd5-4eaa-901a-a460f5bdd22f.png" style="width:19.42em;height:41.08em;" width="412" height="872"/></p>
<p>Once you set the date you want, the main <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button might change its label to <span class="packt_screen">Schedule</span> (if you're scheduling a post to be published at a later date). Click that button to save your changes.</p>

<p>By now, you have a handle on the most common and simple options for posts, and you may be wondering about some of the other things worth doing when working on a blog post. We'll cover them all in this part of the chapter.</p>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Excerpt</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Excerpts can be shown in various places throughout your website. The exact ways in which they're used depends on the theme that you have active on the site. Most commonly, themes will display a post's excerpt in place of the lead (described earlier in this chapter), which is taken from the body of the post. Effectively, excerpts provide you with yet another way to summarize the content of your post and use that text instead of what's taken automatically from the body of the post itself.</p>
<p>To edit a post's excerpt, switch to the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab of the settings sidebar and scroll down to the <span class="packt_screen">Excerpt</span> section (as can be seen in the following screenshot). There, you can write a short excerpt, usually best kept to a single paragraph of not more than three lines:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c27ada4f-c910-4642-8bb7-c1de0cf9db09.png" style="width:21.92em;height:39.92em;" width="413" height="753"/></p>
<p>With that being said, it's worth pointing out that entering the excerpt is optional. However, it is advisable that you do take advantage of this possibility. Excerpts can introduce big readability improvements to your site, and make your content easier to grasp for the reader—provided that your current theme does use excerpts in one way or another. In some cases, excerpts also give your site additional SEO benefits—provided that your theme displays them in places where Google and the other search engines can see them.</p>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Discussion</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Another useful section that you can find inside the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab of the settings sidebar is <span class="packt_screen">Discussion</span>. It is where you can set how you want to handle community interaction for the post you're currently working on.</p>
<p>There are two checkboxes available: one for allowing comments and the other for trackbacks and pingbacks. Both these checkboxes will probably be checked by default. You have to uncheck them if you want to turn off the comments or trackbacks and pingbacks for the post:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ee7991c2-bbf3-4a4d-a74c-5e433b03caa2.png" style="width:22.75em;height:9.83em;" width="388" height="168"/></p>
<p>If you uncheck the <span class="packt_screen">Allow Comments</span> box, visitors will not be able to comment on that given blog post. If you uncheck the <span class="packt_screen">Allow Pingbacks &amp; Trackbacks</span> box, something a bit more complicated happens, and you won't see its effect right away. With that box unchecked, when other people mention and link to your blog post from their own websites, your blog won't recognize that fact. If the box stays checked, other people's pingbacks (mentions) will show up under your post along with the other comments.</p>
<p>If you want either or both of these boxes to be unchecked by default, go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>, and then <span class="packt_screen">Discussion</span> from the main left sidebar of the WordPress dashboard. You can uncheck either, or both, of the boxes labeled allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles and allow people to post comments on new articles.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Originally, the trackback and pingback functionality was meant to provide you with a way to communicate with other websites—to let them know that you've published a post mentioning them, or vice versa, in one way or the other (usually through a link). Nowadays, however, trackbacks and pingbacks are becoming somewhat out of date and most bloggers don't even bother to check the trackbacks/pingbacks that they're receiving. For what it's worth, you can probably safely ignore trackbacks and pingbacks entirely. The decision of to whether or not to support them on your site is entirely up to you.</div>
<p>If you want to learn more about trackbacks and pingbacks, you can go to the codex at <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Trackbacks">https://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Trackbacks</a> and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Pingbacks">https://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Pingbacks</a>.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Working with post revisions</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Apart from many content-formatting features, WordPress also allows some basic version control for your posts. What this means is that WordPress keeps every subversion of all your posts. Or in plain English, every time you press the <span class="packt_screen">Update</span> button, instead of overwriting the previous version of the post, WordPress creates a completely new one and still stores the old version safely in the database.</p>
<p>Although this feature doesn't seem like the most useful one at first, it's actually very important for sites where the content is managed by more than one person. In such a scenario, it's easy to get the newest versions of the posts mixed up, so it's always good to have the possibility to return to the previous one.</p>
<p>Once again, we're going to find the revisions by looking into the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab of the settings sidebar. There's a section labeled <span class="packt_screen">Revisions</span> there, along with a number corresponding to how many actual revisions there are for the post you're currently editing:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e58cf2af-2665-45a3-a7fe-e129da1d5028.png" style="width:24.83em;height:26.58em;" width="384" height="409"/></p>
<p>If you click on this label, you will be taken to a page where you can compare individual revisions, and then restore the one you want to work with from now on. The interface provides the main slider that can be used to select individual revisions of the post. This is visible in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/fab60e9f-62b4-4548-b275-a8751d3b53f3.png" style="width:47.67em;height:37.42em;" width="1123" height="880"/></p>
<p>The revision functionality has two main versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is when the <span class="packt_screen">Compare any two revisions</span> box isn't checked, and it lets you compare the revision that's currently selected (on the slider) to the revision directly preceding it.</li>
<li>The second version is when the <span class="packt_screen">Compare any two revisions</span> box is checked. In this case, you can select the revisions you want to compare individually, which essentially allows you to compare any two revisions, just like the box suggests. The revision on the left is always the <em>previous</em> revision, while the one on the right is the next or <em>current</em> one (visible in the preceding screenshot). Every paragraph where a difference is established will be highlighted in red and green, and every individual difference will have additional highlighting. Clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Restore This Revision</span> button will restore the revision on the right, and you will be brought back to the post-editing screen automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel that revisions won't be of any particular use to your site, then you can simply choose to not pay attention to the <span class="packt_screen">Revisions</span> box. When you work with your content normally, not worrying about the revisions, WordPress will always display the most recent versions of your posts by default.</p>

<p>This is a very basic, yet useful, feature in WordPress. Every post and page in WordPress has an author, which is quite obvious in itself. However, if you want, you can change the assigned author of any given entry. In order to do it, look at the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab of the settings sidebar, and locate the <span class="packt_screen">Author</span> label. There's a drop-down menu next to it that lists every user account on your site. Just select a new author, and click on the main <span class="packt_screen">Update</span> button to save the changes:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e08d1306-e371-471e-b664-bea9ec7a2102.png" style="width:19.92em;height:17.83em;" width="498" height="445"/></p>
<p>Note: If you only have one user on your site, then the box won't even be visible.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>WordPress gives you the option to hide posts. You can hide a post from everyone but yourself by marking it <span class="packt_screen">Private</span> (although the user roles of admin and editor will still see it), or you can hide it from everyone, apart from the people with whom you share a password, by marking it <span class="packt_screen">Password Protected</span>.</p>
<p>To implement this, look at the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab of the settings sidebar, and locate the <span class="packt_screen">Visibility</span> label. Next to it, there's a link that says <span class="packt_screen">Public</span>. Once you click on it, you'll see the available options:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/09827a24-80f7-4142-bf67-bb2ca98a1bea.png" style="width:21.92em;height:30.50em;" width="501" height="699"/></p>
<p>If you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Private</span> radio button, the post will not show up on the blog at all, unless it's viewed by someone with the role of admin or editor. If you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Password Protected</span> radio button, you'll get a box where you can type in a password. Visitors to your blog will see the post title along with a note that they have to type in the password to read the rest of the post.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Pretty post permalink</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We've already talked about tuning the permalinks settings of your site in <a href="2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml">Chapter 2</a><em>, Getting Started with WordPress</em>. Now is a good moment to expand on this knowledge and discuss a little something called the <em>post permalink</em>, or <em>slug</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most accurate definitions of what a post slug is comes from the WordPress Codex itself. The resource provided at <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post_Slug">https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post_Slug</a> teaches us that the post slug is made from a few lowercase words separated by dashes, describing a post and usually derived from the post title to create a user-friendly permalink.</p>
<p>In other words, the post slug is what comes after your domain name in the post's URL. For example, my post about my top three favorite dishes uses this URL: <kbd>http://localhost/my-top-3-favorite-dishes/</kbd>, where the last part —<kbd>my-top-3-favorite-dishes</kbd>, is the slug. Just like the official definition says, WordPress chooses the slug by taking my post title, making it all lowercase, removing all punctuation, and replacing spaces with dashes. If I'd prefer it to be something else, such as <kbd>3-favorite-dishes</kbd>, I can change it by going to the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab of the settings sidebar and looking for the section labeled <span class="packt_screen">Permalink</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/300c9c49-130a-4ec0-9035-919a7a823df1.png" style="width:16.83em;height:22.67em;" width="359" height="484"/></p>
<p>Readable URLs are something that Google Search loves, so using them helps to optimize your site for the search engines. It also helps users to figure out what a post is about before clicking on the URL.</p>

<p>Comments are an important element for most blogs. While only you and your authors can write new posts for your blog, your visitors can add comments under those posts. This can fuel a sense of community within a blog, allow people to give you feedback on your writing, and give your visitors a way to help or talk to other visitors.</p>

<p>If you look at the front page of your blog, you'll notice that every post has a link that says <span class="packt_screen">Leave a comment</span> (provided that you didn't disable comments entirely). Clicking on that link will take you to the bottom of the post page, which is where comments can be added.</p>
<p>If you're logged into the WordPress dashboard, you'll see your name and a space to write your comment. If you're not logged in, you'll see a comment form that any other visitor will see. This form includes fields to fill in a name, email, website, and, of course, a big box for the comment itself:</p>

<p>Once you type in the required information and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Post Comment</span> button, the comment will be entered into the WordPress database. How soon it shows up on the site depends on your discussion settings.</p>

<p>In the preceding screenshot, notice that the <span class="packt_screen">Name*</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Email*</span> fields are both marked as required (<span class="packt_screen">*</span>). As the owner of the blog/site, you can change the requirements for comments. This can be done when you go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Discussion</span> in the WordPress dashboard.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Submission, notification, and moderation settings</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's focus on the checkboxes on the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Discussion</span> page that relate to submission, notification, and moderation. The boxes that are checked on this page will determine how much moderation and checking a comment has to go through before it gets posted on the blog.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the settings that have to do with moderation visible under<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Before a comment appears</span>. These two options have to do with the circumstances that allow comments to appear on the site:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/abfca07c-f1f7-457b-a68a-5ba9b1cc2c26.png" style="width:44.50em;height:4.25em;" width="995" height="95"/></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Comment must be manually approved</span>: If this box is checked, every comment has to be manually approved by you before it appears on the site.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Comment author must have a previously approved comment</span>: If you uncheck the box above this, but check this one, then you've relaxed your settings a little bit. This means that if the person commenting has commented before and had his or her comment approved, then the person's future comments don't have to be verified by you—they'll just appear on the website immediately. The person just has to enter the same name and email as the one in the previously approved comment.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Next, let's look at the settings for comment submission that are visible under</span> <span class="packt_screen">Other comment settings</span><span>:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3475aedc-775c-4a99-aebb-04cdf4d5f973.png" style="width:53.42em;height:14.42em;" width="1473" height="398"/></p>
<p>The first two options control what the user has to do before even being able to type in a comment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Comment author must fill out the name and email</span>: If you leave this checked, then anyone posting a comment will encounter an error if they try to leave either of the fields blank. This doesn't add a huge amount of security because robots know how to fill out a name and an email and because anyone can put fake information in there. However, it does help your blog readers to keep a track of who is who if a long discussion develops, and it can slightly discourage utterly impulsive commenting. Also, visitors who have a Gravatar account are quite willing to provide their email addresses anyway. That's because using an email address that's connected to Gravatar will result in their profile picture (avatar) being displayed along with the comment, making it much more personal and visible among all the other comments.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Users must be registered and logged in to comment</span>: Most bloggers do not check this box because it means that only visitors who register for the blog can comment. Most bloggers don't want random people registering, and most visitors don't want to be compelled to register to your blog. If you check this box, there's a good chance you'll get no comments. Alternatively, if you're setting up a blog for a closed community of people, this setting might be useful.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Automatically close comments on articles older than X days</span>: Here, you can set any number of days after which the comments on your content will be closed. Although this feature might not seem like a useful one at first, it can actually be valuable to various kinds of news sites or other online publications, where allowing comments on old events makes little sense.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Show comments cookies opt-in checkbox</span>: When checked, the user will see another checkbox under the comment form, saying: <em>Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</em></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Enable threaded (nested) comments X levels deep</span>: This option is enabled by default, and it's yet another way of making your site more readable and user-friendly. Sometimes, commenters want to be able to respond to someone else's comments, simply as part of an ongoing discussion. This is the feature that allows them to do so. Also, it gives you, the author, a great way of interacting with your audience, through direct responses to every comment of theirs.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Break comments into pages [...]</span>: This feature won't be of any value to you unless you're getting more than 200 comments per post. So you can confidently leave it unchecked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, let's look at the settings that have to do with notifications. These two options are under the <span class="packt_screen">Email me whenever</span> header. These options are related to the circumstances of receiving an email notification regarding comment activity:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/af789291-84ac-4cc2-bdd7-b5a92cbb91cc.png" style="width:38.92em;height:7.17em;" width="1254" height="230"/></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Anyone posts a comment</span>: This is generally a good setting to keep. You'll get an email whenever anyone posts a comment, irrespective of whether it needs to be moderated. This will make it easier for you to follow the discussion on your blog, and to be aware of a comment that is not moderated, and that requires deletion quickly.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">A comment is held for moderation</span>: If you're not particularly interested in following every comment on your blog, you can uncheck the <span class="packt_screen">Anyone posts a comment</span> checkbox, and only leave this one checked. You will only get an email about legitimate-looking comments that appear to need moderation and/or your approval.</li>
</ul>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">When to moderate or blacklist a comment</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you scroll down the page a bit, you'll see the <span class="packt_screen">Comment Moderation</span> area:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/00a7754a-3b68-4ddd-a909-a13e2a4e982f.png" width="1521" height="293"/></p>
<p>This is an extension of the moderation settings from the top of the page. Note that if you've checked the <span class="packt_screen">Comment must be manually approved</span> checkbox, you can safely ignore this <span class="packt_screen">Comment Moderation</span> box. Otherwise, you can use this box to help WordPress figure out which comments are probably okay, and which might be spam or inappropriate for your blog. You can tell WordPress to suspect a comment if it has more than a certain number of links, as spam comments are frequently just a list of URLs.</p>
<p>The larger box is for you to enter suspect words and IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Here, you can type words that are commonly found in spam (you can figure this out by looking through your junk email), or just uncouth words in general.</li>
<li>The IP addresses would be those of any comments you got in the past from someone who commented inappropriately or added actual spam. Whenever WordPress receives a comment on your blog, it captures the IP address for you so that you'll have them handy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scroll down a bit more, and you'll see the <span class="packt_screen">Comment Blacklist</span> box:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f093d294-a821-4600-8cd2-f440bbab162b.png" width="1456" height="218"/></p>
<p>Unlike the <span class="packt_screen">Comment Moderation</span> box we just saw, which tells WordPress how to identify suspect comments, the <span class="packt_screen">Comment Blacklist</span> box tells WordPress how to identify comments that are almost definitely bad. These comments won't be added to the moderation queue, and you won't get an email about them; they'll be marked as spam right away.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The final section on this page is labeled <span class="packt_screen">Avatars</span>. Just as I mentioned in <a href="2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Getting Started with WordPress</em>, an avatar is an image that is a person's personal icon. Avatars in WordPress are provided through Gravatar, a service available at <a href="https://gravatar.com/">https://gravatar.com/</a> that lets you create your personal online profile, which is going to then to be consistently used on other websites across the web. By default, avatars will show up on your blog if you leave the <span class="packt_screen">Avatar Display</span> box checked, which is visible near the bottom of the discussion settings page.</p>
<p>The second box, <span class="packt_screen">Maximum Rating</span>, will tell WordPress when it should not show avatars that have been rated as too explicit. Remember the rating we set when uploading a new picture to Gravatar? This setting here is the place where you can choose which pictures you want to allow on your site (selecting the <span class="packt_screen">G</span> rating is advisable).</p>
<p>The third box, <span class="packt_screen">Default Avatar</span>, tells WordPress what avatar to use for visitors who do not come with their own image.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Moderating comments</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Now that we've thoroughly explored the settings for which comments need to be moderated, let's discuss what you actually need to do in order to moderate comments. <em>Moderating</em> means that you look over a comment that is in limbo and decide whether it's insightful enough that it can be published on your blog. If it's good, it gets to appear on the frontend of your website; and if it is bad, it's either marked as spam, or gets deleted and is never seen by anyone but you, and the person who wrote it.</p>
<p>To view comments waiting for moderation, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Comments</span> from the main sidebar of the WordPress dashboard. If you have any comments awaiting moderation, there will be a little number in the main menu telling you how many comments are awaiting moderation:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5119bc78-c3e2-4960-abb3-6a8047eab4ae.png" width="1689" height="514"/></p>
<p>This main <span class="packt_screen">Comments</span> page is fully featured, just like the <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> page. For each comment, you see the following information from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commenter avatar, name, website address (if there was any given), email address (if there was any given), and IP</li>
<li>Comment text, along with links to approve it so that it shows up on the site (the links appear when you hover your mouse over the comment); you can also mark it as <span class="packt_screen">Spam</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Trash</span> it, <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> it, <span class="packt_screen">Quick Edit</span> it, or <span class="packt_screen">Reply</span> to it</li>
<li>Comment submission time and date</li>
<li>The title of the post on which the comment was made (which is also a link to edit that post), a number in parentheses indicating how many approved comments are already there for that post (which is also a link that will filter the comments list so that it shows only the comments for that post), and a link to the post itself (labeled <span class="packt_screen">View Post</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments that are awaiting moderation have a reddish background, like the first comment in the preceding screenshot.</p>
<p>You can click on the <span class="packt_screen">Quick Edit</span> link under any comment to open its quick-access options. This will allow you to edit the text of the comment and the commenter's name, email, and URL.</p>
<p>You can use the links at the top—<span class="packt_screen">All</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Pending</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Approved</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Spam</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Trash</span>, to filter the list based on those statuses. You can also filter either pings or comments with the <span class="packt_screen">All comment types</span> pull-down filter menu. You can check one or more comments to apply any of the bulk actions available in the <span class="packt_screen">Bulk Actions</span> menus at the top and bottom of the list.</p>
<p>Another quick way to get to this page, or to apply an action to a comment, is to use the links in the email that WordPress sends you when a comment is held for moderation (provided you've selected that option in the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Discussion</span> panel).</p>
<p>Additionally, this listing is where all pingbacks appear for moderation. From a blog owner's point of view, pingbacks look just like any other comments, which means that you can edit them, mark them as spam, or trash them like you normally would with standard comments.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding and managing categories</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Earlier in this chapter, you learned how to add a category quickly when adding a post. Now, let's talk about how to manage your categories in a bigger way. First, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span>. You'll see the <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span> page, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/79db3d68-94dc-4140-8d7a-35d4782aea7f.png" width="1316" height="728"/></p>
<p>This is a useful page that combines the ability to add, edit, and review all of your categories. As you can see, any category that you've added when working on your blog posts is listed here. You can <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Quick Edit</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Delete</span> any category by clicking on the appropriate link in the list.</p>
<p>If you add a category on this page, you can also choose its <span class="packt_screen">Slug</span>. The slug is the short bit of text that shows up in the URL of your site. If you don't choose a slug, WordPress will create one for you by taking the category name, reducing it to all lowercase, replacing spaces with dashes, and removing any other punctuation mark (similar to what's being done with slugs for posts).</p>
<p>Another thing you can do on this page is to choose a parent category for any category. Some themes support displaying categories hierarchically, but not all do. In a good, modern theme, if you create a custom menu for categories, all child categories will be displayed as submenus.</p>
<p>The ability to create a hierarchy of categories is actually the main technical thing that separates categories from tags. Other than that, both taxonomies are quite similar in construction, although they still have different purposes.</p>
