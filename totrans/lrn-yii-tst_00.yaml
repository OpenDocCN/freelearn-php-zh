- en: Since I've stumbled upon Yii first and Codeception later on, I couldn't believe
    that someone actually thought of solving the eternal damnation of a difficult
    testing panorama that most web developers, including me, have suffered with for
    so many years.

- en: I've poured a good part of myself into this book, hoping that I could finally
    create a book that I never managed to find when I needed to learn about testing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I believe the hardest part has been concentrating all of the accumulated experience,
    reading, conferences, and chats I've had about quality assurance, testing, and
    project management.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this wouldn't have been possible without the great effort that has been
    put into Yii in its current version (version 2) and Codeception. Both these pieces
    of software, and the rest that are noted throughout the book, are the result of
    the efforts of hundreds of developers across the globe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With all of this, together with the compassion and patience of Cristina, who
    tolerated my restless evenings to exhaustion, I have the pleasure to release this
    book, hoping that you will find an inspiration to discuss, improve, and contribute
    to the testing and web development community.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book requires very little to start with. If you've got a decent development
    machine, the only other thing that you need to install and set up for yourself
    is a LAMP stack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you've worked in this field previously, you might be already aware that there
    are many other variants that allow you to use a perfectly compatible LAMP stack,
    such as Nginx, PostgreSQL, or something else. You can even run everything in a
    VPS or a virtual machine sitting on your local hard drive. This book does not
    come with instructions on how to set up everything as you need, so be prepared
    to get something up and running before opening the browser.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the required understanding of the underlying software and service layer,
    this book can be approached by anyone with some experience in web development
    and knowledge of OOPHP programming. A seasoned programmer should have no problems
    approaching this book, as it can be considered a way of increasing and reaffirming
    their knowledge in testing techniques and practices.
  prefs: []

    required because every aspect of it will be covered, from the theoretical side
    to the deeply practical side.
