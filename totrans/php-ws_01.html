			<p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to work with PHP's built-in templating engine; write simple HTML files; run a PHP script from the command line; create and assign variables to print simple messages on the web browser; and run PHP's built-in web server on your machine.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the world of <strong class="bold">Hypertext Preprocessor</strong> (<strong class="bold">PHP</strong>). PHP is a popular programming language that's used all over the internet to create web pages/websites and applications. A web page is a single page, while multiple web pages together are commonly referred to as a website or web application. PHP powers sites such as Facebook, Wikipedia, and WordPress.</p>
			<p>PHP was created as a scripting language to allow rich dynamic content (content can come from other PHP pages or can be dynamic in nature and come from external sources such as a database). PHP is an interpreted language, which means you do not have to compile it and create an executable file. Instead, PHP files are interpreted line by line by the web server running PHP. </p>
			<p>Compiled languages cannot run directly after each change. Instead, they require an interpreter to compile the code into a program that can be executed. Interpreted languages, on the other hand, can be reloaded as soon as there is a change in the code, allowing for changes to be seen quickly. </p>
			<p>PHP is used along with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create dynamic web applications. Since PHP is easy to learn, it has a huge developer community around the world. This has led to more and more developers releasing open source projects, frameworks, and resources. For instance, PHP Framework Interop Group, otherwise known as PHP-FIG, (<a href="https://packt.live/2oJ0FvY">https://packt.live/2oJ0FvY</a>) has created a series of standard recommendations that most developers use to write their code. GitHub houses many open source projects for others to use, and sites such as <a href="https://packt.live/2oaK3gt">https://packt.live/2oaK3gt</a> have many videos on web development.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Getting Started with PHP Web Development</h1>
			<p>PHP is a server-side scripting language. Server-side scripting is a way that web servers can respond to client requests via HTTP. The way this works is that a client (a browser) requests a URL. This request is then sent by a web server to a script. The script then reads this request and, depending on the code in the script, returns the contents of a page.</p>
			<p>This process happens every time a web page is visited. When working with forms, data is sent from the client to the server. The data is processed and a response is returned. A common example is that on Facebook, you enter a status update and press <em class="italic">Enter</em>. The text is sent via a <strong class="source-inline">POST</strong> request to the server, checked by the scripts on the server, and then saved to a database. The web page is then updated with the new post. PHP sites can also be API services, which may be called either from JavaScript scripts (as AJAX calls, for instance) or from other services. In those and similar cases, there is no browser request involved.</p>
			<p>The following tools are needed for web development:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.</li>
				<li>A text editor such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, or an <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) such as PHP Storm.</li>
				<li>A server to run PHP Apache or NGINX can be used, as well as PHP's built-in server.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Built-in Templating Engine</h2>
			<p>PHP was created to write applications for the web. It can be written alongside HTML to create dynamic pages. We will see examples of this in a moment.</p>
			<p>A PHP templating engine is a way to allow PHP code to output its content alongside HTML content. This gives flexibility to pages. Any page intended to use PHP code has a .php extension instead of an .html extension. This informs the web server to expect PHP content.</p>
			<p>A PHP file has a .php extension, and it can contain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, along with PHP. Since the PHP interpreter needs to know where the code is placed in a PHP file, PHP code is written between two special tags (<strong class="source-inline">&lt;?php</strong>...<strong class="source-inline">?&gt;</strong>). These tags are called opening and closing tags. A typical PHP file looks like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code-heading">Example1.01.php<a id="_idTextAnchor027"/></p>
			<p class="source-code">1  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">2  &lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">3  &lt;head&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">4      &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">5      &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">6      &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">7     &lt;title&gt;My First PHP Page&lt;/title&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">8  &lt;/head&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">9  &lt;body&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">10     &lt;div&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">11         &lt;h1&gt;The Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">12         &lt;p&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">13             &lt;?php</p>
			<p class="source-code">14             // your php code goes here </p>
			<p class="source-code">15             ?&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code-link"><a href="https://packt.live/326OLKU">https://packt.live/326OLKU</a></p>
			<p>This page starts off with HTML declaring the doctype, which tells the browser to expect HTML content, followed by meta tags that inform the browser to expect UTF-8 content and a meta tag to use the latest rendering engine and zooming levels.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">HTML is covered in detail later in the chapter.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, short open tags are also available in PHP, but they are turned off by default. This can be changed by editing a <strong class="source-inline">.phpini</strong> configuration file when using Apache (this goes beyond the scope of this introduction). Short codes look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;?</p>
			<p class="source-code">// php code here</p>
			<p class="source-code">?&gt;</p>
			<p>In short, opening and closing tags inform the PHP interpreter when to start and stop interpreting the PHP code line by line.</p>
			<p>Since PHP is a useful web development tool, you will often be working in the browser. However, you will also need to be familiar with the interactive shell.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>PHP in the Interactive Shell</h2>
			<p>Interactive shells are known by a few different names. On Windows, they are referred to as Command Prompt. On Linux/Mac, Terminal is the name given to the computer application that allows commands to be issued and understood by the shell and picked up by PHP.</p>
			<p>The interactive shell allows a PHP script to run without a browser. This is how scripts are commonly executed on a server.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Exercise 1.1: Printing Hello World to the Standard Output</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will print a simple statement using the interactive shell. The interactive shell can be used to execute PHP code and/or scripts. Before we begin, ensure that you have followed the installation steps in the preface. Follow these steps to complete the exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open a Terminal/Command Prompt on your machine.</li>
				<li>Write the following command to start PHP's interactive shell and hit <em class="italic">Enter</em>:<p class="source-code">php -a</p><p>You will obtain the following output:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer023"><img alt="Figure 1.1: Getting started with the interactive shell&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_01.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1: Getting started with the interactive shell</p><p><strong class="source-inline">Interactive shell</strong> will appear on the prompt, and it changes to <strong class="source-inline">php &gt;</strong>. Now, you've entered in PHP's interactive shell and can run PHP code and execute scripts. We will explore more interactive shells in upcoming exercises.</p></li>
				<li>Write the following command: <p class="source-code">echo "Hello World!";</p><p>We will shortly explain what <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> means. Once you hit <em class="italic">Enter</em>, you will see <strong class="source-inline">Hello World!</strong> printed on the shell, as shown in the following screenshot:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer024">
					<img alt="Figure 1.2: Printing output to the console&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_02.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2: Printing output to the console</p>
			<p>Congratulations! You have executed your first PHP code.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> is a PHP construct that prints anything passed to it. In the exercise, we passed <strong class="source-inline">Hello World!</strong>. Since <strong class="source-inline">Hello World!</strong> is a string, we have double quotes wrapped around it. You can use <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> to print strings, variables, and other things.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> construct is one way to print to the screen. Another way is to use <strong class="source-inline">print('Hello world!')</strong>. While this will display the string passed to it, the main difference between <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">print</strong> is that <strong class="source-inline">print</strong> only accepts a single argument.</p>
			<p>There are also functions that look inside a variable, such as <strong class="source-inline">print_r($item)</strong>. This will output the value of any variable passed to the function. This should not be used to display a message to the screen, but instead it should be used when you need to know the contents of a variable.</p>
			<p>One important thing to note here is the semicolon at the end of the line. In PHP, the semicolon is mandatory at the end of each statement. PHP will throw an error if a statement does not end with a semicolon.</p>
			<p>By now, you should have got the idea that we can execute basic statements in the interactive shell. We will try some more of these later in this chapter. All the functions that we can execute in PHP scripts can be executed from the interactive shell.</p>
			<p>Now, we will run a PHP file to output <strong class="source-inline">Hello World</strong> rather than coding directly using the shell. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Exercise 1.2: Printing Hello World by Executing a PHP File </h2>
			<p>By now, you have learned how to use the <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> statement. Let's now go ahead and create your first PHP script. We will print the same statement as before, but we will use a PHP file this time. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a folder named <strong class="source-inline">book</strong> on your machine. Create another folder inside it named <strong class="source-inline">chapter1</strong>. It is recommended that you follow this approach for further chapters as well.</li>
				<li>Create a file named <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> inside the <strong class="source-inline">chapter1</strong> folder.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> file using a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.</li>
				<li>Write the following code in <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> and save it:<p class="source-code">&lt;?php</p><p class="source-code">echo "Hello World!";</p><p class="source-code">?&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Now, open the Terminal and move to the <strong class="source-inline">chapter1</strong> folder. Use <strong class="source-inline">cd</strong> followed by the folder name to move into the folder. To go up a folder, use <strong class="source-inline">../</strong>. </li>
				<li>Run the following command in Command Prompt:<p class="source-code">php hello.php</p><p>You will see <strong class="source-inline">Hello World!</strong> printed on the screen, just like in the following screenshot:</p></li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3: Printing output to the Terminal</p>
			<p>First, we have PHP's opening tag. The PHP interpreter will start processing lines one by one after it. The only line of code we have here is the <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> statement to which we are passing the <strong class="source-inline">Hello World!</strong> string. The PHP interpreter processes it and then this string is printed on the Terminal.</p>
			<p>All PHP files will be written like this. Some will have HTML and other code, while some may not. Also, remember that there can be multiple opening and closing tags in a single file. These can be placed anywhere in the file.</p>
			<p>So, you've learned how to use the interactive shell and how to print simple strings using the <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> statement. We will now learn about creating and using variables in PHP.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Assigning and Using Variables</h2>
			<p>Just as with any other programming language, variables in PHP are used to store data. A key point of difference is that all variable names in PHP must start with the dollar sign, <strong class="source-inline">$</strong>.</p>
			<p>Variables must start with a letter. They cannot start with a number or symbol, but they can contain numbers and symbols.</p>
			<p> Data stored in variables can be of the following types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Integer – whole numbers</li>
				<li>Boolean – true or false</li>
				<li>Float – floating-point number</li>
				<li>String – letters and numbers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The data that is stored in a variable is called the value of the variable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Creating and Assigning Variables to Print Simple Messages on the Web Browser </h2>
			<p>Consider the following example, in which we are assigning a value to a variable:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;?php</p>
			<p class="source-code">$movieName = "Avengers: Endgame";</p>
			<p class="source-code">?&gt;</p>
			<p>Here, a variable named <strong class="source-inline">$movieName</strong> has been created, and its value is the string "<strong class="source-inline">Avengers: Endgame</strong>". Since the value is a string, double or single quotes are required around it. <strong class="source-inline">=</strong> is called the assignment operator. The code basically translates to the following: <em class="italic">Assign the value on the right-hand side of the assignment operator to the variable on the left-hand side</em>.</p>
			<p>Here are some more examples of creating variables:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;?php</p>
			<p class="source-code">$language = "PHP";</p>
			<p class="source-code">$version = 7.3;</p>
			<p class="source-code">echo $language;</p>
			<p class="source-code">echo $version;</p>
			<p class="source-code">?&gt;</p>
			<p>If you run the preceding script, you will see <strong class="source-inline">PHP7.3</strong> printed. Earlier, we were directly printing values using the echo statement, but now we have assigned the values to a variable. The value is now stored in the variable. One other thing to note is that since 7.3 is a number, it does not need quotation marks.</p>
			<p>Suppose you have "PHP" written 50 times on a page. If you had to change it to "JavaScript," you would have to replace it in all 50 places. But if the same text, "PHP", is assigned to a variable, you only need to change it once and the change will be reflected everywhere. </p>
			<p>There are some rules that must be followed while creating variables:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All variable names in PHP <strong class="bold">must</strong> start with the dollar sign (<strong class="source-inline">$</strong>).</li>
				<li>A variable name cannot start with a number. It must be either a letter or an underscore. For example, <strong class="source-inline">$1name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">$@name</strong> are not valid variable names.</li>
				<li>Only A-z, 0-9, and _ are allowed in variable names.</li>
				<li>Variable names are case sensitive; for example, <strong class="source-inline">$name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">$NAME</strong> are different.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Variable names must be chosen thoughtfully. They should make sense to someone else reading the code. For example, in an application, if you have to create a variable that stores a user's bank balance, a variable name such as <strong class="source-inline">$customerBalance</strong> is far more obvious than <strong class="source-inline">$xyz</strong>.</p>
			<p>Unlike languages such as Java and .NET, PHP does not need to declare variables before using them. This means you can just create a variable whenever it's needed, although it's considered a best practice where possible to define your variables at the top of your scripts to make it clear their intent.</p>
			<p>PHP also has what are called predefined variables. These are provided by PHP and are available to use by anyone. </p>
			<p>One such variable is <strong class="source-inline">$argv</strong>. This is a list of arguments passed through the Terminal by a script. Rather than executing the script on its own, you can pass values to a script that will be available to use in the <strong class="source-inline">$argv</strong> variable. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Exercise 1.3: Using Input Variables to Print Simple Strings</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will alter the script from the previous exercise and use the input variables to print strings. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Reopen the <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> file using your favorite code editor.</li>
				<li>Replace the code with the following code and save the file:<p class="source-code">&lt;?php</p><p class="source-code">$name = $argv[1];</p><p class="source-code">echo "Hello ". $name</p><p class="source-code">?&gt;</p><p>Don't worry about the syntax at the moment. </p></li>
				<li>Now, go to the Terminal inside the <strong class="source-inline">chapter1</strong> folder.</li>
				<li>Run the following command:<p class="source-code">php hello.php packt</p><p>You will see the following output on the Terminal:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer026">
					<img alt="Figure 1.4: Printing output to the console&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_04.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4: Printing output to the console</p>
			<p>What just happened? The <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> script printed the value you passed to it. Let's examine how it worked.</p>
			<p>You passed the value <strong class="source-inline">packt</strong> through the command line. This is called passing arguments. You can send multiple arguments shared by a space and these will all be available to the PHP script. But how?</p>
			<p>Here comes <strong class="source-inline">$argv</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">$argv</strong> is a predefined variable, and once you execute a script, it gets filled with the values passed by the use. It is a list of values after the <strong class="source-inline">php</strong> keyword on the Terminal. If no arguments are passed, the list only contains the filename. In our case, the list will have two values: <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">packt</strong>.</p>
			<p>Coming back to the script, in the first line of code, we are assigning a value to the <strong class="source-inline">$name</strong> variable. What is this value? <strong class="source-inline">$argv</strong> is an array (more about that in later chapters, but basically, an array is a list of things) containing two values. With arrays, the counting begins from 0 instead of 1. So, the first value in <strong class="source-inline">$argv</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong>, which can be taken out using <strong class="source-inline">$argv[0]</strong>. We need the second value (must be character variables), hence we used <strong class="source-inline">$argv[1]</strong>. Now, the <strong class="source-inline">packt</strong> argument passed to the file is stored in the <strong class="source-inline">$name</strong> variable.</p>
			<p>In the second line, we are concatenating the text <strong class="source-inline">Hello</strong> and the <strong class="source-inline">$name</strong> variable. The dot operator (<strong class="source-inline">.</strong>) is used to concatenate multiple values. After concatenation, the string becomes <strong class="source-inline">Hello packt</strong>, which is then printed by the <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> statement.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can read about more predefined variables and their usage at <a href="https://packt.live/2nYJCWN">https://packt.live/2nYJCWN</a>.</p>
			<p>You can use either single or double quotes for strings. However, there is a difference between them. You can use variables inside double-quoted strings, and they will be parsed. By this I mean that the value of the variable will be executed rather than simply displaying the name of the variable. On the other hand, single quotes do not do any additional parsing and display the content between the quotes as it is. For this reason, single quotes are slightly faster, and it is recommended to use them.</p>
			<p>In the last exercise, we saw how to use the predefined <strong class="source-inline">$argv</strong> variable. We will use one more predefined variable in this exercise called <strong class="source-inline">$_GET</strong>. This allows information to be passed to the address bar, and PHP can read it. They are known as query strings</p>
			<p>Query strings are key-value pairs that are separated by an <strong class="bold">ampersand</strong> (<strong class="bold">&amp;</strong>). So, <strong class="source-inline">?a=1&amp;b=2</strong> is also a valid query string. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Exercise 1.4: Using the Built-in Server to Print a String</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will use the built-in server to print <strong class="source-inline">Hello Packt</strong> using the <strong class="source-inline">companyName=Packt</strong> query string. This will allow you to start using the browser to view the output of your code, rather than just using the interactive shell. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Reopen the <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> file using your favorite code editor.</li>
				<li>Replace the code with the following code and save the file:<p class="source-code">&lt;?php</p><p class="source-code">$name = $_GET['companyName'];</p><p class="source-code">echo "Hello ". $name;</p><p class="source-code">?&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Go to the Terminal and go inside the <strong class="source-inline">chapter1</strong> folder.</li>
				<li>Run the following command to run PHP's built-in web server:<p class="source-code">php -S localhost:8085</p></li>
				<li>Now, open the browser and enter the following in the address bar and hit <em class="italic">Enter</em>:<p class="source-code">http://localhost:8085/hello.php?companyName=Packt</p><p>You will see the following output on your screen:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer027">
					<img alt="Figure 1.5: Printing output to the browser&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_05.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.5: Printing output to the browser</p>
			<p>This is somewhat like the previous exercise, but rather than using the Terminal, we used the browser.</p>
			<p>Notice the URL in the browser. After the filename, we have appended <strong class="source-inline">?companyName=Packt</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">?</strong> denotes that what follows is a query string. In our code, a variable named <strong class="source-inline">companyName</strong> with a value of <strong class="source-inline">Packt</strong> is being passed to the PHP file.</p>
			<p>Coming to the code now, in the first line, we have <strong class="source-inline">$_GET['companyName']</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">$_GET</strong> is also a predefined variable that is populated when any PHP string with a query string is executed. So, by using <strong class="source-inline">$_GET['companyName']</strong>, we will get the value <strong class="source-inline">Packt</strong>, which will be stored in the <strong class="source-inline">$name</strong> variable. Remember that you can extract any value from the query string using the respective key.</p>
			<p>The next line then combines them and displays the result on the browser.</p>
			<p>Now that we have started to use the browser to view the output of our work, let's take a quick look at HTML. As discussed earlier, PHP and HTML are often used hand-in-hand, so an understanding of HTML will prove useful as you become more familiar with PHP.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>HyperText Markup Language</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">HyperText Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTML</strong>) is a language whose meaning is defined via tags and attributes in a hierarchical way. It is used for creating documents such as web pages on the World Wide Web, which are usually displayed in a web browser. They can include texts, links, pictures, and even sound and video.</p>
			<p>HTML uses different tags and attributes to define the layout of a web document such as forms.</p>
			<p>A tag is an HTML element enclosed by <strong class="source-inline">&lt;</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">&gt;</strong>, such as <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;p&gt;</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">&lt;br&gt;</strong>. It consists of an opening tag and an ending tag, with content in-between. For example, consider the following line of HTML:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;p&gt;A paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</p>
			<p>The opening tag is <strong class="source-inline">&lt;p&gt;</strong> and the closing tag is <strong class="source-inline">&lt;/p&gt;</strong>, while the content is <strong class="source-inline">A paragraph</strong>.</p>
			<p>An attribute of the HTML element provides additional information about the element and is described by its name and value and has the following syntax: <strong class="source-inline">name[="value"]</strong>. Specifying the value is optional. For example, the following hyperlink has an attribute with the name <strong class="source-inline">href</strong>, and the value <strong class="source-inline">/home</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;a href="/home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</p>
			<p>Any HTML document requires the document type declaration, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong>, and the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;title&gt;</strong> tag, like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;title&gt;The document title&lt;/title&gt;</p>
			<p>There is a list of optional tags that many developers use to create the structure of an HTML document, which are <strong class="source-inline">&lt;html&gt;</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">&lt;html&gt;</strong> tag is the root tag of the HTML document, which is placed immediately after the document type declaration. It will contain the other two optional tags: <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> tag is used for the <em class="italic">page metadata</em> and includes <strong class="source-inline">&lt;meta&gt;</strong> tags to describe the encoding character set used in document for example, it includes the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;title&gt;</strong> tag, and external resources, such as styles, fonts, and scripts. The <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> block is used to render its contents in a browser window and includes the largest variety of HTML tags.</p>
			<p>The aforementioned HTML tags can be seen in any HTML document.</p>
			<p>Here's a list of the most frequently used tags:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;div&gt;</strong>: This tag defines a section in an HTML document. It is usually used as a wrapper element for other HTML elements.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;h1&gt;</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">&lt;h6&gt;</strong>: The heading tags are used to define the heading of the HTML document. <strong class="source-inline">&lt;h1&gt;</strong> defines the most important headings (they also use the biggest font size), while <strong class="source-inline">&lt;h6&gt;</strong> defines the least important headings. They can be used anywhere in an HTML document.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;p&gt;</strong>: The paragraph tag is used to define paragraph content in an HTML document.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;em&gt;</strong>: The emphasis tag is used to emphasize text.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;b&gt;</strong> and/or <strong class="source-inline">&lt;strong&gt;</strong>: The bold tag is used to specify bold content.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;a href="..."&gt; Link name &lt;/a&gt;</strong>: The anchor tag is used to link one page to another page.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;ul&gt;</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">&lt;li&gt;</strong>: The unordered list and list item tags are used to list the content without order (like a bulleted list).</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;ol&gt;</strong>: This tag is used to represent a numbered list</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;br&gt;</strong>: The line break tag is used to break the line.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;img&gt;</strong>: The image tag is used to add an image element to an HTML document.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;hr&gt;</strong>: The horizontal rule tag is used to display the horizontal line in an HTML document.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;table&gt;</strong>: The table tag is used to create a table in an HTML document.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;tr&gt;</strong>: The table row tag is used to define a row in an HTML table.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;th&gt;</strong>: The table heading cell tag defines the header cell in a table.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;td&gt;</strong>: The table data cell tag defines the standard cell in a table.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;form&gt;</strong>: The form tag is used to create an HTML form.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;input&gt;</strong>: The input tag is used to collect and submit user data (such as forms from a browser).</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;select&gt;</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">&lt;option&gt;</strong>: The select input tag is used to select an option value from a drop-down list.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;label&gt;</strong>: The label tag prints the label for a form input.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Consider the following HTML block:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;head&gt; </p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;title&gt;HTML Document Title&lt;/title&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;/head&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;body&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;Heading Text&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;p&gt;A paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;form method="post"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;input type="text" name="domain"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;input type="submit" value="Send"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;/form&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;/body&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;/html&gt;</p>
			<p>Let's have a look at the HTML elements in this block:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong> declares the document type to HTML5.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</strong> is the opening tag for the root element of the HTML document. The <strong class="source-inline">lang</strong> attribute is pointing to the document content language.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> opens the metadata block.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</strong> declares the character set used in the HTML document.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;title&gt;HTML Document Title&lt;/title&gt;</strong> sets the title to <strong class="source-inline">HTML Document Title</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> opens the HTML document content block.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;h1&gt;Heading Text&lt;/h1&gt;</strong> adds a <strong class="source-inline">Heading Text</strong> heading.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;p&gt;A paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</strong> adds a paragraph containing the text <strong class="source-inline">A paragraph</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;form method="post"&gt;</strong> opens the form block, declaring the method that will be used to send its data (more about this in <em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Using HTTP</em>).</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;input type="text" name="domain"&gt;</strong> adds a text input field called <strong class="source-inline">domain</strong>. The "domain" value is the name of the input type.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;input type="submit" value="Send"&gt;</strong> adds a submit button with <strong class="source-inline">Send</strong> on it.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;/form&gt;</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;/head&gt;</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;/body&gt;</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">&lt;/html&gt;</strong> are the closing tags for the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;form&gt;</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">&lt;html&gt;</strong> tags.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The preceding code will render the following web page:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer028">
					<img alt="Figure 1.6: Layout of the web page&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_06.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.6: Layout of the web page</p>
			<p>We can access the file with a <strong class="source-inline">GET</strong> request. Submitting the form will result in a <strong class="source-inline">POST</strong> request:</p>

				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer029">

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSS</strong>) is the language for defining the styles of web pages. It is possible to change color, font, and so on using CSS. While the HTML describes the structure of a web page, CSS describes what the page will look like on various devices and screen types.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, it is very common to use a CSS framework because it contains some presets to make the web pages compatible across browsers, and offers a number of tools, such as a grid system, to make the creation of page layout easier and to implement responsiveness.</p>
			<p>One such framework is Bootstrap, and using it is as simple as including the generated and minified CSS file in the HTML document:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p>
			<p>Including the CSS file in the original HTML document will make the browser render the page a bit differently:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer030">
					<img alt="Figure 1.8: Rendering the web page&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_08.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.8: Rendering the web page</p>
			<p>As you can see, the font is different, but no other major changes are visible. This is because the CSS rules from the linked file do not match any of the elements to decorate. The Bootstrap documentation (<a href="https://packt.live/2N1LHJU">https://packt.live/2N1LHJU</a>) shows what it is capable of. Usually, the class attributes are used to match the target HTML elements. Therefore, by simply adding <strong class="source-inline">class="btn btn-primary"</strong> to the submit input, we will get the button formatted according to the defined style:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer031">
					<img alt="Figure 1.9: Adding CSS to a button&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_09.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.9: Adding CSS to a button</p>
			<p>We didn't need to define a single CSS rule. The button was rendered according to the already-defined rules from the Bootstrap framework. If we inspect the submitted input styles in Developer Tools (Chrome), we will see the following cascade that is applied to the HTML element:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer032">
					<img alt="Figure 1.10: Inspecting the submit input styles in Developer Tools&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.10: Inspecting the submit input styles in Developer Tools</p>
			<p>Of course, we can create an additional CSS file and link it to the HTML document, overwriting some of the Bootstrap declarations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Exercise 1.5: Creating a Login Form Page Using Bootstrap</h2>
			<p>You are required to create a simple login page using the Bootstrap framework. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a file called <strong class="source-inline">login-form.html</strong>.</li>
				<li>Declare the document type as HTML5 and open the root HTML element:<p class="source-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Add the head block containing the page title, the link to the Bootstrap CSS framework, and the meta tag required by the CSS framework:<p class="source-code">&lt;head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;title&gt;Login form&lt;/title&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/      bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"       name="viewport"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/head&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="source-inline">body</strong> element and add the container <strong class="source-inline">div</strong>, aligning the contents to the <strong class="source-inline">center</strong>:<p class="source-code">&lt;body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;div class="container d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Open the form element and add the form title – an H1 centered text heading:<p class="source-code">    &lt;form method="post"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">        &lt;div class="text-center mt-4"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">            &lt;h1 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal"&gt;Authenticate&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p class="source-code">        &lt;/div&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Add the first form label and input group for the username:<p class="source-code">        &lt;div class="form-label-group mb-3"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">            &lt;label for="inputUser"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;</p><p class="source-code">            &lt;input class="form-control" id="inputUser" name="username"               placeholder="Username" type="text"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">        &lt;/div&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Add the password-related label and input tags:<p class="source-code">        &lt;div class="form-label-group mb-3"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">            &lt;label for="inputPassword"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;</p><p class="source-code">            &lt;input class="form-control" id="inputPassword" name="password"                placeholder="Password" type="password"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">        &lt;/div&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Add the button that will submit the form:<p class="source-code">        &lt;button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block"           type="submit"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Close all opened tags.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">The final file can be referred at <a href="https://packt.live/2MBLNZx">https://packt.live/2MBLNZx</a>.</p><p>Open the file in the browser. The expected output is as follows:</p></li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.11: The login page</p>
			<p>The form is rendered using the default styles of Bootstrap, which are far richer than the browser's defaults.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you rendered an HTML page, including some of the most widely used HTML elements, such as the form element, and you used the Bootstrap CSS file:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;Hello &lt;?php echo $name; ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p>In this case, the <strong class="source-inline">Packt</strong> string is stored in the $name variable, and the output <strong class="source-inline">Hello Packt</strong> will be printed in heading 1 (in the biggest font size).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The file extension will be <strong class="source-inline">.php</strong>.</p>
			<p>This is possible because PHP scans the script file and will only run the code between the opening tag <strong class="source-inline">(&lt;?php</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">&lt;?=</strong>) and the closing tag (<strong class="source-inline">?&gt;</strong>) when the closing tag is present, replacing it with the code output, if any.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Exercise 1.6: Printing PHP Code Output between HTML Tags</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will use the built-in server to print <strong class="source-inline">Hello Packt</strong> using the <strong class="source-inline">companyName=Packt</strong> query string. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Reopen the <strong class="source-inline">hello.php</strong> file using your favorite code editor.</li>
				<li>Replace the code with the following code and save the file:<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo "Hello ". $_GET['companyName'];?&gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;hr&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Now, open the browser and enter the following in the address bar and hit <em class="italic">Enter</em>:<p class="source-code">http://localhost:8085/hello.php?companyName=Packt</p><p>You will see the following output on your screen:</p></li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.12: Printing output to the browser</p>
			<p>As we can see, PHP has such a degree of flexibility that it allows us to use parts of PHP code <em class="italic">inside</em> other types of content.</p>
			<p>Let's now have a look at other predefined variables available in PHP.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Using the Server Variable</h1>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">$_SERVER</strong> is an already populated predefined array made available by PHP. It contains information about the server and the environment. The information available in <strong class="source-inline">$_SERVER</strong> differs from server to server, so the fields may vary depending on the environment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Exercise 1.7: Displaying Server Information</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will use <strong class="source-inline">$_SERVER</strong> to print the server information to the browser. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="source-inline">chapter1</strong> folder.</li>
				<li>Create a new file named <strong class="source-inline">server.php</strong> in the folder.</li>
				<li>Write the following PHP code in the file and save it:<p class="source-code">&lt;?php </p><p class="source-code">echo '&lt;pre&gt;';</p><p class="source-code">print_r($_SERVER);</p><p class="source-code">echo '&lt;/pre&gt;';</p><p class="source-code">?&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Open your browser and type the following URL in the address bar:<p class="source-code">http://localhost:8085/server.php</p><p>You will see a screen like the following:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer035">
					<img alt="Figure 1.13: Printing details to the browser&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14196_01_13.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.13: Printing details to the browser</p>
			<p>In the preceding code, we used the <strong class="source-inline">print_r</strong> statement to print the contents of <strong class="source-inline">$_SERVER</strong>. Since it is an array containing multiple entries, we used PHP's <strong class="source-inline">print_r</strong> function instead of <strong class="source-inline">echo</strong> to display its contents. The <strong class="source-inline">pre</strong> tags above and below it separates each item out on to a new line, making it easier to read.</p>
			<p>In the browser, we can see that it has printed a lot of information. We have port information, file locations, and many other fields. As mentioned earlier, the information on your system may vary.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Other Predefined Variables</h2>
			<p>Here are some often-used predefined variables and their usage:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$_POST</strong>: We used <strong class="source-inline">$_GET</strong> earlier in this chapter. <strong class="source-inline">$_POST</strong> is similar, but with one difference. <strong class="source-inline">$_GET</strong> fetches you the values from a query string, whereas <strong class="source-inline">$_POST</strong> contains the data from a form on any PHP page. You will use it more in later chapters.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$_FILES</strong>: If a file is uploaded from a form on a page, its information is available in the <strong class="source-inline">$_FILES</strong> array.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$_COOKIE</strong>: This allows basic text information to be stored as a cookie on the client's browser to be saved for later. A common example of this is if you log in to a website and tick <strong class="source-inline">Remember me</strong>, a cookie will be saved on the browser, which will be read on the next visit.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$_REQUEST</strong>: This contains the combined information of <strong class="source-inline">$_GET</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">$_POST</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">$_COOKIE</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$_SESSION</strong>: These are session variables that are used to maintain state in the application. They allow values to be saved in memory for the duration of a session. This could be a username that is saved and displayed on the page while the session exists.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$GLOBALS</strong>: This contains all variables that are available to a script. It includes variables, data from <strong class="source-inline">$_GET</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">$_POST</strong>, any file upload data, session info, and cookie information.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Assignment by Value and by Reference</h2>
			<p>It is very important to be aware of different ways in which values can be assigned to a variable. In PHP, there are two ways to do it: assignment by value and assignment by reference. Let's look at each of these one by one.</p>
			<p>Assignment by reference means assigning a reference of a variable using an ampersand with a variable like this: <strong class="source-inline">$var = &amp;$othervar;</strong>. Assignment by reference means that both variables end up pointing at the same data, and nothing is copied anywhere.</p>
			<p>Assignment by value means a value will be assigned to a new variable but has no reference back to any other variables. It's a standalone variable with a value.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Exercise 1.8: Assigning a Variable by Reference and Changing its Value</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will assign a variable by reference. Then, we will change the other variable's value and ensure that the original variable's value has also changed. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Move inside the <strong class="source-inline">chapter1</strong> folder on your system.</li>
				<li>Create a new file named <strong class="source-inline">assignment.php</strong> in this folder.</li>
				<li>First, we will declare a <strong class="source-inline">$animal1</strong> variable and assign the value <strong class="source-inline">Cat</strong> to it. Then, we declare another variable, <strong class="source-inline">$animal2</strong>, and assign the <strong class="source-inline">$animal1</strong> variable to it. This means that the value of <strong class="source-inline">$animal1</strong> is copied to the <strong class="source-inline">$animal2</strong> variable. We then confirm this by echoing both variables in line 10, where we see that both variables have the value <strong class="source-inline">Cat</strong>:<p class="source-code">&lt;?php </p><p class="source-code">// Assignment by value</p><p class="source-code">echo 'Assignment by value';</p><p class="source-code">echo '&lt;br&gt;';</p><p class="source-code">$animal1 = 'Cat';</p><p class="source-code">$animal2 = $animal1;</p><p class="source-code">echo $animal1 . ' - ' . $animal2;</p><p class="source-code">echo '&lt;br&gt;';</p></li>
				<li>Next, when we write <strong class="source-inline">$animal2 = 'Dog'</strong>, we change the value of the <strong class="source-inline">$animal2</strong> variable to <strong class="source-inline">Dog</strong> and then again print both the variables. Now, we can see that although the value of <strong class="source-inline">$animal2</strong> has changed, it did not have any effect on <strong class="source-inline">$animal1</strong>. This is what we call assignment by value. The value is just copied from one variable to the other, and both variables remain independent:<p class="source-code">$animal2 = 'Dog';</p><p class="source-code">echo $animal1 . ' - ' . $animal2;</p><p class="source-code">echo '&lt;br&gt;';</p><p>Now, let's look at assignment by reference. "By reference" means that the new variable becomes an alias of the older variable. Hence, changing the value of the new variable changes the value of the older variable.</p></li>
				<li>Now, we will declare another variable, <strong class="source-inline">$animal3</strong>, with the value set to <strong class="source-inline">Elephant</strong>. Next, we create a new variable, <strong class="source-inline">$animal4</strong>, and assign the value of the <strong class="source-inline">$animal3</strong> variable to it. While doing the assignment, note the ampersand (<strong class="source-inline">&amp;</strong>) before the variable name. This ampersand tells PHP to assign the <strong class="source-inline">$animal4</strong> variable to the <strong class="source-inline">$animal3</strong> variable by reference. In the code, we will verify the value of both the variables by printing values of both variables, and they are the same:<p class="source-code">// Assignment by reference</p><p class="source-code">echo 'Assignment by reference';</p><p class="source-code">echo '&lt;br&gt;';</p><p class="source-code">$animal3 = 'Elephant';</p><p class="source-code">$animal4 = &amp;$animal3;</p><p class="source-code">echo $animal3 . ' - ' . $animal4;</p><p class="source-code">echo '&lt;br&gt;';</p><p class="source-code">$animal4 = 'Giraffe';</p></li>
				<li>To see assignment by reference in action, we change the value of <strong class="source-inline">$animal4</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Giraffe</strong>. After this, we print both variables again and can see clearly that changing the value of <strong class="source-inline">$animal4</strong> has changed the value of <strong class="source-inline">$animal3</strong> as well:<p class="source-code">echo $animal3 . ' - ' . $animal4;</p><p class="source-code">?&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Now, open the browser and point to our file by opening this URL:<p class="source-code">http://localhost:8085/assignment.php</p><p>You should see a screen like this:</p></li>
			</ol>

			<p>Unless specified, variables are always assigned by value in PHP.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Using isset to Check for Variable Declaration</h2>
			<p>At times, we need to check whether a variable has been set, especially in cases where there is some user input from a form, and we need to verify it before saving it to the database. <strong class="source-inline">isset</strong> is a built-in PHP function that returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> for declared variables with values other than <strong class="source-inline">null</strong>.</p>
			<p>Null data types are used when a variable has no value.</p>

			<p><strong class="source-inline">var_dump</strong> is a built-in PHP function that is used to print a variable's value and type. It's useful to see the contents of a variable and also what data type it contains. You can then make decisions about how to work with the variable based on this information.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">isset</strong> is a built-in PHP function that determines whether a variable is declared and is different to <strong class="source-inline">NULL</strong>. </p>
			<p>In the preceding code, we have declared two variables, <strong class="source-inline">$name1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">$name2</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">$name1</strong> is an empty string and <strong class="source-inline">$name2</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">null</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">$name3</strong> is not declared. Then, we use PHP's <strong class="source-inline">var_dump</strong> function to print <strong class="source-inline">$name1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">$name2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">$name3</strong>. Since PHP does not require declaring variables, we can use <strong class="source-inline">$name3</strong>.</p>
			<p>On printing the values, we can see that the <strong class="source-inline">isset</strong> function returned true for <strong class="source-inline">$name1</strong>, which means a valid value is set for <strong class="source-inline">$name1</strong>. This is because <strong class="source-inline">$name1</strong> has a valid value – an empty string. But it is returning <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> for <strong class="source-inline">$name2</strong> because it is set to <strong class="source-inline">null</strong>, meaning that <strong class="source-inline">$name2</strong> is not set.</p>
			<p>Lastly, we dumped info about an undeclared variable, <strong class="source-inline">$name3</strong>. Since this is not declared at all, the <strong class="source-inline">isset</strong> function returned <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, meaning this variable is also not set.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">isset</strong> is a handy function, and you will be using it a lot when working with data. </p>
			<p>A related function to <strong class="source-inline">isset</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">unset</strong>, which clears the value of a variable. </p>

			<p>In this activity, we will apply the knowledge gained from the earlier exercises and use variables to retrieve query strings from a URL and print the relevant information to the browser.</p>
			<p>You will create a simple application that allows users to view movie information in the browser. Once you complete the activity, you should have an output similar to the following:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.16: Expected outcome</p>
			<p>These steps will help you complete the activity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a file named <strong class="source-inline">movies.php</strong>.</li>
				<li>Capture query string data in the file to store the details of the movies, such as movie names, actor/actress names, and release year.</li>
				<li>Create a basic HTML structure and then display the captured query strings.</li>
				<li>Go to the Terminal and execute the command to start the built-in web server.</li>
				<li>After the web server is up and running, open the PHP page and append your query strings to the URL in your browser.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">The solution to this activity can be found on page 502.</p></li>

			<p>In this chapter, we learned what PHP is and where it stands in the market today. We also explored PHP's built-in templating engine and the interactive shell. The templating engine allows us to mix PHP and HTML in the same file. Then, using Terminal, we learned that we can run a PHP script using its built-in web server, which allows the output of a script to be viewed in a browser by going to the server's IP address (localhost in this case) and filename.</p>
			<p>We learned how to create and assign variables – by value and by reference. We also saw how to use PHP's predefined variables and how they are used. </p>
			<p>Finally, we learned how to run PHP's built-in web server and use query strings in our code. Appending data to the query string allowed us to pass extra data to the PHP script, where it could be displayed or modified by the script.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will take a look at different types used in PHP programming.</p>
