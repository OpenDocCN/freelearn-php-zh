    you can select a **shared image**, which is managed centrally and acts as a simple
    repository for assets used on multiple certificates; for instance, your company
    logo or the signatures of certificate signees. You can manage shared images by
    going to **Site administration** | **General** | **Certificates** | **Certificate
    images**. If you tick the **Use as a background image** box, the picture will
    be stretched across the entire certificate and shown behind all other elements.
    It is recommended that you use an image with added transparency when it is used
    as a background.
