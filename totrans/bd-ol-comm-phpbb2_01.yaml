  zh: 第一章. phpBB 简介
- en: An online bulletin board in essence is an Internet-enabled version of the bulletin
    boards found in stores and other public areas. It’s basically just a place where
    people leave messages for others to read. Well, the online bulletin board applications
    have become much more powerful and sophisticated than that, but the general principle
    is the same. phpBB is one of the most popular free software that implement the
    bulletin board idea on the Web today.

    是目前在网上实现公告板理念的最受欢迎的免费软件之一。

- en: An online community is a group of people that gather together on a website for
    some reason. This reason can be any subject of interest common to the group, like
    occupation, hobby, passion, or location. Such online communities are very popular,
    and their popularity is growing as more and more people start surfing the Web.
    Think about it—everyone has something he or she is passionate about. And everybody
    likes meeting people who share their interests. Historically, such computer-based
    communities existed even before the Internet; using, for example, the modem-to-modem
    based bulletin board systems (BBS).

  zh: 在线社区是一群人因为某种原因聚集在网站上的群体。这个原因可以是任何对群体共同感兴趣的主题，比如职业、爱好、激情或地点。这样的在线社区非常受欢迎，随着越来越多的人开始上网，它们的受欢迎程度正在增长。想想看——每个人都有他或她热衷的事情。而且每个人都喜欢遇到有共同兴趣的人。从历史上看，这样的基于计算机的社区甚至在互联网出现之前就存在了；例如，使用基于调制解调器的点对点公告板系统（BBS）。
- en: An essential part of being in a community is sharing and contributing (for example,
    commenting on a subject or pointing out topics of interest for the group). This
    way the site visitors are no longer just looking at a website that is set in stone.
    They are changing its face by contributing content. Today, the ability to post
    comments on the websites we visit has become so common that we almost expect it
    to be there.

  zh: 在社区中存在的一个基本部分是分享和贡献（例如，对某个主题发表评论或指出对群体感兴趣的话题）。这样，网站访客就不再是仅仅看着一个一成不变的网站。他们通过贡献内容在改变网站的面貌。如今，在我们访问的网站上发表评论的能力已经变得如此普遍，以至于我们几乎期望它在那里。
- en: Static, brochure-like sites are becoming outdated. Communities rule the Web.
    This is good news for both site owners and site visitors. Sites are built to be
    visited and used by people and at the same time, the people are taking part in
    building the sites they visit. Site owners can get immediate feedback on what
    their visitors like or dislike, and visitors get new and fresh content on every
    visit. It’s quite common these days that the community would not just *influence*
    a site owner’s decisions, but even *make* the decisions through polls or open
    discussions. So it’s not an exaggeration to say that more often than not, the
    success or the failure of a website is determined by the success or the failure
    in building an online community around the website. At the end of the day, a site
    is build to be used by the people and the people have the final say if this site
    is worth something or not.

    as simple as a guestbook, or more complicated like chat systems, web logs (blogs),
    or mailing lists. Or they can be forums, also known as bulletin boards. The forum

    forum on his wife’s site. At this time, he had two options: using a commercial

    the free solution named Phorum, which was written in PHP, but had a thread style
