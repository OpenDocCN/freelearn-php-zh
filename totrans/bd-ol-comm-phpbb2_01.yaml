    boards found in stores and other public areas. It’s basically just a place where
    people leave messages for others to read. Well, the online bulletin board applications
    have become much more powerful and sophisticated than that, but the general principle
    is the same. phpBB is one of the most popular free software that implement the
    bulletin board idea on the Web today.

- en: An online community is a group of people that gather together on a website for
    some reason. This reason can be any subject of interest common to the group, like
    occupation, hobby, passion, or location. Such online communities are very popular,
    and their popularity is growing as more and more people start surfing the Web.
    Think about it—everyone has something he or she is passionate about. And everybody
    likes meeting people who share their interests. Historically, such computer-based
    communities existed even before the Internet; using, for example, the modem-to-modem
    based bulletin board systems (BBS).

- en: An essential part of being in a community is sharing and contributing (for example,
    commenting on a subject or pointing out topics of interest for the group). This
    way the site visitors are no longer just looking at a website that is set in stone.
    They are changing its face by contributing content. Today, the ability to post
    comments on the websites we visit has become so common that we almost expect it
    to be there.

- en: Static, brochure-like sites are becoming outdated. Communities rule the Web.
    This is good news for both site owners and site visitors. Sites are built to be
    visited and used by people and at the same time, the people are taking part in
    building the sites they visit. Site owners can get immediate feedback on what
    their visitors like or dislike, and visitors get new and fresh content on every
    visit. It’s quite common these days that the community would not just *influence*
    a site owner’s decisions, but even *make* the decisions through polls or open
    discussions. So it’s not an exaggeration to say that more often than not, the
    success or the failure of a website is determined by the success or the failure
    in building an online community around the website. At the end of the day, a site
    is build to be used by the people and the people have the final say if this site
    is worth something or not.

    tools. You can invest your efforts into creating the tools yourself—assuming of
    course that you have expertise in web programming, server administration, and
    so on—or you can decide not to reinvent the wheel and can adopt a solution. That’s
    where phpBB comes in.

    as simple as a guestbook, or more complicated like chat systems, web logs (blogs),
    or mailing lists. Or they can be forums, also known as bulletin boards. The forum
    systems inherited and extended the bulletin board systems (BBS) from the dark
    pre-Internet ages, adding a web browser interface to them. phpBB belongs to the
    family of forum tools for building an online community.

    in which the software is written, and "BB" stands for "bulletin board"; it’s a
    bulletin board tool written in the PHP programming language.

    Home Page. PHP is no longer just a set of personal home page tools as it was in
    the beginning, but has grown to become a true programming language. Its abbreviation
    has gone one level deeper, and now recursively stands for "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor".
    But it’s really known simply as PHP.

    now the project manager of the phpBB project. Like a lot of other open-source
    projects, phpBB started as a personal project. James wanted to set up a discussion
    forum on his wife’s site. At this time, he had two options: using a commercial
    package like the pioneer UBB (Ultimate Bulletin Board, written in Perl) or using
    the free solution named Phorum, which was written in PHP, but had a thread style
    James didn’t like very much. So he decided to go on his own and create a UBB-like
    PHP-based bulletin board system.'

    he had created a bulletin board and would like some help with the testing. A few
    weeks later he opened up the source code for the project, making it free and available

    couldn’t accommodate the new development. The interface was also completely revamped.
