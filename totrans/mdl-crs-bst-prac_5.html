                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Being able to take a course at any time, any place, and at your own pace makes online course offerings very popular. While many courses are instructor-led and may involve extensive interaction with other students, there are also many courses that are self-guided and contain self-scoring and adaptive assessments that do not require interaction with an instructor or other students.</p>
<p>With Moodle, you can create standalone, self-paced, and independent study courses that can be used in many settings and for various purposes. They may be short training courses that all employees must take for safety, health, or regulatory compliance purposes. They could be review courses on certain subjects or courses that are created for a wide audience or just for fun.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you'll learn how to develop a consistent look and feel for all your self-paced independent study courses. We'll review plugins, resources, and activities that you will find useful to include. We'll then learn how to set up the courses at the individual course level and review the best ways to add resources, activities, and assessments. We'll also discuss how to make sure that your students can track their progress and how to automatically generate customized certificates upon course completion. Finally, we'll learn how to set up <strong>badges</strong>, build them, and also enable social media so your students can display them.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring global settings for self-paced independent study courses</li>
<li>Selecting ideal plugins, activities, resources, and assessments</li>
<li>Tracking progress and checking grades</li>
<li>Designing customized, automatically generated certificates</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating badges and social media</li>
<li>Creating an effective assessment strategy</li>
<li>Developing self-paced independent study</li>
</ul>

<p>Self-paced independent study means that your students are working on their own and that they will not have any direct interaction with an instructor or other students. Thus, there are a number of elements in Moodle that you will not need to include in your course website. For example, you will not need a forum and activities that require grading by an instructor.</p>
<p>At the same time, if students are working on their own, you may need to include self-help elements. You'll definitely need tools, such as a progress tracker, to help students know where they stand in the course, and you'll need to make sure that your instructional material, activities, and assessments tie together very clearly. You can build in activities such as low-stakes self-grading quizzes that keep students engaged and motivated. Keeping students motivated is critical because self-paced classes require students to motivate themselves and there is no teacher or tutor to provide external structure.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>You can learn more about how building in automated feedback can motivate students in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Five Principles of Successful Course Redesign</em></span> article on the National Center for Academic Transformation page at <a href="http://www.thencat.org/PlanRes/R2R_PrinCR.htm">http://www.thencat.org/PlanRes/R2R_PrinCR.htm</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Self-paced independent study courses can vary widely in their length, scope, complexity, and "stakes." Some can be completed in less than an hour, while others may be intended for completion over a semester. They can be offered by colleges, universities, corporations, not-for-profit organizations, retailers, and other organizations that need to provide educational courses and training. With the advent of mobile-friendly interfaces, such as Moodle's responsive skins which are designed to work on all kinds of tablets, smartphones, and laptops, self-paced independent study courses are more convenient than ever.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how the courses can look on your smartphone:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Courses displayed on a smart phone</div>
<p>They are designed for clear presentations and easy-to-access content. Be sure to keep the fact in mind that some students will be using the course with their cell phones when you select graphics and make sure they are smartphone-friendly.</p>

<p>The more consistent you can make your courses, the better. There may be a bit of a learning curve the first time a student takes a course, but if the second course has the same look, feel, and functionality, chances are, the student will feel more confident. The student's user experience is very important.</p>
<p>We can make sure that our courses are consistent by configuring the courses in the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span>, which will assure us that the settings we apply are site-wide and are, essentially, global. So, let's get started by looking at the best way to configure the global settings.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Theme selection</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If your students are accessing your course using a wide array of devices, including laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets, you may wish to select a responsive theme that "flows" across devices. A responsive theme will be displayed appropriately across multiple devices.</p>
<p>This section shows you how to get started with developing the ideal look and feel for your independent study course. Fundamental to the course design is the selection of a theme, which may seem odd; however, in this case, selecting the theme is critical for many reasons ranging from the course being displayed across multiple devices to being easy to navigate.</p>
<p>The <strong>Boost</strong> theme was released for Moodle 3.2 and is available as a core theme in Moodle 3.4. It is highly recommended because it automatically displays across multiple devices and also comprises very little formatting/styling. Let's select the Boost theme and configure the settings as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Themes</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Theme settings</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Theme settings</span> screen, click on the default selections for all the menu items. Make sure that the <span class="packt_screen">Default: Yes</span> checkbox is checked for <span class="packt_screen">Enable device detection</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information on the Boost theme, you may visit the Moodle documentation page for Boost at the following URL: <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Boost_theme">website: https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Boost_theme</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using MoodleCloud, you may wish to use the <strong>MoodleCloud</strong> theme, which is also responsive. Please note that for this course, I've been using the MoodleCloud theme, which is very similar to the <strong>Clean</strong> theme.</p>
<p>To change your theme, Go to <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Themes</span>| <span class="packt_screen">Theme selector</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Select theme</span> button next to the type you wish to change.</li>
<li>Scroll down to see the previews of the available themes and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Use theme</span> button to chose the theme.</li>
<li>The next screen will provide information about the theme. Click <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As we configure the courses and set the global settings, let's take a look at the activities in Moodle.</p>
<p>Most activities you will be using will use default settings. However, there are a few that may require customization, such as <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Book</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Badge</span>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Because the default settings may not be appropriate for your organization, you may wish to change some of the options. When you make changes in the <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> activity, the values you set will be the default values used globally. Perform the following steps to configure the <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> plugin:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Activities modules</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> screen, review the different options. You may wish to update the settings, such as the <span class="packt_screen">Time limit (seconds)</span> setting, and restrict students to a fixed number of attempts (rather than maintaining the default setting, that is, <span class="packt_screen">Unlimited</span>).</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span> button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following screenshot shows the <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> options screen:</p>

<p>Review some of the other plugins in the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu. Keep in mind that we may not use all the options. For more information, refer to the Moodle Docs (<a href="https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Main_page">http://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Main_page</a>) for Moodle 3.5.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Badges, which have been expanded in Moodle 3.4, are very useful for motivating students to complete their courses. When students complete a learning module that involves a skill and a summative assessment, they can begin working on their course assessments. You can set up the course to automatically generate badges when students achieve their goals. Then, they can display the badge in their "backpack" or on social media sites such as Facebook. Mozilla's OpenBadges project includes a Badges Backpack in which badges can be displayed.</p>
<p>Let's configure our courses for badges. Remember, we are enabling the badges site-wide. You may also configure and upload badges for individual courses by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Badges</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Badges settings</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Badges settings</span> screen, type in the name of your organization or the issuing agent. Then, include your email address. Make sure that you check <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> for <span class="packt_screen">Enable connection to external backpacks</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Enable course badges</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add a badge, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Badges</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Manage badges</span> and then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add a new badge</span> button.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Badge details</span> screen, type the name and a description of the badge. Then upload an image. This will be the badge image that will be displayed. It should be in the <kbd>.jpeg</kbd> or <kbd>.gif</kbd> formats and no larger than 200 x 200 pixels in size.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Create badge</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-402 image-border" src="assets/48e800d7-d963-432f-9e4e-8830f83ceb27.png" style="width:85.33em;height:58.83em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"/>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>You can learn more about badges in the Mozilla Open Badges project at <a href="http://openbadges.org/">http://openbadges.org/</a>. You can also sign up for a backpack in which you can display your badges at <a href="http://backpack.openbadges.org">backpack.openbadges.org</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>To create a unique design for your badge, which incorporates your own photos, you can use free web-based photo editing such as PicMonkey (<a href="http://www.picmonkey.com/">http://www.picmonkey.com/</a>), which is an easy-to-use cloud-based program that does not require registration.</p>
<p>The following is a rather whimsical example, which took about five minutes to create using PicMonkey:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403 image-border" src="assets/724b46c1-93cf-4567-9dee-ca327b214173.png" style="width:16.42em;height:13.58em;"/></p>
<p>PicMonkey offers a wide array of elements that allow you to upload and modify your own photos or create your own design using stock elements.</p>
<p>To manage a badge within an individual course, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Badges</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Manage badges</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the name of the badge you want to edit. On the <span class="packt_screen">Badges details</span> screen, you will see the following tabs: <span class="packt_screen">Overview</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Edit details</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Criteria</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Message</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Recipients</span>. Enter the criteria for issuing the badge on each of the screens.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span>.</li>

<p>Assuming that all individuals start a course on a specific date, it might not be a bad idea to create a calendar if the course takes more than a week or so to be completed. For example, you may be offering month-long courses and the students can start working on them at the beginning of every month.</p>
<p>Let's set up a calendar for a course that lasts 1 month by using the following steps. (Notice that the default is 3 weeks, but you can change it to 1 month):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Calendar</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Modify <span class="packt_screen">Days to look ahead</span> to <span>1 month. You may </span>also change the default settings for <span class="packt_screen">Events to Lookahead</span>. The default is 10 events. </li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span>, which is located at the bottom of the screen. </li>

As you do so, add at least two more topics (in addition to those that will be units in your course). You'll use one of the topics for the instructional material that you'll be using throughout the entire course. The other topic will include practice tests/exams/quizzes. <span class="packt_screen">Add topics</span> is at the bottom of the page:</li>

<p>Let's start with resources. Having understood your subject and defined the learning outcomes of each topic, it's time to gather and organize your resources. For a self-paced course, you may consider using the types of resources described in this section.</p>
<p>In general, to add resources, click on <span class="packt_screen">Add an activity or a resource</span>. Check the drop-down menu or simply drag and drop them in the course area.</p>

<p>Using the <span class="packt_screen">File</span> resource to add resources is very effective. Make sure that your file is in a format that your students will be able to download. For example, it's a good idea to upload a PDF file rather than a Microsoft Word document.</p>
<p>Presentations (slideshows) can be uploaded as PDFs in order to avoid problems with versions and compatibility when using Keynote or PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Scripts and notes for your presentations can be uploaded as PDFs or in HTML. HTML is a good choice if you have students with poor vision because screen-reader software uses HTML.</p>
<p>Audio files/podcasts can be uploaded directly or hosted with a service such as SoundCloud (or YouTube). Allowing MP3 downloads is often a good idea because students may wish to download the files and play them on their MP3 players or smartphones.</p>

<p>If file sizes are large, it is often a good idea to first create the presentations/course content and then upload them to a cloud-based hosting service. If you do so, you may need to be able to create your presentations in different formats.</p>
<p>The following sections are guidelines for a number of different types of presentations.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Recording webcasts/presentations</h1>
                </header>

<p>One popular approach to creating a narrated presentation is using screen capture software in which you record audio as you make your presentation. You can then save and upload the presentation to a number of sites, such as YouTube, Flickr, and UStream. The advantages of using screen capture software are that the quality tends to be high, and there is quite a bit of flexibility. The disadvantages are that there can be a steep learning curve and the software licenses can be expensive.</p>
<p>For high-quality audio, be sure to invest in a good headset microphone. Avoid using the built-in microphone on your computer. When you record using your headset, be sure to double check the settings to make sure that they not default to the built-in microphone.</p>
<p><strong>CamStudio</strong> (<a href="http://www.camstudio.org">http://www.camstudio.org</a>) is a free open source program that records screen motion and audio and saves them as AVI files. It then converts them to SWF (flash). There are obvious limitations with this software program (that is, the flash files will not play on all devices and platforms). </p>
<p>Screencast-o-matic is a cloud-based software application that allows you to upload your presentation and to record audio as you advance through it, saving the entire presentation as an MP4 file that you can then upload to YouTube. For this product, please visit <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/">Screencast-o-matic</a>.</p>
<p>QuickTime (built-in on Mac) contains screen recording that can record the entire screen or part of it, with or without audio or audio only.</p>
<p>The following are a few free products for screencasts <span>(some have limited functionality)</span>. We're only including the ones that include audio, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ActivePresenter</strong>: For this product, please visit <a href="http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/free-edition/">http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/free-edition/</a>. This product can save screencasts in numerous formats.</li>
<li><strong>BB FlashBack Express</strong>: For this product, please visit <a href="http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/">http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/</a>. This product can save screencasts as flash or AVI, which can be "one-click" uploads to YouTube.</li>
<li><strong>Jing</strong>: For this product, please visit <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html">http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html</a>. You can't include audio, but Jing is a very easy and convenient way to create screen captures and videos, and then upload them. Jing works for both Mac and Windows operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>ScreenPresso</strong>: For this product, please visit <a href="http://www.screenpresso.com/featuresall">http://www.screenpresso.com/featuresall</a>. This product is portable, that is, you do not have to download it. It may not include audio. It is ideal for screen captures and recording only part of your screen.</li>
<li><strong>Camtasia Studio 8</strong>: For this product, please visit <a href="http://www.techsmith.org">http://www.techsmith.org</a>. Camtasia is a very robust product with much flexibility. It is possible to produce a very high-quality screen capture and maintain high quality. You can also optimize it for different aspect ratios, which is important when thinking about users who may use smartphones and tablets. It is available for Windows and Mac. You can download a free trial.</li>

<p>There are many options to include presentations in your course that you can build yourself or embed from other sites.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>You may be in a situation where you want to create a high-quality audio file and, perhaps later, sync it with your presentation.</p>
<p>This is a good way to avoid poor-quality audio. Having high-quality audio is important if your users are hard of hearing and use assistive speech-to-text software. Even if they do not, it is a good idea to develop a script and an outline for your course to make available when you create a screencast. You will then be following the practices of UDL and also complying with ADA guidelines.</p>
<p>To download and install audio tools, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Audacity at <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a>. Audacity is available for both Mac as well as Windows.</li>
<li>Select the Audacity installer option since it will guide you through the entire process. If you do not have permissions, you may need to download the ZIP files.</li>
<li>In order to convert the AVI files to MP3 files, you'll need to download an encoder. The LAME MP3 encoder for Windows can be found at <a href="http://lame1.buanzo.com.ar/#lamewindl">http://lame1.buanzo.com.ar/#lamewindl</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>If you have any questions about downloading/installing Audacity or LAME, read the manual at <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html">http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html</a>.</li>
<li>To share the audio file, optimize it using the MP3 encoder and then upload it to Webspace, or open an account on SoundCloud at <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">http://www.soundcloud.com</a>. You can also share audio via YouTube.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you create your presentation, do not forget to create a script or notes. You can make these available as notes or as a separate file. It is particularly important to do so if your presentation is very graphics intensive and does not include much explanatory text. You can also avoid the temptation to fill the screen with too much text using the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>You may convert your PowerPoint (or other presentation software) file to a PDF file and then upload it to the server space that you have</li>
<li>You can upload your PDF file to a discussion forum in a Learning Management System (Moodle) or share it in your company's repository (for example, Google Docs)</li>
<li>You can upload your presentation to SlideShare at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">http://www.slideshare.net/</a></li>

<p>As you build your course, you'll need to configure the settings so that they automatically score assessments and allow your students to complete their courses in a self-paced independent study environment. This section describes various activities that are easy to implement because they are easy to create and simple for the learner to follow. These are self-scoring activities.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Choice</span> activity can be easily configured for self-paced self study. Configure it with <span class="packt_screen">Competencies</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/566ac7a7-b109-48e5-92c3-94c558c209cb.png" style="width:42.17em;height:13.75em;"/></div>

<p>Moodle allows you to generate certificates if you have installed the <span class="packt_screen">Certificates</span> add-on from the Moodle Plugin Library. You can configure them to include the name of the course as well as the student's name, score, and other important information. <span class="packt_screen">Certificate</span> is a third-party plugin, and if your Moodle site does not have it, you may need to install it.</p>
<p>Now, add a certificate by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Activities</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Certificate</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Adding a new Certificate</span> page, fill in the required fields.</li>
<li>Configure the certificate using the different fields and options.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Activity completion</span> menu, select <span class="packt_screen">Show activity as complete when conditions are met</span>. The conditions to meet depend on the qualifying scores for mastery.</li>

<p>Moodle provides a wide array of options for self-paced independent study students to demonstrate achievement. We've recommended using certificates and badges because the process of earning, issuing, and displaying them can be automated.</p>
<p>Motivation through setting goals and then rewarding people when they achieve the goals is at the heart of badges and certificates.</p>
<p>In the case of badges, there is an element of gamification, which encourages students to compete with each other to earn badges and be the best in terms of their respective skill sets and interests. We have discussed badges and certificates and it's useful to review them and remind ourselves that they both motivate while the course is <span class="emphasis">in progress</span> and when it is complete.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we've learned the best way to develop and configure your course for self-paced independent study, which is ideal for students who want to study at any time, in any place, and at their own pace.</p>
<p>We've learned how to configure global settings so that your courses have a consistent look and feel. Then, we moved on to the course level and determined the best types of resources and activities for your courses. Then, we discussed how to configure them so that they are automated.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at ways to motivate students, increase their engagement in the course, and encourage course completion by means of demonstrating achievement first via certificates and then by adding a light element of gamification to your course using badges.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will guide you through developing cohort-based courses with teacher-student interaction. We'll take a close look at how to configure your courses and determine which resources, activities, and assessments will be the best fit for your cohort-based courses.</p>
