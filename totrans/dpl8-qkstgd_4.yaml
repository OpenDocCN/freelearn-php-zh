    designing new content types for specific needs, how to create them, and adding
    fields to them for storing data and making it available as selection criteria.
    Now that we've discussed the classification and storage of content, let's switch
    to the content, itself.

    to the visitor it needs to contain content. How does content get into the Drupal
    site? In this chapter, you will learn how to work with content, create it and
    edit it. Throughout this chapter you will create content (for use later in this
    book), and will learn to do the following:'

    pretty much all there is to it in terms of the content's appearance. You're limited
    to choosing whether you want to use capital letters. If you want more control
    over your message, you can switch to sending an email message, which might enable
    you to select bold, italic, or underlined text.

    text color, bulleted lists, and so forth, you might use word processing software,

    rich text is *rich text editor*.

    editor with a composition area, as shown in the following screenshot, that resembles
    standalone word processors with formatting buttons. This type of editor is referred
    to as **WYSIWYG**, which is pronounced as wizzy-wig, which stands for **What You
    See Is What You Get**, meaning that the text it displays shows the selected formatting:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *Title* is a required field for all content because it is used to identify
    one piece of content as distinct from another, though it does not have to be unique,
    and so more than one piece of content can have the same title, which quickly becomes
    confusing. The entry in this field will appear in the summary admin list of content.
    It is also used as the page title when the content is read on its own page. Therefore,
    it is best to enter a title that is both meaningful to you and informative to
    the site visitor. Enter one now. Mine will be **A Moment in the Life of My Dog**.
  prefs: []

- en: Body
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be wondering why the *Body* field is not required, since the article
    would be somewhat useless without body text. It is because you might want to create
    the article as a draft and return later to actually create the body text. This
    is not possible with the title, because without one, it would be difficult to
    find the article.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next to the field name is a link that reads Edit Summary. When creating a content
    type, the creator decides whether the body text field should accommodate having
    a separate summary, and if so, that link is shown. The summary is used, for example,
    when providing a list of content for the site visitor, where a short description
    of the content—a *teaser*—is provided.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are two ways to provide the teaser text: via a separate summary or by
    trimming, that is, excerpting text from the start of the content. I prefer to
    use the summary because trimmings are based on a set number of characters that
    is the same for all of the same type of content, such as the first 40 characters,
    so I have no control over where the excerpt will end... maybe it will end in the
    middle of a word. With a summary, I can precisely control what will be shown.
    Even if it is identical to the start of my body text, I am able to ensure that
    it ends in an appropriate place.'

    notice that the bottom right corner of the text box has a widget that''s meant
    to resemble page corners that can be grabbed with the mouse and dragged to enlarge
    or reduce the size of the text box. It also has a note below it letting you know
    that if you do not enter summary text into the field, Drupal will use a trimmed
    version of the body text as a summary. Enter some summary text into the field.
