    imagine any WordPress site that could operate without at least a handful of (essential)
    plugins installed.

    to use them, where to get them, and how to be up to date with any new useful plugins
    that get released to the community. We will also talk about some of the most basic
    and popular plugins in the WordPress world, and why having them might be a good
    idea. Okay, let's get on with it!

    that allow you to include new functionality in your WordPress site—functionality
    that is *not* available or enabled by default. One of the best advantages of WordPress
    is that it's quite an optimized platform. It makes your site load fast and doesn't
    contain much redundant code. However, WordPress itself only offers the absolute
    essential range of features—the features that are useful to everyone. At the same
    time, the platform provides a straightforward way of expanding the abilities of
    your site by introducing, you guessed it, plugins. The idea is simple—if you want
    your site to be able to handle a specific new task, there's undoubtedly a plugin
    for that. Much like in the Apple world and the popular expression, *there's an
    app for that*.

- en: The best thing about plugins is that you don't need any specific programming
    knowledge to use them. Essentially, they are just like standard applications for
    iOS or Android— you can install them and enjoy the things they have to offer without
    knowing what's going on inside. This being said, not all plugins are safe to use
    in regards to data security or code quality. We will discuss this topic later
    in this chapter.

    more user-friendly, more attractive, more social media friendly, properly backed
    up, protected against spam, and, ultimately, unique. Plugins really are one of
    the best things about WordPress.

    no easy way for site owners to introduce new functionalities to their sites. Doing
    so always required hiring a professional programmer and investing in the whole
    development process. Nowadays, this is no longer the case, and virtually anyone
    can have an impressive site without losing their shirt.

    plugin-building company or anything. Developers all over the world create plugins
    and then distribute them across the internet. And, very often, they receive no
    direct compensation whatsoever. The best and the safest place to visit for WordPress
    plugins is the official directory at [https://wordpress.org/plugins/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/):'

- en: There are more than 55,000 different plugins available in the directory at the
    time of writing this book, and that number is constantly expanding, with around
    100+ new plugins being added every week. This is really impressive because many
    of those plugins are very advanced pieces of web software and not just simple,
    one-script add-ons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    (visible in the preceding screenshot), which allows you to search plugins by topic
    and by tag. You can also view a list of the most popular plugins as well as featured
    plugins. In short, the official plugin directory is where you should always go
    first when looking for a plugin. It's also a good habit to always check how popular
    the plugins you're interested in are. Downloading plugins that already have a
    proven track record of happy users will improve your chances of getting a quality
    product that you'll enjoy using. This is really important since your site security
    should never be underestimated. By getting your plugins from the official WordPress
    directory, you can at least be certain that the plugins are not malicious in any
    way. We'll talk more about website security in the next chapter.

- en: You can also carry out Google searches when looking for plugins on a per-task
    basis. I recommend searching for the problem you're trying to solve and see what
    plugins other users recommend and why. Often, multiple plugins perform similar
    functions, and you will find feedback from other WordPress users valuable in choosing
    between them. However, as you do this, be sure to keep an eye out for malicious
    or poorly coded plugins that could break your website or allow someone to hack
    into it. Be careful when installing new plugins with no reviews, comments, or
    feedback from users, in addition to those plugins that have bad feedback about
    them on the internet.

    out the change logs and support forums for each plugin you're considering for
    your site (every plugin page inside the official `plugin` directory has a tab
    labeled Support). This should give you an idea of how well or how poorly a given
    plugin is coded, supported, and so on.

    a little outdated, but you should proceed with caution. It's also a good idea

    the more people had the chance to take a look at the plugin and evaluate its quality.

    you lose your whole site overnight with no ability to restore it? This might sound

    click on it, you will realize that this plugin is a huge one. It could probably

    simple in theory, but the work involved to achieve this can become a full-time

    imagine a website existing without at least some level of social media integration.
    The benefits of such integration are clearly visible. With a good social media
    plugin for WordPress, you will be able to share your posts with friends and family
    on all of the most popular social platforms out there. More than that, your readers
    will be able to do it too, effectively growing your audience and making your site
    more popular. Ultimately, publishing content that goes viral on social media can
    skyrocket your traffic and make your site visible to thousands of new people every
    week, or even every day.

    online publisher. Basically, a spam comment is a comment that has been submitted
    for the sole purpose of getting a link back to a specific website. The main reason
    why people submit spam comments is SEO. Generally speaking, in terms of SEO, the
    number of links pointing to a site is a known ranking factor, and website owners
    around the world do whatever they can to get as many links as possible. Unfortunately
    for us, sometimes it means using various spam methods as well.

- en: The way WordPress comments are set up by default makes it possible for anyone
    to get a link from your site just by submitting a comment and entering a website
    address in one of the comment fields. If they do so, and the comment gets approved,
    whatever was typed into the Name field of the comment becomes the text of the
    link, and the Website field becomes the link's destination.
