The reason behind your being unable to love PHP as a programming language was never trivial. Handling PHP without a strong IDE is no less tough than driving at night with the headlights off. It is always said that PHP is a loosely-typed language (God bless those who say this!), yet PHP errors are nightmarish—with all of those mysterious 500 errors, 403 errors, and the like.</p><p>But let us not forget that the error code definitely has a meaning. The Apache server is unable to interpret PHP as such, so it gives you an indication that probably the homework is incomplete and that you have to look into your PHP code and find the exact error yourself. You are left adrift in a leaky boat in a stormy ocean... sad!</p><p>To be able to come out of this stormy ocean with a leaky boat, you definitely need some aid: a patch, maybe some better material in the form of a good editor with some really smart intelligence; such intelligence will not only inform you about the error, but also help you a great deal in solving the problem. In short, you need a smart IDE, such as PhpStorm, to code in PHP just as the other creatures in the world of programming do.</p><p>PhpStorm <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>understands that programmers are not robots, and thus it leaves no stone unturned in making coding easier for them—be it the beautiful syntax highlighting, code formatting, language injection, error inspection, bookmarking lines of code, and all possible permutations and combinations of the thoughts that are currently coming to your mind. Yes, PhpStorm has a solution to all your coding woes, and it ensures that you can love PHP.</p><p>PhpStorm is created and maintained by<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>JetBrains</strong></span>, an organization with many similar products in other languages as well. The people at JetBrains respect every community of programmers, and hence they provide IDEs to many programming languages, including Java. PhpStorm is built using the Java programming language and has been carefully designed to be able to support almost all the common and uncommon tools that directly or indirectly provide assistance in programming.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>PhpStorm is an intelligent code editor that provides smart code completion, syntax highlighting, extended code formatting configuration, on-the-fly error checking, code folding, support for language mixtures, and so on.</p></div></div></div></div>

In case you wish to do some command-line activity, such as running some shell commands, setting some cron jobs or whatever, there is this command terminal available inside PhpStorm. Please remember the keyboard shortcut <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>F12</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The TODO view</strong></span>: To live<a id="id9" class="indexterm"/> the life of a programmer, you need to<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/> have multiple core processors to be time-bound; infinite cloud storage volume so that whatever is said to you is recorded somewhere eternally; and 32 GB of RAM so that no context switch pushes the active process out of the memory onto the disk. In short, you need to be Jarvis (Iron Man series). Wake up! You are still a human being with a natural tendency to start dreaming and hence stray from the main topic and forget the main course.<p>A TODO view in the PhpStorm IDE is a feature with which you can record your future plans to make changes in the code. This not only helps you (in most cases) to remember your plans but also to search for them later when required. A TODO feature is just a sticky note that has literally occupied all the space on your workbench. <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>6</em></span> in your sticky note, please.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The Project view</strong></span>: A <a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>project is analogous to a mechanic's <a id="id12" class="indexterm"/>workshop, where great things are made in a not-so-great-looking way. Your project contains all sorts of commented-out code, sample logics, test logics, and failed algorithms, which definitely make you smile at the end of the day when you turn off your computer and go home. In PhpStorm, the Project view is a hierarchical view that shows you the exact hierarchy your code has and what files are located at which node in the tree. In order to show the Project view, use <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The Favorites view</strong></span>: A <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>favorite is an item or a list that you need quite <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>frequently, so PhpStorm has provided a feature with which you can very easily look up those items. By default, PhpStorm provides three favorites: the bookmarks in your code, the debugger breakpoints in your code that you might have set, and a list containing other favorite items with the same name as you create your project in PhpStorm. The keyboard shortcut is <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>2</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The Structure view</strong></span>: What is more relieving to the mind and the soul than to see the entire <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>code in a consolidated format? The PhpStorm IDE provides a Structure view for code in such a way that all the methods are shown in the form of a list. This enables you to have greater control over the members of any class that you created and prevents namespace collision and method duplication. In order to open the Structure view, all you need to remember is the keyboard shortcut <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>7</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The Database view</strong></span>: Although <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>programming a database is one of the <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>most daunting tasks in the world of programming, PhpStorm eases off this pressure by adding a Database view to the system. It lets you view the database tables, the procedures stored in it, the data stored in it, and a number of general tasks related to databases, which would otherwise have required a dedicated application of its own. The database views can be shown or hidden by simple mouse clicks, as shown in the following recipes. You have the freedom to choose the database server of your choice—it could be a server running on your local system or something running over in the cloud over an IP address and protected by a username and password.</li></ul></div></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Maximizing views and editors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"/>Maximizing views and editors</h1></div></div></div><p>Although the IT industry is <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>flourishing, and candidates from all across the globe are making a living <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>by IT jobs as programmers, companies continue to be misers in the area of providing infrastructure and maintaining proper ergonomics for the programmers. A small monitor is one such ergonomic infrastructure problem. PhpStorm comes to the rescue.</p><p>There is a feature to maximize a view or editor at will. The views can be maximized (when in the docked mode) by the resize option available in the right-click context menu or in the settings menu. For easier handling, the mouse drag can also be handy. Just click and drag the required window to resize.</p><p>Good practice says that an editor should be the only object that should be kept visible at all times. The other views should be opened on demand and closed as soon as the task is done. The undocked mode is meant for this purpose. The view appears on demand and disappears as soon as another view or editor is clicked on.</p><p>There is an excellent feature available with PhpStorm that lets you concentrate solely on your coding by providing a fullscreen mode, which shows you only the PhpStorm window. Yes, you got it right. Only the PhpStorm window is visible, and no frame border or operating system items are visible.</p><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>To turn on this feature, you need to perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Enter Full Screen</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">To turn off, go to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Exit Full Screen</strong></span>. Wasn't that easy? Indeed.</li></ol></div><p>An even better feature provided by PhpStorm is the presentation mode. In this, you will only view the editor window with the fonts enlarged. All other features will be available, but only on demand. This is the best viewing option that can be provided by an IDE to work with small or single monitors.
