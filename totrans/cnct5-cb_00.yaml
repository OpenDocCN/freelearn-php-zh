- en: concrete5 is an increasingly popular open source content management system.
    concrete5 sets itself apart from other CMS applications with its easy to use point-and-click
    interface and multitude of features. Web developers love concrete5 because it
    is very easy to customize and build additional features in a relatively short
    time. This book aims to explain a variety of common programming tasks for concrete5
    developers in an easy to read recipe format.

- en: What you need for this book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Readers will need a copy of concrete5 running on a development (not production)
    server. This will allow readers to experiment with many different elements of
    the concrete5 API without disrupting normal website operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Readers will also need a code editor that is capable of editing the PHP files.
    This can be something like an advanced editor such as Adobe Dreamweaver or a basic
    text editor, such as Vim.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some chapters also deal with browsing and querying MySQL databases, so a query
    browsing tool is recommended. HeidiSQL (on Windows), Sequel Pro (on OS X), and
    MySQL Workbench (all platforms) are some great tools that provide advanced functionality
    while browsing databases.
