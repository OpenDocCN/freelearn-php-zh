- en: Now that we have learned dozens of concrete5 recipes, it is time to put them
    to practical use. Think of this chapter as one giant recipe, with the sole purpose
    of creating an image gallery add-on, which you can install on your concrete5 website
    and begin using right away. If you visit the website for this book, there is a
    complete download of the source code to help you out if you get stuck.

    5.6.1.2, though the code will technically work for any concrete5 after Version
    5.6\. If you'd like to follow along exactly, get a new version of concrete5 running
    on your development server and install the sample content with it. That will give
    us some pages and images to work with.

- en: You may recall from [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Working with Themes and
    Add-ons"), *Working with Themes and Add-Ons*, that packages only require one file,
    the `controller`. The `controller` file contains methods that tell concrete5 what
    the package's name is, and a text description of the package.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few things we need to make note of here. First, notice the class
    name of the controller. Since our package handle is `cookbook_gallery`, we need
    to camel case that handle and append the package to the end, to create the class
    name that concrete5 can predict and load correctly.
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next thing we need is the `defined` or `die` statement at the top of the
    file. This is a special security requirement of concrete5 to ensure that scripts
    cannot be executed arbitrarily. Everything has to get run through the concrete5
    dispatcher. This statement is required at the top of every `.php` (excluding third-party
    libraries that exist in `libraries/3rd_party`) file in your package if you plan
    on submitting the package to the concrete5 marketplace.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing that we need to pay attention to is that all public facing strings
    are encased in the `t()` function (see the package name and description). The
    `t()` function, as discussed in [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. System Events
    and Advanced Configuration"), *System Events and Advanced Configuration* allows
    translators to supply alternate translations for the given string. This is another
    requirement for add-ons to be submitted into the concrete5 marketplace.

    added to any page in the concrete5 site, and will show an image gallery wherever
    it is placed. The first thing we will need to do is create the block's directory.
    Add a new directory in `/packages/cookbook_gallery/blocks`. Inside the new block's
    directory, add a directory called `cookbook_gallery`. This will contain our block's
    files.

    create the defined tables when the block type is installed.

    field. Save this `db.xml` file, and you can close it if you'd like, as we won't

    a shared template that both views will include, called `form.php`. Oh, why not
    create `view.css` as well, since our view file will need to use some styles.

    controllers employ the use of callbacks, which are functions in the class that
    get automatically executed when certain things happen. Whenever a block is added
    to a page for the first time, concrete5 will call the `add` function when the
    `add.php` view is displayed. The same goes for the `edit` function and the `edit.php`
    view.
  id: totrans-60
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not create a function that they each can use? The `addEdit` function contains
    the real code for our backend work.

    we transform this list of file sets into a simple key/value array that we can
    feed into a select box in the HTML form. Lastly, we send the array of `<select>`
    options to the view as the variable `$sets`.
  id: totrans-62

    There's a callback for that, too.

  id: totrans-66

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we load the file set object, based on the file set ID that we will set
    in the add/edit form. Using the file set object, we are able to filter the set
    to only show us files that are in that set. We don't want all types of files appearing
    though (imagine a PDF in the image gallery—that's no fun!), so we add another
    filter to only show us images.

    Or if the gallery had multiple pages? This block type is a great starting point
