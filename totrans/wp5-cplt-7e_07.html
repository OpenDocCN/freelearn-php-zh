<p>The role of plugins has grown a lot in recent years. Nowadays, it's hard to imagine any WordPress site that could operate without at least a handful of (essential) plugins installed.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will get to know what plugins are, why to use them, how to use them, where to get them, and how to be up to date with any new useful plugins that get released to the community. We will also talk about some of the most basic and popular plugins in the WordPress world, and why having them might be a good idea. Okay, let's get on with it!</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking down plugins</li>
<li>Installing a plugin</li>
<li>The must-have pack of plugins</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply speaking, plugins are small scripts (files with executable PHP code) that allow you to include new functionality in your WordPress site—functionality that is <em>not</em> available or enabled by default. One of the best advantages of WordPress is that it's quite an optimized platform. It makes your site load fast and doesn't contain much redundant code. However, WordPress itself only offers the absolute essential range of features—the features that are useful to everyone. At the same time, the platform provides a straightforward way of expanding the abilities of your site by introducing, you guessed it, plugins. The idea is simple—if you want your site to be able to handle a specific new task, there's undoubtedly a plugin for that. Much like in the Apple world and the popular expression, <em>there's an app for that</em>.</p>

<p>The best thing about plugins is that you don't need any specific programming knowledge to use them. Essentially, they are just like standard applications for iOS or Android— you can install them and enjoy the things they have to offer without knowing what's going on inside. This being said, not all plugins are safe to use in regards to data security or code quality. We will discuss this topic later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the right combination of plugins can make your site more optimized, more user-friendly, more attractive, more social media friendly, properly backed up, protected against spam, and, ultimately, unique. Plugins really are one of the best things about WordPress.</p>
<p>Before content management systems like WordPress were popularized, there was no easy way for site owners to introduce new functionalities to their sites. Doing so always required hiring a professional programmer and investing in the whole development process. Nowadays, this is no longer the case, and virtually anyone can have an impressive site without losing their shirt.</p>

<p>The community behind WordPress plugins is a huge one. There's not a central plugin-building company or anything. Developers all over the world create plugins and then distribute them across the internet. And, very often, they receive no direct compensation whatsoever. The best and the safest place to visit for WordPress plugins is the official directory at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/</a>:<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a5a2b765-4788-4ee6-b564-f5d1b391619a.png" width="1222" height="501"/></p>
<p>There are more than 55,000 different plugins available in the directory at the time of writing this book, and that number is constantly expanding, with around 100+ new plugins being added every week. This is really impressive because many of those plugins are very advanced pieces of web software and not just simple, one-script add-ons.</p>
<p>There's a search field available in the center of the page in the directory (visible in the preceding screenshot), which allows you to search plugins by topic and by tag. You can also view a list of the most popular plugins as well as featured plugins. In short, the official plugin directory is where you should always go first when looking for a plugin. It's also a good habit to always check how popular the plugins you're interested in are. Downloading plugins that already have a proven track record of happy users will improve your chances of getting a quality product that you'll enjoy using. This is really important since your site security should never be underestimated. By getting your plugins from the official WordPress directory, you can at least be certain that the plugins are not malicious in any way. We'll talk more about website security in the next chapter.</p>
<p>You can also carry out Google searches when looking for plugins on a per-task basis. I recommend searching for the problem you're trying to solve and see what plugins other users recommend and why. Often, multiple plugins perform similar functions, and you will find feedback from other WordPress users valuable in choosing between them. However, as you do this, be sure to keep an eye out for malicious or poorly coded plugins that could break your website or allow someone to hack into it. Be careful when installing new plugins with no reviews, comments, or feedback from users, in addition to those plugins that have bad feedback about them on the internet.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">To get even more in-depth into your plugin investigation, you can also check out the change logs and support forums for each plugin you're considering for your site (every plugin page inside the official <kbd>plugin</kbd> directory has a tab labeled <span class="packt_screen">Support</span>). This should give you an idea of how well or how poorly a given plugin is coded, supported, and so on.</div>
<p>Apart from free plugins, there's also a big set of premium plugins (paid ones). However, you won't find them in the official directory. Most of those plugins have their own websites for handling sales, customer support, and usage tutorials. If you're interested, one of the more popular premium plugin directories can be found at <a href="https://codecanyon.net/category/wordpress">https://codecanyon.net/category/wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, if a given plugin proves that it's a quality solution and gains some popularity, it will be showcased on the home page of the official directory in the <span class="packt_screen">Featured Plugins</span> section. But if you want to be up to date with things as they happen, you can pay attention to what's going on at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/new/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/new/</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a great way to discover new plugins is to become a regular on the popular blogs about WordPress. Although these blogs are not official creations (they are run by independent owners), they do provide an impressive range of tips and advice, not only on plugins, but also on other aspects related to WordPress. The list includes the following:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing a plugin – how to go about this</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The steps for installing a plugin are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find your plugin</li>
<li>Download it to your WordPress site, either manually or through the automatic installer</li>
<li>Install and activate it</li>
<li>Configure it (if necessary)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two ways to get the plugin into your WordPress installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install it manually</li>
<li>Install it directly from within <kbd>wp-admin</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>The first option—installing plugins manually—generally requires a bit more effort than the second one, but sometimes it's the only way to work with certain plugins (mostly premium ones). The second option—installing from within the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>—is generally quicker and easier, but it's not possible in all cases. You need to be on a server that's configured correctly, in a way that lets WordPress add files (we talked about installing WordPress and server configuration in <a href="2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml">Chapter 2</a><em>, Getting Started with WordPress</em>). Plus, the plugin you want to install has to be available in the WordPress plugin repository, that is, the official plugin directory.</p>
<p>In the following section, we'll go over the auto-installation first (since it's easier to do), and then handle the manual method.</p>

<p>If the plugin you want to install is available in the official plugin directory at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/</a>, then you can search for and install the plugin from within <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. Just navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>. You will find a search field in the top-right corner. Type in your desired plugin's name there (as shown in the following screenshot):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cfd66109-b444-4f25-a66e-9479d676e5e2.png" width="1844" height="647"/></p>
<p>Once you see your plugin, click on the <span class="packt_screen">More Details</span> link to see some more information about the features it has to offer:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f53ec1d7-2304-4212-b132-cd19373e09af.png" width="1060" height="865"/></p>
<p>I recommend you always look at this information carefully. Be sure to watch for version compatibility. There's a parameter labeled <span class="packt_screen">Compatible up to</span> listed with the plugin's details. In some cases, you can risk installing a plugin that's a little outdated, but you should proceed with caution. It's also a good idea to have a glance at the number of downloads a plugin has had. The more downloads, the more people had the chance to take a look at the plugin and evaluate its quality.</p>
<p>After installation, you need to test the plugin carefully and verify that it's behaving correctly. Most of the time, if the <span class="packt_screen">Compatible up to</span> parameter indicates an older version of WordPress, it doesn't necessarily mean that the plugin will fail to work with a newer version. It just means that it hasn't been thoroughly tested, hence the importance of performing your own tests. However, I strongly advise against installing any plugins that haven't been updated in more than two years. Luckily, whenever you encounter such a plugin, WordPress itself will either warn you through a message on the official plugin page, as shown in the following screenshot, or, inside the plugin details section in <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, there will be a parameter labeled <span class="packt_screen">Last Updated</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e759be2f-6f08-455b-966b-86895fb2309f.png" width="889" height="81"/></p>
<p>If everything is fine, you can proceed by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Install Now</span> button. After a couple of seconds, you will be able to activate the plugin. You'll see the <span class="packt_screen">Activate</span> button that will appear. Consult with the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/13bb6033-deb4-48a2-bd78-4ec517530b36.png" style="width:41.92em;height:17.00em;" width="778" height="317"/></p>
<p>At this point, the plugin has been installed and activated. In other words, it should be fully operational.</p>

<p>The following procedure allows you to install any WordPress plugin you can get your hands on, irrespective of whether it comes from the official directory at WordPress.org (<a href="https://wordpress.org/">https://wordpress.org/</a>) or elsewhere.</p>
<p>To install a plugin manually, you must start by downloading the plugin archive either from the official directory at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/</a> or from another website or source (usually when dealing with premium plugins).</p>
<p>In this case, the Jetpack plugin is available in the official directory at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/967c2171-930a-4fa8-8dbb-e9d92a8cdba4.png" style="width:31.58em;height:18.17em;" width="772" height="445"/></p>
<p>Just click on the blue <span class="packt_screen">Download</span> button and save the resulting ZIP file on your computer in a place where you can find it easily. Once you have the plugin downloaded, and if your server is set up correctly, you should be able to upload the ZIP file directly via the <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> page. Go to that page, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Upload Plugin</span> button at the top, and choose the ZIP file of the plugin, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/d576e0f5-4541-40d2-b993-092fa7aeaa3b.png" style="width:28.25em;height:9.08em;" width="713" height="231"/></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If this automatic uploader doesn't work for you, you can do it the old-fashioned way. First unzip, that is, extract the ZIP file you downloaded so that it's a directory, probably named <kbd>jetpack</kbd> (at least in this case). Then, using your FTP client, upload this directory inside the <kbd>wp-content/plugins/</kbd> directory of your WordPress installation. You'll also see the two plugins in that directory that WordPress came with—<kbd>akismet</kbd> and <kbd>hello.php</kbd>.<br/>
If you need any assistance with FTP software, review <a href="2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml">Chapter 2</a><em>, Getting Started with WordPress</em>, where we talked about the topic of installing WordPress.</div>
<p>After the upload finishes, you will be able to activate the plugin. This is required to effectively turn the plugin on. This can be done by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Activate Plugin</span> button, as shown in the following screenshot. At this point, you're done, and the Jetpack plugin is working:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9e164d09-ec4f-46f9-b8dc-88685076c0cc.png" style="width:41.58em;height:12.25em;" width="1276" height="377"/></p>

<p>With your plugin installed and ready to go, there's just one more thing that you might want to do. While some plugins are perfectly functional right after activation, others require some additional tuning. The following are the four most likely scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not have to do anything. Some plugins simply change the way WordPress does certain things, and activating them is all you have to do.</li>
<li>You may have to configure the plugin before it begins to work. Some plugins need you to make choices and set new settings.</li>
<li>You may also get a set of shortcodes or other elements that you can use to include additional content that the plugin provides inside your posts or pages.</li>
<li>There may not be a configuration page, but you may have to add some code to one of your theme's template files.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're unsure of what to do after you've uploaded and activated your plugin, be sure to read the README file that most likely came with the plugin or look at the FAQ on the plugin's website.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Many plugin authors accept donations. I strongly recommend giving donations to the authors of the plugins that you find useful. It helps to encourage everyone in the community to continue writing great plugins that everyone can use. Even if you can only donate a small amount, it will still count. Think how much time you saved thanks to the developer of your favorite plugin. If it's significant, maybe you should indeed consider donating.</div>

<p>Even though there are more than 55,000 plugins available in the official directory, you surely don't need all of them on your WordPress site at the same time. There is a small set that we might call the <em>must-have pack</em>. My list of must-have plugins can be different from the next guy's, so treat the following information more as guidance rather than as a written-in-stone necessity. That being said, if I am honest here, and despite the fact that some of my blogs feature more than 25 plugins all working at the same time, the essential must-have list consists of only seven plugins. All these plugins handle a specific task geared toward making a WordPress site better and more functional.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Backing up</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Backing up is probably the most critical task for any website owner, and I'm saying this in all seriousness. For instance, can you imagine a situation in which you lose your whole site overnight with no ability to restore it? This might sound a bit hard to believe right now, but it does happen. If it's a personal blog you've been running, then it's not that tragic. But for a business website, it's an entirely different story.</p>
<p>So, one of the main problems with backing up is that it's only effective if it's done regularly. In other words, you need to create backups often and keep them somewhere safe. While that's all fine, who has the time to do this manually? No one, honestly. That's why we'll be using a plugin that does its magic in the background without any supervision required on our part—introducing <strong>UpdraftPlus</strong>—a WordPress backup plugin, available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5f30dc3c-ad59-489c-8d30-e47103750c09.png" style="width:39.17em;height:17.67em;" width="979" height="442"/></p>
<p>This plugin allows you to handle website backups in an easy to grasp and hassle-free way. It connects with your remote storage account, such as Dropbox (but there are more possibilities here), and then backs up your site regularly on autopilot. It requires only minimal initial setup.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up to Dropbox for free at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">https://www.dropbox.com/</a>. As part of the free package, you get 2 GB disk space, which will be more than enough to keep your site backed up.</div>
<p>Here are the steps necessary to integrate UpdraftPlus with Dropbox. After installing and activating the plugin, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">UpdraftPlus Backups</span> in your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, and then switch to the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> tab. There, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Dropbox</span> logo:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/79258b32-e731-4893-84ad-6d0e052a704d.png" style="width:48.25em;height:16.67em;" width="1299" height="450"/></p>
<p>Right after clicking on the logo, scroll down and click on the main <span class="packt_screen">Save Changes</span> button. This will reload the page, and you'll see a notification that additional authorization with Dropbox is required, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/269f45f1-a0ae-4fb6-a4c2-b8c6fc5af437.png" style="width:45.92em;height:11.00em;" width="1383" height="331"/></p>
<p>Just click on the link in the notification, and you'll be taken to the Dropbox authorization page. To proceed, you'll need to log in to your Dropbox account and then confirm the authorization. After a couple of seconds, you will be redirected back to your site and your settings will be in place. At this stage, you have integrated the plugin with Dropbox. All that needs doing now is telling the plugin to back up your website automatically.</p>
<p>Go back to the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> tab of the plugin. The two fields to pay attention to now are the following ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Files backup schedule</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database backup schedule</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This depends on your personal preference, but for a website that doesn't publish multiple entries every day, setting the former to <span class="packt_screen">Weekly</span> and the latter to <span class="packt_screen">Daily</span> is going to be just fine, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cfd3c124-a4c7-4ab2-aee8-b8853cfeba4a.png" style="width:43.33em;height:11.08em;" width="1296" height="332"/></p>
<p>With this plugin, you can also trigger backups manually (on top of the backup scheduling feature). Doing so is a good idea when you first install the plugin, just to check whether everything's working fine and to have your initial backup done. You can start the backup in <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">UpdraftPlus Backups</span>. You will be presented with the following screen:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/60d4e0b9-ae6d-4386-85ba-d77a957bd15c.png" style="width:43.25em;height:14.17em;" width="1325" height="432"/></p>
<p>All you need to do is just click on the big <span class="packt_screen">Backup Now</span> button.</p>

                </header>

<p>Google Analytics is a very popular site stats and analytics solution. It's free, easy to use for a beginner, and very powerful for anyone willing to get into it a little more deeply. In short, Google Analytics lets you in on a set of stats and data regarding the web traffic your site is getting, including things such as the exact number of visitors (daily, monthly, and so on), traffic sources, your most popular content, and a virtual myriad of other statistics. Google Analytics is available at <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">https://www.google.com/analytics/</a>.</p>
<p>To enable Google Analytics on your site, you have to sign up for a Google account first, enable <span class="packt_screen">Analytics</span>, and then add your site in the control panel (all available on the official Google Analytics page, along with extensive tutorial documentation). Next, take the tracking code that Google gives you and include it on your site. This last step is where the <span class="packt_screen">Google Analytics for WordPress by MonsterInsights</span> plugin comes into play and makes the whole thing a lot simpler. You can get it at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7781c2ef-b8da-4d4c-a655-20c46617cc16.png" style="width:29.67em;height:14.17em;" width="965" height="460"/></p>
<p>Once you download and activate it, proceed to <span class="packt_screen">Insights</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>. Although the plugin has a lot of settings, the only thing you must do to make it work is to authenticate the plugin so that you can enable a connection with your Google Analytics account. Just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Authenticate with your Google account</span> button:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/713c7849-79b2-4767-ac2e-9fb873c5fbb2.png" width="1199" height="207"/></p>
<p>This will redirect you to a page on Google where you have to click on another button, <span class="packt_screen">Grant access</span>, and then you'll be taken back to your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. Now, you can select what's called your <em>UA-profile</em>, which is what you want to use for monitoring the site. If you're having problems with this semi-automatic way of authentication, you can simply input your Google Analytics code (called the UA code) manually. This code is visible in your profile at Google Analytics (it usually begins with <kbd>UA-</kbd> and is followed by nine numbers).</p>
<p>Once you're done with the authentication procedure, your site is fully connected to Google Analytics and the traffic stats are being collected. After a while, you can navigate to your profile in Google Analytics and see how your site's been doing in terms of visitor popularity. Also, to get a more immediate indication of whether the tracking code has been set correctly or not, you can navigate to the <span class="packt_screen">Real-Time</span> traffic section inside Google Analytics.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Caching</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To be honest, caching is a pretty complicated concept. If you speak <em>engineering</em>, then here's the definition: <em>in computer science, a cache is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster</em>. What it means in plain English is that if you have caching enabled on your site, it will load faster and be much more accessible for your audience/visitors. Luckily, even though the concept itself is not that straightforward, the plugin that enables you to <em>cache</em> is. Currently, the top of the line plugin is called <strong>W3 Total Cache</strong>, and is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1717e59b-e3de-42d1-8998-c964920c84bb.png" style="width:44.00em;height:20.08em;" width="964" height="440"/></p>
<p>And it's not just me recommending it. Actually, a number of major hosting companies and experts say that it provides <em>the</em> way to get your site optimized fast. More than that, the plugin is also in use on some major blogs around the web.</p>
<p>The installation procedure is the same as with any WordPress plugin. But right after you activate it, you'll see that the usage is quite different. For one, it's accessible through a completely new section in the left sidebar. It's labeled <span class="packt_screen">Performance</span>, and it's placed right below <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>. Less than a second after you click on it, you will realize that this plugin is a huge one. It could probably have a completely separate book written about it. So here, I will only provide a quick start guide, so to speak.</p>
<p>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Performance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">General Settings</span>, and browse through the page. There are a number of checkboxes labeled <span class="packt_screen">Enable</span>. Just to get started with the plugin, I advise you to enable (check the following checkbox) the following blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Page Cache</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database Cache</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Object Cache</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Browser Cache</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, click on any of the <span class="packt_screen">Save all settings</span> buttons. From now on, caching will be fully enabled on your site and your visitors should start experiencing performance improvements right away. Obviously, we've only touched on the possibilities and customizations that this plugin brings to the table, so I encourage you to give it a closer look in your spare time.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Search engine optimization</strong> (<strong>SEO</strong>) is one of the most popular topics online (at least among website owners). The simple truth is that working on your site's SEO, if done right, will raise its position in search engines (such as Google) and will bring you more visitors on a daily basis. The concept is pretty simple in theory, but the work involved to achieve this can become a full-time job. If you're not interested in devoting a big chunk of your time to SEO, then, at the very least, get the <strong>Yoast SEO</strong> plugin, available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/</a>, and have the basics handled. The plugin is very popular in the blogosphere, and it's in use on some of the most popular blogs out there:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9f039198-ce71-4c9f-b446-8f64df3776cc.png" style="width:31.83em;height:14.58em;" width="970" height="445"/></p>
<p>Similar to the previous plugin, W3 Total Cache, this one has a custom section within <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> too. It's visible right below <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>, and it's called <span class="packt_screen">SEO</span>. The best way to get the core how-to on this plugin is to go through the configuration wizard. You'll see the link leading to it right after visiting the plugin's section, <span class="packt_screen">SEO,</span> in the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/81cd89e3-f7b2-4583-987b-e0c34fdca382.png" style="width:35.67em;height:17.50em;" width="853" height="418"/></p>
<p>The wizard is really well made and it'll take you step by step through the whole configuration phase of the plugin, along with its most basic settings and features. I really encourage you to spend a while optimizing your site with this plugin because this work will surely pay off in the long run, or maybe even much sooner:</p>

<div class="packt_tip">There's a separate resource that was published by the author of the WordPress SEO plugin—Joost de Valk. It's where you should go to get further in-depth information on how to set up the plugin and what else you can do to make your site SEO-friendly.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Social media integration</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Social media has taken the online space by storm and, these days, we can hardly imagine a website existing without at least some level of social media integration. The benefits of such integration are clearly visible. With a good social media plugin for WordPress, you will be able to share your posts with friends and family on all of the most popular social platforms out there. More than that, your readers will be able to do it too, effectively growing your audience and making your site more popular. Ultimately, publishing content that goes viral on social media can skyrocket your traffic and make your site visible to thousands of new people every week, or even every day.</p>
<p>So, the way we're going to make it easier for your readers (and you) to share your content is by displaying some social media buttons on your site, and more accurately, on each post and page that your site consists of.</p>
<p>The social media plugin called <span class="packt_screen">Simple Social Media Share Buttons</span> is a great free solution that gives you the requisite functionality. It is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/</a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/">:</a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b337261f-0c75-4267-ae74-96bb92515449.png" style="width:39.08em;height:18.58em;" width="959" height="457"/></p>
<p>After installing and activating it, you can go to the plugin's settings section in <span class="packt_screen">Social Buttons</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>. There, you can review the default settings that the plugin comes with out of the box. The good news is that if you don't want to deal with any of those, you can just leave things as they are—all of the settings are optional. If you do want to play around, however, you can change a load of things about how social media buttons are presented on your site:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9d1a6413-dd9f-4a89-b6ba-ee0ee9f84cca.png" style="width:55.75em;height:56.17em;" width="1336" height="1345"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is really easy to grasp, lets you pick from a range of different social networks, and also gives you some basic customization options (such as changing the size of the buttons, their position on the page, and whether or not you want the share counter to be displayed). When you're done experimenting with the settings, click on <span class="packt_screen">Save Changes</span>.</p>
<p>For example, the settings I have selected in my setup include only Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn buttons, plus a slick minimal theme to make those buttons stand out. Here's what they look like under a blog post:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/aef20048-5e2f-41b9-bdb9-e0947304035f.png" style="width:42.08em;height:30.00em;" width="1089" height="776"/></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This mysterious name is exactly what one of the most popular plugins of today is called. Jetpack, by the guys behind WordPress.com, offers a truly exceptional range of features and functionalities. The plugin consists of a number of modules that can be enabled or disabled one by one. This gives you full control over the features you want and don't want to use. Jetpack is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6f21e349-5bc5-4624-a294-1928aff08cd5.png" style="width:38.58em;height:22.00em;" width="781" height="445"/></p>
<p>After downloading and activating it, you'll see a new section in <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, but this time, it's right below <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cfabfe7d-61dc-4136-a060-3ece4140db8a.png" style="width:10.08em;height:14.58em;" width="227" height="329"/></p>
<p>Inside, you can see all of the available modules and functionalities. First, you should navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Jetpack</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> to enable or disable the modules you need/don't need. There are over 30 modules there, so you have a lot to choose from. Luckily, they've been grouped into a handful of categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Writing</span>: Everything that makes writing content easier, together with settings for site speed-up</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Sharing</span>: Some additional social media integration</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Discussion</span>: Tools that help your readers discuss and interact with your content</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Traffic</span>: Tools and settings that help you monitor the traffic that your website is getting</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Security</span>: Backups, added security, and spam protection</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't go over each of the modules here in detail because it would probably require a chapter of its own. Instead, I encourage you to click on the name of each module you'd like to look into and get all the info yourself. In general, each of the modules is quite user-friendly, so you shouldn't experience any trouble during installation or using them later on.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Comment spam</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Comment spam is one of the most annoying things on the internet if you're an online publisher. Basically, a spam comment is a comment that has been submitted for the sole purpose of getting a link back to a specific website. The main reason why people submit spam comments is SEO. Generally speaking, in terms of SEO, the number of links pointing to a site is a known ranking factor, and website owners around the world do whatever they can to get as many links as possible. Unfortunately for us, sometimes it means using various spam methods as well.</p>
<p>The way WordPress comments are set up by default makes it possible for anyone to get a link from your site just by submitting a comment and entering a website address in one of the comment fields. If they do so, and the comment gets approved, whatever was typed into the <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> field of the comment becomes the text of the link, and the <span class="packt_screen">Website</span> field becomes the link's destination.</p>
<p>The worst thing about comment spam is that once your site gets even remotely popular, you can start getting hundreds of spam comments a day; hence, dealing with them by hand becomes almost impossible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, fighting comment spam is not something built into WordPress by default. This means that you have to get some plugin(s) to enable this functionality. For now, let's focus on the most popular spam protection plugin out there—Akismet. The good thing about this is that it comes along with the standard WordPress installation incorporated directly, so you should be able to find it in the <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> section in your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. The only thing you need to do is activate it.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Working with Akismet</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Right after you activate the plugin, you'll see a prompt in the top section of your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. Click on the big button that's in it:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/2487c39d-3ad1-4bf2-b6f0-88574c585062.png" style="width:70.00em;height:30.08em;" width="1568" height="673"/></p>
<p>The Akismet plugin requires that you have a special API key. Getting this API key isn't something particularly difficult, but we still need to go through a couple of steps. First, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Get your API key</span> button:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1bc5484c-220b-4dfa-8e0e-32fce5ba0bed.png" style="width:34.42em;height:9.42em;" width="731" height="202"/></p>
<p>You will be redirected to akismet.com (<a href="https://akismet.com/">https://akismet.com/</a>), where you will be able to complete the process. The on-screen instructions are very clear and take you through everything step by step. To get started, you first need a WordPress.com profile account. If you don't have one yet, you will be prompted to create it. Nothing fancy—just standard information is needed during signup. We covered this in an earlier chapter.</p>
<p>Once you do have the account and begin setting up Akismet, the thing you should pay special attention to is the specific subscription plan that you're going to select. At the time of writing, there are three available: Basic (free), Plus ($5), and Enterprise ($50). To get standard spam protection, you can confidently go with Basic, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c389f202-828a-42bd-aa74-d35ae85e9642.png" width="1369" height="827"/></p>
<p>Now, this is tricky. The plan you've selected is based on voluntary donations. If you're not willing to spend any money, just take the slider that's in the center and slide it to the left, all the way to $0.00/yr:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/23fc9b36-27ec-44f9-aea1-34d4fab996a1.png" style="width:42.67em;height:22.17em;" width="1060" height="550"/></p>
<p>After clicking on the final activation link, you will be redirected back to your WordPress website, and the API key is going to be already in the right field in Akismet settings.</p>
<p>If you're feeling confident, you can check the box labeled <span class="packt_screen">Silently discard the worst and most pervasive spam so I never see it</span>. Akismet is relatively good at identifying which comment is actually spam, and checking this box will make those comments disappear. However, if you're concerned about Akismet misidentifying comments, leave this unchecked. All you have to do is click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save Changes</span> button, and your blog is now protected from comment spam! This is demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6de2eba1-560a-4b4d-8dc7-0cc754690f65.png" style="width:42.67em;height:18.67em;" width="872" height="381"/></p>

<p>This chapter was all about expanding the features available on your site and making your content more attractive without the need to touch any source code. Basically, that's the whole idea behind plugins.</p>
<p>Some developers might not need plugins because they can code things on their own. However, for the rest of the world, plugins are what makes WordPress easy to use and attractive for everyone.</p>
<p>At this point, we know how to control the content of our WordPress site, but that's only the beginning. In the next chapter, we will learn how to take care of basic website security and prevent hackers from taking over our sites.</p>
