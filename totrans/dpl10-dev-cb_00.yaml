- en: Drupal is a popular content management system used to build websites for small
    businesses, e-commerce, enterprise systems, and much more. Created by over 4,500
    contributors, Drupal 10 brings many new features to Drupal. Whether you are new
    to Drupal or an experienced Drupalista, *Drupal 10 Development Cookbook* contains
    recipes to dive into what Drupal 10 has to offer. We begin by helping you create
    and maintain your Drupal site. Next, familiarize yourself with configuring content
    structure and editing content. You can also find out about all new updates for
    this edition. These include creating custom pages, accessing and manipulating
    entities, running and creating tests using Drupal, and migrating external data
    to Drupal. As you progress, you'll learn how to customize Drupal's functionality
    using out-of-the-box modules, provide extensions, and write custom code to extend
    Drupal. You will also learn how to design a digital experience platform with robust
    content management and editorial workflows.

    plugins, entity types, and pages. You can also power your Drupal site with modern
    front-end development build tools. You'll be able to create and manage code bases
    for Drupal sites. You can take advantage of Drupal by making Drupal your API platform,
    and serving content to your consumers.
