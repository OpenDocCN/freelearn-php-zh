			<p>A foundational part of any assessment strategy in an online course often relies heavily on different types of automatically scoring quizzes. However, quizzes can often be the Achilles heel of a course or educational program if they are not designed well, and do not tie in well with overall course learning objectives. Planning with storyboarding is critical. Furthermore, in an environment where there is a need for "live" (synchronous) lectures via Zoom, Teams, BigBlueButton, or other platforms, quizzes are often overlooked. Nevertheless, they can be an ideal way to take stock of how and where the students are concerning learning goals, and to keep them engaged. </p>
			<p>A well-designed use of quizzes can help learners achieve learning objectives, and they also satisfy <strong class="bold">Universal Design for Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">UDL</strong>) guidelines that have to do with building a structure for student success. Quizzes can help with goal setting, self-regulation, and developing a positive "I can do it!", believe-in-yourself attitude (self-efficacy). </p>
			<p>Moodle 4.0's redesigned look and feel, as well as its responsive themes, make it easy to use on many different devices, including smartphones. This fact is critical because many learners will be relying on their phones to do coursework, particularly in situations where they cannot access the Moodle course on a laptop or desktop. In situations where learners are relying on cell phones, it's important to use assessment strategies that can display well on small screens. In that case, Moodle's Quiz activity is ideal, particularly for multiple-choice quizzes.</p>
			<p>Coupled with certificates and badges to be awarded once mastery has been demonstrated, quizzes can be a key building block for academic and career milestones. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will examine how Moodle offers a powerful solution that allows well-designed and well-placed quizzes, and the ability to tie the quizzes in with mastery learning, competency frameworks, certificates, and badges. In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Develop graded assignments</li>
				<li>Create quizzes with question banks</li>
				<li>Integrate certificates and badges</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After completing this chapter, you'll know which strategies to use for Quiz activities in Moodle. You'll also have a foundational knowledge of how to develop different types of quizzes and how to write effective questions.  </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor719"/>Moodle 4.0's Quiz activity</h1>
			<p>In Moodle 4.0, <strong class="bold">Quiz</strong> is a powerful and highly<a id="_idIndexMarker559"/> flexible activity that allows you to achieve<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> learning objectives by creating assessment tools ranging from simple, multiple-choice tests to complex, self-assessment tasks with detailed feedback. The following screenshot shows the newly redesigned icon for Quiz in Moodle 4.0:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – Icon for the Quiz activity in Moodle 4.0</p>
			<p>As is the case with all resources and activities in Moodle, once you have turned on <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the top right-hand corner and selected <strong class="bold">Add activity or resource</strong>, select <strong class="bold">Quiz</strong>. You will see a screen called <strong class="bold">Updating: Quiz</strong>, which will include the fields you need to complete to add a name and description, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>

			<p>Once you've created your Quiz<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> description, scroll down the page to see the other aspects of the Quiz activity<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> that you will configure. Each topic is clickable and opens a screen that allows you to customize the quiz. The following is what you will see when you scroll down the screen:  </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – Categories of settings you can use to configure your Quiz</p>
			<p>Now that we know where<a id="_idIndexMarker563"/> to find the Quiz activity, what it looks like, and<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> the basic options, let's look at the best way to use quizzes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor720"/>Developing graded assessments using quizzes</h1>
			<p>As you put together your lessons<a id="_idIndexMarker565"/> and assignments, you will need<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> an assessment strategy. In online courses, it is very useful to be able to incorporate self-grading quizzes. Moodle offers a flexible quiz builder. Each question can include any valid HTML code, such as graphics, formatted text, and media. A question can include anything that you can put on a Moodle resource p<a id="_idTextAnchor721"/>age.</p>
			<p>In most instructor-led courses, a quiz<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> or test is a major event. Handing<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> out the quizzes, taking them in the middle of a class, and grading them can take up a lot of the teacher's time. In Moodle, creating, taking, and grading quizzes can be much faster. This means that you can use quizzes liberally throughout your courses. Here are some instances<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> where you can use quizzes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can use a short quiz after each reading assignment to ensure that the students complete the reading. You can shuffle the questions and answers to prevent sharing among the students. You can also make the quiz available only for the week/month in which the students are supposed to complete the reading.</li>
				<li>You can use a quiz as a practice test. You can allow several attempts and/or use adaptive mode to allow students to attempt a question until they get it right. Then, the quiz functions both as practice and learning material.</li>
				<li>You can use a quiz as a pretest to confirm prior learning, as well as for determining where there is a knowledge or skills gap. You can ask the students to complete a quiz even before they come to the course. The students can complete this pretest at a time and place that is convenient for them. Then, you can compare their scores on the pretest and final test to show that learning has occurred. The skills gap analysis that you will have can help you measure the effectiveness of the course.</li>
				<li>You can use a quiz in conjunction with mastery learning to help students achieve the minimum score to demonstrate mastery.</li>
				<li>You can tie quiz scores/performance to competency frameworks to help satisfy institutional or accreditation requirements.</li>
				<li>You can automatically generate badges and certificates based on the ach<a id="_idTextAnchor722"/>ievement of certain scores. Note that you can restrict access to further modules, courses, resources, or activities<a id="_idIndexMarker570"/> until a sufficiently high quiz score has been achieved. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>In Moodle, after setting up a new Quiz, you will need to develop a question bank. The kinds of questions you develop<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> depend on the type of Quiz you've decided<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> to use, depending on your instructional strategy. You'll want to develop a sufficient number of questions to allow you to rotate the questions and assure academic honesty. </p>
			<p>The Quiz activity includes several different types of quizzes, but we will start with multiple choice because it is the one you are likely to use the most. To be effective, you should follow psychometric standards, which can be complicated. We will provide easy-to-follow guidelines here, which will help you write multiple-choice questions that you can feel confident about. Now, let's start building a question bank, where you will store your classified and tagged questions that correspond to the kind of quiz you plan to a<a id="_idTextAnchor723"/>dminister.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor724"/>Building question banks</h1>
			<p>Let's build a question bank. Building<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> the quiz is a three-step process. First, create a quiz. Second, create questions in the question bank. Third, add questions to the quiz. You can create the questions first, but it is often best to storyboard your course and list the Quiz activities first. </p>
			<p>Moodle 4.0 makes it easier to access question bank global configurations by accessing them through plugins. There are three question-related areas: <strong class="bold">Question bank plugins</strong>, <strong class="bold">Question behaviors</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Question types</strong>. You can enable site-wide access, and also configure the behaviors across the site by making changes on the <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> page. </p>
			<p>A question bank in Moodle is a collection of questions that you can organize in different ways in a database so that you can use them in the future. You'll use your questions in different "contexts" – some will be used across the entire system. Others would be used in all quizzes in a course category. Others would be used in a course, and others would be used only in a single quiz. You can also think of it as a tree of categories. </p>
			<p>So, let's get started! The question<a id="_idIndexMarker574"/> bank is a collection of questions and corresponds to one of four contexts. The contexts are <em class="italic">system</em>, <em class="italic">course category</em>, <em class="italic">course</em>, and <em class="italic">quiz</em>. In this case, we are using the course context:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer200" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.04_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4 – The Question bank screen, which includes the option to create a new question&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4 – The Question bank screen, which includes the option to create a new question</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to create a quiz and add questions to it. While completing this process, keep in mind that when you create a question, you are adding that question to Moodle's question bank. In the preceding screenshot, you can see that when you select a category, a course has already been selected (<strong class="bold">20th-C-HUM</strong>). At the same time, you can make sure that your question shows up when you search in the subcategories by checking <strong class="bold">Also show questions from subcategories</strong>.</p>
			<p>It is useful to keep in mind that Moodle 4.0 has built-in functionality boosters for the Moodle Quiz activity. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip </p>
			<p class="callout">There is a new setting that allows you to have your settings automatically saved when you create a Quiz question, and they are applied to the next question. This saves time and allows you to be consistent.  </p>
			<p>The questions in the question bank can be categorized and shared. The real asset in your learning site is not the quizzes, but the question bank that you and your fellow teachers build over time.  </p>
			<p>So, to recap, building<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> the quiz is a three-step process. First, create questions in a question bank. Second, create a quiz. Third, add questions to the quiz. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor725"/>Functionality booster</h2>
			<p>Once you have developed your quiz<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> and you want to deploy it, you can add it to Moodle's Calendar. In Moodle 4.0, you can color-code categories of events and activities and add them directly to the Calendar. For example, you can color-code the quizzes red and the review webinar sessions green so that students can plan their studies more efficiently. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor726"/>Question types</h2>
			<p>The following table explains<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> the types of questions you can create and gives some tips on using them. These question types are included in the default installation<a id="_idIndexMarker578"/> of Moodle. You can obtain plugins from <a href="https://moodle.org">https://moodle.org</a>. These plugins add more question types to your system. This table provides an overview of some of the types of questions that you can use when you are creating a Quiz. Here<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> is a link to the <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> directory: <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:quizaccess">https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:quizaccess</a>. You can also create<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> your own question types (<a href="https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Question_types">https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Question_types</a>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer201" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5 – Selecting the type of question to add</p>
			<p>Take a look at the question <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>types shown in the menu in the preceding screenshot. Now, we will describe each type of question and<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> provide a few tips for using them:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer202" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6 – Types of questions</p>
			<p>Notice that <strong class="bold">Embedded answers (Cloze)</strong> types of questions are in the form of a paragraph with missing text. The missing text blocks are the "embedded answers," which differ from multiple choice in that the paragraph creates an envelope of context, which can help trigger a student's recall and also properly contextualize the material being tested. This type<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> of question is also called a <strong class="bold">Cloze</strong> test or <strong class="bold">Cloze deletion test</strong>. Cloze is a kind of reading comprehension test that involves<a id="_idIndexMarker584"/> asking the person to supply words that have been systematically deleted from a piece of text: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer203" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7 – Embedded answer type of Quiz</p>
			<p>Multiple-choice, short<a id="_idIndexMarker585"/> answer, numerical, and true/false are very popular types of quiz questions. When developing your assessment strategy, try to limit the number of true/false questions because they tend to disproportionately reward students who guess. Short answer questions can be difficult to prepare because the responses must be a perfect match. For that reason, it is often best to use short answer questions that require a numerical response or a vocabulary term:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer204" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8 – Types of questions and when to use them</p>
			<p>Once you've created your quizzes, be<a id="_idIndexMarker586"/> sure to add feedback. Feedback is very important to the learning process because it allows a student who has missed a question to learn the answer, and also to refer back to the text where a lengthy explanation is available. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">On the <strong class="bold">Editing quiz</strong> page, if you have chosen to shuffle answers, check all the multiple-choice questions that you use in the quiz. If any of them have answers such as <strong class="bold">All of the above</strong> or <strong class="bold">Both A and C</strong>, shuffling answers will ruin these questions.</p>
			<p class="callout">Instead, change them to multiple answer questions and give partial credit for each correct answer; for example, instead of <strong class="bold">Both A and C</strong>, you would say <strong class="bold">Select all that apply</strong> and then give partial credit for A and C.</p>
			<p>There should be clear connections between the learning objectives, Bloom's Taxonomy level, and the types of quizzes. The following table will help you match learning objectives, Bloom's Taxonomy level, and quiz type. Bloom's Taxonomy<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> has been widely adopted as a tool for making sure that course assessments align with certain assessment types and learning objectives. They are particularly helpful in the sense that they require the use of verbs with measurable outcomes. It is good to keep in mind that Bloom's Taxonomy is a useful tool:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer205" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.09a_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.9 – Grid to help determine when and where to use types of quizzes&#13;&#10;"/>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9 – Grid to help determine when and where to use types of quizzes</p>
			<p>As you plan your course<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> and your use of quizzes, always consider the learning objectives and also the learning characteristics of your students. Adjust your quiz types as well as their content to accommodate their learning levels as well as prior knowledge. Courses need to be learner-centric. In addition, take into consideration that you may have students with different learning preferences and levels of mobility. Be sure that your quizzes follow Universal Design for Learning concepts and that they can be used to enhance the student experience and self-regulation. </p>
			<h3>Adaptive mode</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Adaptive mode</strong> setting allows multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> attempts <em class="italic">for each question</em>. This is different than <strong class="bold">Attempts allowed</strong>, which allows multiple attempts at <em class="italic">the whole quiz</em>.</p>
			<p>In an adaptive quiz, when a student answers a question incorrectly, the quiz redisplays that question and gives the student another chance to answer it correctly. How many attempts the student gets is determined by how much you penalize the student for each wrong attempt.</p>
			<p>For example, let's assume that you penalize<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> the student 50 percent for a wrong answer. If the student gets a question wrong, they can try once more for half points. If the student gets the second attempt correct, they get half credit. If they get it wrong again, the system subtracts another 50 percent from the score. Now, the question is worth zero points. The system will not redisplay the question for a third attempt, because it's now worth zero points.</p>
			<p>If you penalize the student 33.33 percent for a wrong answer, the student will get three attempts to answer the question. The first attempt is worth 100 percent, the second is worth 66.66 percent, and the third is worth 33.33 percent. There will be no fourth attempt because, after the third wrong answer, the question is worth zero points.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Adaptive mode (no penalties)</strong> setting also gives the student multiple attempts at answering a question. However, the student gets an unlimited number of tries, because there are no penalties for wrong answers.</p>
			<h3>Interactive with multiple tries </h3>
			<p>When you make a quiz interactive<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> with multiple tries, you allow the student to try each question multiple times. After each wrong attempt, Moodle will display a <strong class="bold">Check your answer</strong> message. You can create these messages for each question. For example, if it is a question about the definition of the word "caldera" in an Earth Science course, you can link to a glossary entry if your course includes a glossary and also provide a link to the section in the text that covers that topic.</p>
			<p>This differs from <strong class="bold">Adaptive mode</strong>, where the student gets multiple attempts but no feedback.</p>
			<h3>Immediate feedback</h3>
			<p>When you select <strong class="bold">Immediate feedback</strong>, the student submits each question<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> as they answer it. The quiz immediately displays a message based on the student's answer. You can create separate feedback messages for each answer, any wrong answer, any right answer, and the question, regardless of the answer.</p>
			<p>At this point, let's look at a comparison between the options we've discussed:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer207" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.10_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.10 – Settings for the Adaptive and Interactive modes with multiple tries&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.10 – Settings for the Adaptive and Interactive modes with multiple tries</p>
			<h3>Deferred feedback</h3>
			<p>If a quiz uses <strong class="bold">Deferred feedback</strong>, the student submits the entire<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> quiz after answering all the questions. Then, the quiz displays the student's score and any feedback that you have created for the questions.</p>
			<h3>Each attempt builds on the last</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Each attempt builds on the last</strong> only has an effect if multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> attempts are allowed. When this setting is enabled, each attempt that a student makes will display the results of the student's previous attempt. The student can see how they answered and scored on the previous attempt.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Attempts allowed</strong> option allows the student to keep trying the quiz. <strong class="bold">Each attempt builds on the last</strong> retains the answers from one attempt to another. Taken together, these two settings can be used to create a quiz that the student can keep trying until they get it right. This transforms the quiz from a test into a learning tool. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor727"/>Adding existing questions from the question bank</h2>
			<p>As you saw earlier, you can create<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> a new question and add it to the question bank. You can also add existing questions to a quiz. These questions come from an existing question bank. So, what we are creating is a way to think of the outcomes of your course, develop an assessment strategy, and then create questions to add to the question bank that can be deployed in the most effective ways in course categories, courses, and individual quizzes. </p>
			<p>To add a question from an existing question bank, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>With the named quiz selected, go to <strong class="bold">Quiz</strong> | <strong class="bold">Questions</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the lower right-hand corner, click on <strong class="bold">Add</strong>. A pop-up window is displayed with + <strong class="bold">a new question</strong> | + <strong class="bold">from question bank</strong> | + <strong class="bold">a random question</strong>. Select from question bank.<strong class="bold"> </strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The question bank will be displayed. The questions in the bank are categorized. They can belong to this quiz, to this course, to the category that this course is in, or to the system overall. In the following screenshot, the user is selecting the course's category</p>
			<p>Select the category and question, and then select <strong class="bold">Add selected questions to the qui<a id="_idTextAnchor728"/><a id="_idTextAnchor729"/><a id="_idTextAnchor730"/>z</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor731"/>Configuring quiz settings</h2>
			<p>When you first create<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> a quiz, you need to go to the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page. The settings that you select only affect that particular quiz. The settings affect things such as the number of questions displayed on each page of the quiz, whether a student can retry the quiz, whether the quiz has a time limit, and more. The settings affect the look and behavior of the quiz:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer208" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.11_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.11 – Quiz settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.11 – Quiz settings</p>
			<p>Once you've chosen<a id="_idIndexMarker597"/> your settings, you can add questions to the quiz; the questions are the content of the quiz.</p>
			<p>In Moodle, think of a quiz as a combination of the settings (display and behavior), the container (the quiz pages), and the questions (content).</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page is divided into nine areas. Let's look at the settings under each area,<a id="_idTextAnchor732"/> top to bott<a id="_idTextAnchor733"/>om.</p>
			<h3>General</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">General</strong> settings include the name<a id="_idIndexMarker598"/> and description of the quiz:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer209" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.12_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12 – Quiz name and description in the General settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.12 – Quiz name and description in the General sett<a id="_idTextAnchor734"/>ings</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Name</strong> property of the quiz is displayed on the course's home page, while the <strong class="bold">Description</strong> property is displayed when a student selects the quiz.</p>
			<p>The description should<a id="_idIndexMarker599"/> explain why the student is taking the quiz. It should also inform the student of any unusual features of the quiz, for example, or whether it uses a pop-up window. Remember that once the student clicks on the <strong class="bold">Attempt quiz now</strong> button, they are in the quiz, so give the student everything they need to understand why and how to take the quiz before clicking on the <strong class="bold">Attempt quiz now</strong> button.</p>
			<p>Optionally, you can display the description on the course's home page. If you do this, it<a id="_idTextAnchor735"/> will continue to display when the student selects the q<a id="_idTextAnchor736"/>uiz.</p>
			<h3>Timing</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Open</strong> and <strong class="bold">Close</strong> dates determine when<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> the quiz is available. If you do not select the <strong class="bold">Enable</strong> checkbox for <strong class="bold">Open the quiz</strong>, the quiz will be permanently open, instead of becoming available on a given date. If you do not select the <strong class="bold">Enable</strong> checkbox for <strong class="bold">Close the quiz</strong>, then once the quiz is open, it will stay open permanently instead of becoming unavailable on a given date. Moodle 3.10 includes a built-in timer for students to see and be aware of how much time they have left in a quiz. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Even if the quiz is closed, it will still show on the course's home page, and students may still try to select it. When they select a closed quiz, the students will see a message saying that it is closed.</p>
			<p>If you want to hide a quiz, further down on this page, under <strong class="bold">Common module settings</strong>, you will see the <strong class="bold">Visible</strong> setting; change this setting to <strong class="bold">Hide</strong>.</p>
			<p>By default, a quiz does not have<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> a time limit. If you want to set a time limit, use the <strong class="bold">Time limit</strong> setting. When time runs out, the quiz is automatically submitted with the answers that have been filled out. A time limit can help prevent the use of reference materials while taking the quiz. For example, if you want students to answer the questions quickly from memory with minimal interaction with the course textbook, setting a timer may encourage students to review the material more extensively before taking the quiz.</p>
			<p>When students are taking a timed quiz, they see a countdown timer on the quiz page. With Moodle 4.0, the countdown timer follows the students as they scroll down the questions. </p>
			<p>If you set a time limit for the quiz, in the quiz's description, inform the students about what happens when the time limit is reached. For example, if you configure the quiz to discard the student's answers if the student has not submitted the quiz in time, inform the student about <a id="_idTextAnchor737"/><a id="_idTextAnchor738"/><a id="_idTextAnchor739"/>this. </p>
			<h3>Grade</h3>
			<p>If you allow several attempts, the <strong class="bold">Grading method</strong> option determines<a id="_idIndexMarker602"/> which grade is recorded in the course's grade book: <strong class="bold">Highest</strong>, <strong class="bold">Average</strong>, <strong class="bold">First</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Last</strong>. If you do not allow multiple attempts, then <strong class="bold">Grading method</strong> will have no effect.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Attempts allowed</strong> can be used to limit the number of times a student takes the quiz. Further down the page, you can choose settings that require the student to wait<a id="_idTextAnchor740"/> between attempts. The time delay settings will only take effect if you enable multiple at<a id="_idTextAnchor741"/>tempts.</p>
			<h3>Layout</h3>
			<p>The settings under <strong class="bold">Layout</strong> control<a id="_idIndexMarker603"/> the order of the questions on the quiz and the number of questions that appear on a page.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Question order</strong> determines whether the questions appear in the order that you placed them while editing or randomly. The random order will change each time the quiz is displayed. This does not allow students to share quiz answers and encourages them to focus on the wording when they retake a quiz.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">New page</strong> determines where page breaks will fall. It determines whether you will have a page break after every question, every two questions, and so on:</p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.13 – Configuring the layout for every 6 questions</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">The <strong class="bold">New page</strong> setting determines where Moodle automatically puts the page breaks. While you create the quiz, you can move these page breaks to the page where you edit the questions for the quiz.</p>
			<p>By default, all questions in a quiz are displayed on separate pages. <strong class="bold">New page</strong> breaks up the quiz into smaller pages. Moodle inserts the page breaks for you. On the <strong class="bold">Editing quiz</strong> page, you can move these page breaks. If you want to break up your quiz into pages that hold the same number of questions, this setting will work for you. If you want each page in the quiz to hold a different number of questions, use this setting anyway and edit the page breaks that Moodle creates f<a id="_idTextAnchor742"/>or you.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Navigation method</strong> setting determines whether the student can go back and forth between questions. If this setting is set to <strong class="bold">Sequential</strong>, the student must answer the questions in order. If questions near the end of the test give clues to the answers to questions at the beginning, you may want to change this setting to <strong class="bold">Seque<a id="_idTextAnchor743"/><a id="_idTextAnchor744"/>ntial</strong>. </p>
			<h3>Review options</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Review options</strong> setting determines what<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> information a student can see when they review a quiz. These options also determine when they can see this information. You can see these options in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer211" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.14 – Configuring the Review options screen</p>
			<p>Here is what the different options mean:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.16 – The timing of when response information is revealed</p>
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p>Here, you can customize the appearance<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> of the Quiz activity: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer214" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.17_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.17 – Configuring the appearance of the Quiz&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.17 – Configuring the appearance of the Quiz</p>
			<p>The settings under <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> affect the information that is displayed while the student is taking the quiz.</p>
			<p>If <strong class="bold">Show the user's picture</strong> is set to <strong class="bold">Small image</strong> or <strong class="bold">Large image</strong>, while the student is taking the quiz, the student's picture and name will be displayed in the quiz window. This makes it easier for an exam proctor to confirm that the students have logged in themselves. The proctor can just look over the student's shoulder and see the student's picture and name on the screen.</p>
			<p>The settings for <strong class="bold">Decimal places in grades</strong> and <strong class="bold">Decimal places in question grades</strong> affect the grades that are shown to the student. The first setting affects the display of the overall grade for the quiz, while the second setting affects how the grade is displayed for each question.</p>
			<p>No matter how many decimal places you display, Moodle's database calculates the grades with full accuracy. When you create a course, you can add blocks to the left and right sidebars. The <strong class="bold">Show blocks during quiz attempts</strong> setting determines whether these blocks are displayed while the student<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> is taking the quiz. Normally, this is set to <strong class="bold">No</strong> so that the student is not distracted while taking the quiz.<a id="_idTextAnchor746"/><a id="_idTextAnchor747"/><a id="_idTextAnchor748"/></p>
			<h3>Safe Exam Browser</h3>
			<p>Moodle 4.0 allows you to require the use of <strong class="bold">Safe Exam Browser</strong> (<strong class="bold">SEB</strong>). SEB is a web browser environment<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> that allows you<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> to carry out e-assessments in a secure manner. The software turns any computer into a secure workstation and controls access to resources such as system functions, websites, and applications so that they cannot be used during an exam. Not every institution uses this approach since it is easily circumvented, both by smartphones and written notes and printed publications. You can configure SEB manually, or you can upload your own configuration. An exam configuration, as the name implies, is done for an exam and contains most of the known configuration attributes from the latest SEB configuration tool. It is outside the scope of this book to go into system administrator configurations in detail. If your institution uses SEB, obtain the configuration from your system administrator:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer215" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.18 – Safe Exam Browser configuration</p>
			<h3>Extra restrictions on attempts</h3>
			<p>You may want your students to have<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> additional restrictions<a id="_idIndexMarker611"/> on attempts for the quiz.  Sometimes, it's a good idea to add more restrictions if you want to pace the students and add a level of security: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer216" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.19_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.19 – Configuring Extra restrictions on attempts &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.19 – Configuring Extra restrictions on attempts </p>
			<p>If you enter anything<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> into the <strong class="bold">Require password</strong> field, the student<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> must enter that password to access the quiz.</p>
			<p>With <strong class="bold">Require network address</strong>, you can restrict access to the quiz to particular IP address/addresses. For example, you can restrict the quiz's access to the following IP addresses:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">146.203.59.235</strong>: This is a single IP address. It will permit a single computer to access the quiz. If this computer is acting as a proxy server, the other computers <em class="italic">behind</em> it can also access the quiz.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">146.203</strong>: This is a range of IP addresses. It will permit any IP address starting with those numbers. If those numbers belong to your company, you effectively limit access to the quiz to your company's campus.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">146.203.59.235/20</strong>: This is a subnet. It will permit the computers on that subnet to access the quiz.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Enforced delay</strong> settings prevent students from attempting<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> the quiz without waiting between attempts. If you show the students the correct<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> answers after they submit the quiz, you may want to set a delay between attempts. This prevents students from attempting the quiz, seeing the correct answers, and then immediately trying the quiz again while those answers are fresh in their memory.</p>
			<p>If <strong class="bold">Browser security</strong> is set to <strong class="bold">Full-screen popup…</strong>, the quiz will be launched in a new browser window. It uses JavaScript to disable copying, saving, and printing. This security<a id="_idTextAnchor749"/> is not fool<a id="_idTextAnchor750"/>proof.</p>
			<h4>Techniques for greater se<a id="_idTextAnchor751"/>curity</h4>
			<p>Your organization may require<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> proctoring. There are several ways to build virtual proctoring into Moodle. For example, you can link out to a virtual test-taking<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> proctoring platform such as Meazure Learning (formerly ProctorU – <a href="https://www.meazurelearning.com/">https://www.meazurelearning.com/</a>). You will need a subscription to their service, and all the students will need a built-in camera and microphone. Once you've subscribed, you can create a link so that they can log into the platform from within their course in Moodle. </p>
			<p>You can also devise a solution by asking the students to take the exams and have the camera on them at all times. You can do that by simultaneously asking them to log into Zoom, Teams, or BigBlueButton so that all the individuals in the class will show up on the same screen. </p>
			<p>Here are a few strategies for developing effective proctored exams:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create numerous questions, but have the quiz show only a small set of them; this makes sharing questions less useful.</li>
				<li>Shuffle the questions and answers. This also makes sharing questions more difficult.</li>
				<li>Apply a time limit. This makes using reference material more difficult.</li>
				<li>Open the quiz for only a few hours. Have your students schedule the time to take the quiz. Make yourself available during this time to help with technical issues.</li>
				<li>Place one question on each page of the quiz; this discourages stud<a id="_idTextAnchor752"/>ents from taking screenshots of the enti<a id="_idTextAnchor753"/>re quiz.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Overall feedback</h4>
			<p>Moodle enables<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> you to create several different kinds of feedback for a quiz:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can create feedback<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> for the entire quiz, which changes with the student's score. This is called <strong class="bold">Overall feedback</strong> and uses a<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> feature called <strong class="bold">Grade boundary</strong>:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer217" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.20_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.20 – The Overall feedback configuration screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.20 – The Overall feedback configuration screen</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can create feedback for a question, no matter what the student's score on that question is. All students<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> receive the same feedback. This is called <strong class="bold">General feedback</strong>. Each question can have <strong class="bold">General feedback</strong>. The type of feedback that you can create for a question varies with the type of question.</li>
				<li>You can create feedback for a response. This is the feedback that the student receives when they select that response to <a id="_idTextAnchor754"/>a question.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following screenshot<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> shows <strong class="bold">Overall feedback</strong> with a <strong class="bold">Grade boun<a id="_idTextAnchor755"/><a id="_idTextAnchor756"/>dary</strong> set:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.21 – The Overall feedback details configuration screen</p>
			<h4>Common module settings</h4>
			<p><strong class="bold">Group mode</strong> works in the same way as it does for any other<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> resource. However, since students take the quiz themselves, the only real use for this group setting in a quiz is to display the high score for a group in the <strong class="bold">Quiz Results</strong> block.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Visible</strong> can show and hide the quiz from students. However, a teacher or course creator can still see the quiz. Now that<a id="_idIndexMarker624"/> we've configured the feedback for a quiz, let's look at adding questio<a id="_idTextAnchor757"/><a id="_idTextAnchor758"/><a id="_idTextAnchor759"/>ns to a quiz.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor760"/>Adding questions to a quiz</h1>
			<p>Once you've selected the quiz<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> from your course<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> home page, you can add questions to the question bank that is used when constructing the quiz. First, go to <strong class="bold">Administration </strong>| <strong class="bold">Quiz administration </strong>| <strong class="bold">Edit quiz</strong>. On the <strong class="bold">Editing quiz</strong> page, you can see the <strong class="bold">Add a question...</strong> button:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.22 – Adding questions to a quiz</p>
			<p>Before we look at the detailed instructions to create new questions, let's look at the <strong class="bold">Question bank contents</strong> button. Also, on the <strong class="bold">Quiz administration</strong> menu, you can see <a id="_idTextAnchor761"/>the options for <strong class="bold">Question bank</strong>; these options<a id="_idIndexMarker627"/> enable you to work<a id="_idIndexMarker628"/> with the question bank.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Functionality Booster  </p>
			<p class="callout">An essay is a question type in Moodle. Moodle 4.0 incorporates a word count feature for Essay questions, which allows you to set minimum and maximum word counts for answers. When the minimum word count has not been satisfied, a message will automatically appear and aler<a id="_idTextAnchor762"/>t the learner.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor763"/>Multiple-choice questions in the question bank</h2>
			<p>Multiple-choice quizzes<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> are some of the most widely used types<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> of quizzes in online courses. Given their pervasive presence, it is important to know how to write robust, psychometrically sound multiple-choice questions. Let's review multiple-choice questions to see what they contain and how they're written. Each multiple-choice question consists of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A stem (the question)</li>
				<li>The key (the correct answer)</li>
				<li>Distractors (the incorrect choices)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your stem should be clear and simple. The stem should be as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be phrased as a question</li>
				<li>Have meaning by itself</li>
				<li>Contain only relevant material</li>
				<li>Avoid being negatively stated</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer220" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.23_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.23 – The Adding a Multiple choice question page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.23 – The Adding a Multiple choice question page</p>
			<p>Once you've added<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> the multiple-choice question, you'll need<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> to configure the answers. You have several options, as shown here: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer221" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.24_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.24 – Configuring the structure of the answers&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.24 – Configuring the structure of the answers</p>
			<p>A single idea or concept<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> should form the foundation<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> of the stem, and it should contain verbs that correspond to the correct level of Bloom's taxonomy. The reason why you should shape the stem as a question is because it allows the learner to focus on answering the question. It also has less cognitive load than if you ask the learner to keep a partial sentence in working memory and complete the sentence. </p>
			<p>The answers should have the key (the correct answer) and wrong answers, which are distractors. The distractors should be plausible. In addition, they should be as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be clear and concise</li>
				<li>Not contain clues to the answer</li>
				<li>Not include absolutes such as "always" or "never"</li>
				<li>Not contain overlapping content</li>
				<li>Not include "all of the above" or "none of the above"</li>
				<li>Be presented in a logical order (alphabetical, for example) to avoid the tendency to place it in a preferential answer position</li>
			</ul>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.25 – Configuring the answers</p>
			<p>The distractors<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> should be plausible and not be absurd<a id="_idIndexMarker636"/> or comical (however tempting it is to include them). They should be similar in length. You should also include feedback for each incorrect answer or distractor so that the experience provides a learning opportunity:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor764"/>Guessing games</h2>
			<p>As you develop your quiz, it's useful to know<a id="_idIndexMarker637"/> the kinds of guessing games<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> that students taking multiple-choice quizzes typically employ. Here are a few, along with strategies for countering them: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>"The correct answer is usually second or third."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Solution: Make sure that your answers are random, or in a meaningful order (alphabetical, for example).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"The longest answer is always the correct one."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Solution: Make sure that all the choices are of about the same length. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Pick the most technical-sounding term."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Solution: All choices should be of the same technical level.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Pick the one that has key terms you recognize."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Solution: Include key terms in all of the distractors. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor765"/>Developing quiz questions that align with the higher-order levels of Bloom's Taxonomy</h2>
			<p>Creating questions <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>that correspond to the levels of Bloom's Taxonomy is perhaps the most challenging aspect of developing multiple-choice questions and choices. To create higher-level multiple-choice questions, you must consider three key elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sequential reasoning</li>
				<li>Incorporating high cognitive levels, including application, analysis, and synthesis</li>
				<li>Using a unique or novel but always realistic case, scenario, chart, or graph </li>
			</ul>
			<p>It may interest you to know that if you<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> use a case, scenario, chart, or graph, it is referred to as the "stimulus." You can use it for a cluster of related multiple-choice questions, which may have benefits for you as you look at the course objectives. You can write a cluster of questions based on a single stimulus (case, scenario, chart, or graph). </p>
			<p>Another strategy for employing higher-order cognitive skills is to use a "multiple response, multiple choice" question. In such a question, you can ask learners to "select all that apply" and to receive credit, they must select all the correct answers. The advantages are that you will allow for several correct answers, there is less opportunity for guessing, and it avoids the "all of the above" option. The downside is that it requires 5 or 6 options, and it is more difficult to construct because it contains more distractors. </p>

Retrieved October 13, 2003, from <a href="http://testing.wisc.edu/Handbook%20on%20Test%20Construction.pdf">http://testing.wisc.edu/Handbook%20on%20Test%20Construction.pdf</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor766"/>Matching</h2>
			<p>A matching question<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> consists of two lists of related words, phrases, pictures, or symbols<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> that appear in columns adjacent to each other. Each item corresponds to at least one item in the other list. </p>
			<p>Matching is used to recognize relationships and make associations. It aligns with Bloom's taxonomy's "Remember" level, which requires learners to identify, list, and make connections. They can be used in a wide range of subject matter, and they can be used for terms, definitions, symbols, names, cause and effect, parts with functions, procedures with operations, and principles that apply to situations. </p>
			<p>In Moodle, we can start by configuring the matching options:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer224" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.27_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.27 – Configuring matching options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.27 – Configuring matching options</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>next step would<a id="_idIndexMarker644"/> be to configure the answers. Make sure that you always include feedback so that the student can learn and reinforce the correct responses: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer225" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.28_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.28 – Configuring answers&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.28 – Configuring answers</p>
			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>you have configured<a id="_idIndexMarker646"/> the answers, you can add feedback. Note that the editing menu allows you to embed images, video, audio, and HTML5 content so that your matching questions can incorporate more complex content, such as specific procedures or situations. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Sharing Questions</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want the questions that you create for this quiz to be available to other users of the site, create the questions and then add them to the question bank and the quiz at the same time by selecting the correct contexts. Note that your role determines your ability to manage questions. </p>
			<p>As shown in the <em class="italic">Adding questions to a quiz</em> section, you can create questions and add them directly to a quiz and the question bank at the same time. As shown earlier in the <em class="italic">Adding questions to the question bank</em> section, you can also change the category/contexts for the questions later so that you can use the questions for more than one purpose. If you're in a hurry to create questions for a quiz, select <strong class="bold">Edit quiz</strong> and start creating them. You can rearrange them<a id="_idTextAnchor767"/> in the question bank later.</p>
			<p>You can also display questions<a id="_idIndexMarker647"/> from one category at a time. To select that category, use the <strong class="bold">Category</strong> drop-down list.</p>
			<p>If a question is<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> deleted when it is still being used by a quiz, it is not removed from the question bank; instead, the question is hidden. The <strong class="bold">Also show old questions</strong> setting enables you to see questions that were deleted from the category. These deleted (or hidden or old) questions appear in the list with blue boxes next to them.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">To keep your question bank clean and to prevent teachers from using deleted questions, you can move all the deleted questions<a id="_idIndexMarker649"/> into a category called <strong class="bold">Deleted questions</strong>. Create the <strong class="bold">Deleted questions</strong> category and then use <strong class="bold">Also show old questions</strong> to show the deleted questions. Select these questions and mo<a id="_idTextAnchor768"/><a id="_idTextAnchor769"/>ve them into <strong class="bold">Deleted questions</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Moving questions between categories</h3>
			<p>Every question in the question<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> bank belongs to a category. If a question belongs to a category for the course, only teachers with access to that course can see and reuse the question. If a question belongs to a category for the system, the question can be seen and reused by all teachers in the system. To let your questions be used by other teachers, you may want to move them to a category that <a id="_idTextAnchor770"/>is accessible by other teachers.</p>
			<p>Select the question(s) to move, select the category, and t<a id="_idTextAnchor771"/>hen click on the <strong class="bold">Move to </strong>button.</p>
			<h3>Managing the proliferation of questions and categories</h3>
			<p>As the site administrator, you may<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> want to monitor the creation of new question categories to ensure that they are logically named, don't have a lot of overlap, and are appropriate for your site. As these questi<a id="_idTextAnchor772"/>on categories and the questions in them are shared among course creators, they can be <a id="_idTextAnchor773"/>powerful tools for collaboration.</p>
			<h3>Creating and editing question categories</h3>
			<p>Every question belongs<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> to a category. You can manage<a id="_idIndexMarker653"/> question categories under the <strong class="bold">Categories</strong> tab. There will always be a <strong class="bold">Default</strong> category. However, before you create new questions, you may want to check to ensure that you have an a<a id="_idTextAnchor774"/>ppropriate category to put them in.</p>
			<p>To add a new category, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To add a new question category within a system context, go to <strong class="bold">Course administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Question bank</strong> | <strong class="bold">Categories</strong>.</li>

			<h3>Types of feedback for a question</h3>
			<p>In a multiple-choice question, you <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>can create three kinds of feedback, as described in the following table:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer226" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.29_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.29 – Feedback for multiple-choice questions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor781"/>Figure 7.29 – Feedback for multiple-choice questions</p>
			<p>Remember that these types of feedback are not activated because the student chose a specific response – they are activated because the student chose any correct, partially correct, or incorrect response.</p>
			<p>We will discuss the process of creating feedback<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> for individual responses in the <em class="italic">Feedback fo<a id="_idTextAnchor782"/>r individual responses</em> section<a id="_idTextAnchor783"/>.</p>
			<p>Now, let's learn how to add random questions to a quiz. <a id="_idTextAnchor784"/><a id="_idTextAnchor785"/><a id="_idTextAnchor786"/><a id="_idTextAnchor787"/><a id="_idTextAnchor788"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor789"/>Adding random questions to a quiz</h1>
			<p>You can add several random questions<a id="_idIndexMarker656"/> to your quiz. In the following<a id="_idIndexMarker657"/> screenshot, note that there are three questions in the selected category. The maximum number of questions that can be added depends on the number of questions in the category:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer227" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.30_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.30 – Adding random questions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.30 – Adding random questions</p>
			<p>You can add random questions from several categories to the same quiz.</p>
			<p>In the same attempt, students<a id="_idIndexMarker658"/> will never see the same random question<a id="_idIndexMarker659"/> twice. The questions are reset between attempts, so students can see the same question twice if they attempt the same quiz twice.</p>
			<p>To add a random question(s), follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">With the quiz selected, go to <strong class="bold">Questions</strong>.</li>
				<li>A pop-up window will be displayed; select <strong class="bold">Add random question</strong>.</li>
				<li>A dialog box will be displayed. Select the category that you want to draw the random question(s) from:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer228" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.31_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.31 – Configuring random questions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.31 – Configuring random questions</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Select the number of questions<a id="_idIndexMarker660"/> to add, and then select<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> the <strong class="bold">Add random</strong> <strong class="bold">question</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's look at some other functions available under the <strong class="bold">Questions</strong> <a id="_idTextAnchor790"/><a id="_idTextAnchor791"/><a id="_idTextAnchor792"/>tab.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor793"/>Maximum grade</h2>
			<p>The quiz's maximum grade<a id="_idIndexMarker662"/> is the quiz's point contribution toward the course. In this example, the quiz is worth 10 points toward the student's total for the course.</p>
			<p>The grade for each question will be scaled to the quiz's maximum grade. For example, if this quiz had two questions worth <strong class="bold">1</strong> point each but <strong class="bold">Maximum grade</strong> is <strong class="bold">10</strong>, each qu<a id="_idTextAnchor794"/>estion will contribute <strong class="bold">5</strong> points to the student's total grade for the co<a id="_idTextAnchor795"/>urse.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor796"/>The grade for each question</h2>
			<p>Each question has a point<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> value, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer229" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.32_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 7.32 – Adding the point values to the quiz&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.32 – Adding the point values to the quiz</p>
			<p>The question's point value is scaled to the quiz's <strong class="bold">Maximum grade</strong>. For example, if a question has a grade of <strong class="bold">2</strong> and the quiz has a maximum value of <strong class="bold">10</strong>, that question is worth one-fifth of the quiz's <a id="_idTextAnchor797"/><a id="_idTextAnchor798"/><a id="_idTextAnchor799"/>grade.</p>
			<p>Now that we have set up quizzes, let's learn how to use them in conjunction with mastery learn<a id="_idTextAnchor800"/><a id="_idTextAnchor801"/><a id="_idTextAnchor802"/><a id="_idTextAnchor803"/><a id="_idTextAnchor804"/>ing. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor805"/>Mastery learning</h1>
			<p>Many organizations require<a id="_idIndexMarker664"/> learners to show that they have achieved mastery, which means they have achieved the minimum passing score (usually 80 percent) in knowledge and skills associated with the course outcomes. This is particularly important in the case of training and regulatory compliance.</p>
			<p>Moodle allows you to develop a question bank that is specific to the statutes, standards, or codes for regulatory compliance. Be sure to plan the sequence (storyboard) and also to provide responses that refer to the correct answers in the text. The following steps are important to follow when you're applying<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> mastery learning:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Clearly state the grade or score that must be earned.</li>
				<li>Allow students to repeat the questions or the quiz if they failed until the qualifying score or grade is earned.</li>
				<li>Incorporate the regulations as a link, file, or embedded player.</li>
				<li>Provide explanations for incorrect answers and point them to the passages that provide the correct responses.</li>
				<li>Categorize and classify the questions according to the nomenclature used in the codes.</li>
				<li>Ensure that the form of the questions is similar to that used in the test, which they will be required to take if there are further exams or skills demonstrations that must be performed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After demonstrating mastery, it is time to incorporate them into a larger set of assessments, which we refer to as "competency frameworks." They are vital for establishing specific types of learning outcomes, particularly when they relate to a specific type of skill or job-related compe<a id="_idTextAnchor806"/><a id="_idTextAnchor807"/><a id="_idTextAnchor808"/>tency. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor809"/>Quizzes and competency frameworks</h2>
			<p>Moodle allows you to tie to competency frameworks, which are external performance standards. For example, if your organization has an overall rubric that lists types<a id="_idIndexMarker666"/> of competencies, you may classify your questions so that they align with the competency categories. Then, when the student correctly performs the tasks in the quiz, a positive score is received, and a box is checked in the competency framework.</p>
			<p>It is possible to automate this process so that the competency framework is automatically updated for the student. However, it is easier to simply code the questions so that they reflect the competency categories and to independently calculate a score for the competency framework.</p>
			<p>Quiz questions can tie to the competency frameworks you may be using. Alter<a id="_idTextAnchor810"/>natively, entire quizzes can tie to them and incorporate a single aspect of the framework: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer230" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.33 – Adding compe<a id="_idTextAnchor811"/>tencies</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor812"/>Certificates</h2>
			<p>Certificates<a id="_idIndexMarker667"/> are important for talent management functions (universities, associations, and individual record-keeping). Certificates can be digital, and they can be printable. Moodle 4.0 has several plugins for certificates that you can import. Certificates can be generated upon successfully completing<a id="_idIndexMarker668"/> a quiz or a series of <a id="_idTextAnchor813"/>quizzes. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor814"/>Badges</h2>
			<p>Badges are earned when a student demonstrates successful completion<a id="_idIndexMarker669"/> of a course, which can also relate to mastery learning. Because mastery learning is often tied to completing quizzes, it often follows that to earn a badge, the student will need to successfully complete quizzes. An <strong class="bold">Open Badge</strong> is a verifiable, portable digital badge with embedded metadata about skills and achievements. It complies with the Open Badges standard and can be shared via social media across the web. Each Open Badge is associated with an image and information about the badge, the organization that issued it, the subject matter, and other key evidence (number and so on). </p>
			<p>Badges are similar to certificates, but they can also be displayed on social media, which makes them ideal for promoting and publicizing courses and programs. Badges are earned upon successfully completing a quiz or series of quizzes. Certificates can be specifically tied to an organization or board, while badges are more informal and are intended to be displayed on social media. </p>
			<p>Moodle's Badge plugin allows you to design a badge and also make it portable so that it can be displayed on social media. Instead of having to upload them to all your social media sites, it's possible<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> to utilize the Open Badges project (<a href="https://openbadges.org">https://openbadges.org</a>) and include the social media in the Open Badges Backpack, which is provided by Mozilla's Badgr. Badgr Backpack is an app that helps you organize and share your badges from<a id="_idIndexMarker671"/> a single place (Badgr | Achieve Anything, Recognize Everything, <a href="https://info.badgr.com/">https://info.badgr.com/</a>).</p>
			<p>Incorporating badges is easier<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> than ever since Moodle 3.11 supports Open Badges v2.1 (Open Badges Version 2.1 ) | IMS Global Learning Consortium,  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v2p1/">https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v2p1/</a>).</p>
			<p>You can set your quizzes so that they automatically generate badges when the student achieves a qualifying score. Badges can indicate course completion, as well as certifications:</p>

			<p>Being able to successfully complete assessments to demonstrate mastery of a topic or course is critical. Being able to generate badges and certificates will allow you to meet your learners' need to demonstrate that they have achieved a certain skill level or knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker675"/> for a specific course, s<a id="_idTextAnchor815"/>kill, or job. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor816"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Moodle's Quiz activity is flexible and can be used in several settings to assess students, particularly those in the lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy. That said, Moodle 4.0 is designed to make learning in many settings and with numerous devices and delivery methods possible, and the Quiz activity is often the most expedient method for assuring the attainment of learning objectives. That said, it is very important to know how to write psychometrically sound multiple-choice questions. </p>
			<p>One aspect of the Quiz activity in Moodle 4.0 is that it is rich in feedback. The different types of feedback enable you to turn a quiz into a learning activity. Consider using the Quiz activity not just for testing but also for teaching. It can also be used for demonstrating competency, mastery of learning, and compliance. Accomplishments can be recorded and displayed automatically using plugins such as certificates and badges.</p>
			<p>The site administrator and teachers should work together to organize questions in the question bank and give teachers access to the categories of questions they need.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you'll learn how to make a course more social with forums and chats.</p>
