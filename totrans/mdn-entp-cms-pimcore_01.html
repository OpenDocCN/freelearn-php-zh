			<p>If you bought this book, you probably already have a rough idea of what Pimcore is. <strong class="bold">Pimcore</strong> is an open source, enterprise-grade <strong class="bold">Digital eXperience Platform </strong>(<strong class="bold">DXP</strong>) solution that aims to be the leader in its market segment. But what does this definition really mean? It sounds very vague as, too often in the IT world, buzzwords are used as filler when describing something. And that's why we have to explain what Pimcore is properly, not just telling you what it does but drilling down into the problems it solves.</p>
			<p>Understanding the scenarios where the tools we are going to study will be employed is always an excellent way to proceed, especially when you want to learn Pimcore, a platform that will revolutionize your development experience.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will explore the Pimcore platform, learning about the benefits and opportunities it offers and how it differs from other solutions. </p>
			<p>The chapter is organized as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why do you need more than a simple CMS?</li>
				<li>What is Pimcore?</li>
				<li>Discovering Pimcore's features</li>
				<li>Learning about Pimcore's benefits</li>
				<li>Learning about the benefits of using open source software</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Why do you need more than a simple CMS?</h1>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> section, we will learn about how the <strong class="bold">Content Management System</strong> (<strong class="bold">CMS</strong>) has evolved in recent years and what new requirements these changes have brought up. Understanding market trends and needs is fundamental to successfully adopting a CMS platform that will support our business or our customers' business for years to come. Learning about a tool such as Pimcore without fully understanding how it can be useful could be a waste of time, and you may lose a lot of technical opportunities that could solve your or your customers' problems. </p>
			<p>So, let's introduce the problem that Pimcore solves. Then, it will be very easy to understand why Pimcore created this product in the way that it did and why we should adopt it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Understanding the change in requirements</h2>
			<p>The first thing to<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> accept is that there has been an evolution in the market. We are no longer satisfied with a tool that only builds a website. That was okay 10 years ago, but now, most companies have a more holistic approach to digital communication and want more. You don't have to be scared by this change; since the birth of the internet, we've seen many evolutions and things have become better and better. We simply have to follow the trends, or better, anticipate the trends.</p>
			<p>Think of what has happened in the last 20 years. We started with the internet just producing static text content. It literally meant manually writing every single page and uploading it<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> using a <strong class="bold">File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTP</strong>) link, if you were lucky. We still remember when we were fighting with scripting languages to mix HTML, data, and Flash content just to render two or three pages for a simple website. </p>
			<p>CMS was a very big leap forward. Managing dynamic content from the browser unlocked the opportunity of letting the final user manage their data, reducing the development effort required. That was a revolution, and many CMS solutions spread across the web. WordPress, Drupal, and other products became a must for creating websites. They were (and probably still are) good solutions for most scenarios, but we are here to enhance our tool range and be ready for what the market will ask of us tomorrow.</p>
			<p>Now it's time to push the user experience to the next level, and we need a good tool to support this digital evolution.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>What is a DXP?</h2>
			<p>The main<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> topic to learn about to understand the market's current needs in terms of digital innovation is <strong class="bold">DXP</strong>. This acronym was coined by Gartner and is a way to describe a technical solution that can support the digital experience of a company. What a company should do, nowadays, is put the customer at the center of everything and use technology to power the delivery of the right content to the right person. Most of the companies that wanted to expand their business online started their digital transformations years ago. They created e-commerce sites to sell online and reached all their customers with the right products. They have had websites since the beginning of the internet (some have had more than one). Corporations can have a single global website, one per brand, or different websites based on the target market. They also have a portal, to give agents or third-party vendors <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>access <strong class="bold">Business-to-Business</strong> (<strong class="bold">B2B</strong>) information. </p>
			<p>All this segmentation is a nightmare: we have too many platforms, we have to keep them communicating with each other, we have to manage content in different GUIs, and we need multiple logins to do all this. This solution is not optimal, so warrants change. </p>
			<p>But there is a more important reason for this change – we forgot the most important element in all of this: we missed the customer. While grappling with technologies and their evolution, we lost our focus on the thing that's most crucial. That's why we need a unique software solution to effectively manage all those problems we just described: that solution is the Digital eXperience Platform.</p>
			<p>In the following figure, we can see how a DXP includes e-commerce, websites, and portals to create a unique experience:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer005" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17073_01_01.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1: DXP diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1: DXP diagram</p>
			<p>As you can see<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> in the preceding figure, the e-commerce and portal solutions have some things in common; for example, they share the same authentication system. We can also see that websites and portals create web content using the same CMS. Based on your experience, you may already understand that these three solutions need to share some features. Replicating them in separate platforms is redundant, but putting all the elements together in a single platform helps us to reduce complexity and avoid the duplication of data. </p>
			<p>In simple terms, we are talking about having an integrated software framework that can implement a solution to all digital companies' needs. This will lead to engaging a broad set of users through all digital touchpoints. </p>
			<p>Pimcore is that framework. The mission of Pimcore is to make technology an enabler for digital transformation and not an obstacle. The vision of Pimcore is very clear: using only one tool, we should be able to integrate all the other tools in the company and accelerate all processes.</p>
			<p>Most companies have trouble finding data, or they have duplicated data across their system. This usually happens because, historically, these companies adopted many vertical solutions, and only later did they ask themselves how to integrate them. These isolated sets of data<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> are called <strong class="bold">silos</strong>. A quick way to break down data silos is to create a central database with all the information that's needed and to facilitate delivery to the<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> consumer through easy and transparent API protocols. This solution is called <strong class="bold">Master Data Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">MDM</strong>), and it's one of the features offered by Pimcore (we'll see this in <a href="B17073_06_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Digital Asset Management</em>.</p>
			<p>We always need <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>to have central information, but often, this need becomes a pain point when we have to deal with product data. We might sell products across many channels, we might need to print information on them in physical catalogs, and we cannot have different information in different places about<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> the same thing. The centralization of product management is called <strong class="bold">Product Information Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">PIM</strong>), and it is another feature of Pimcore. We will learn more about this later, but for now, keep in mind that growing companies have such needs.</p>
			<p>Finally, we may want to centrally manage digital assets, such as videos, images, and other files. A <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>system that collects and delivers digital assets is called a <strong class="bold">Digital Asset Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAM</strong>) system, and you have probably already guessed that Pimcore also covers this. We will learn more about this topic in the next section.</p>
			<p>The Pimcore platform is the right tool for any company facing a digital experience transformation. Moreover, the digital experience transformation is not the only problem that such a company will face. That's why Pimcore is more than a PIM, CMS, MDM, and DAM put together. Pimcore is a solution to help us realize big changes in the digital experience of our customers.</p>
			<p>In this section, you learned about the challenges that the most important companies are facing. Our duty, as technicians or consultants, is to help companies to look at their simple websites, come up with a more holistic vision of their digital communication, and support their needs with the right technical solution. In the next section, we will learn about what <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>Pimcore is and why it is the right solution to this problem.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>What is Pimcore?</h1>
			<p>When defining <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>what Pimcore is, the first thing to take into account is the name itself. The name suggests that the PIM is the main part, but you shouldn't be taken in by appearances. Pimcore is a lot more than a PIM product.</p>
			<p>We can describe Pimcore as a framework because it gives us all the tools we need to implement our projects. This second definition is not much more intuitive to understand than the first, but it gives us an important hint. Pimcore is a set of tools, but we cannot think of it as a library or some snippets. Pimcore is a set of collaborative tools; each tool can solve its own problem. It is not a product but a suite of products. The combination of all of them helps to design a complete digital solution. In this sense, Pimcore is a true DXP: a platform that enables developers to implement digital projects. This definition is a little bit vague, but it tells us that Pimcore gives us a very wide range of opportunities. We cannot merely say "Pimcore does this or that" because Pimcore can do everything.</p>
			<p>Pimcore is a Swiss Army knife that allows developers to create any software solution. We have been talking about websites here, but Pimcore has other applications, such as delivering digital assets to a company or being the central database for all of a company's information. Pimcore offers many features out of the box, such as DAM, PIM, MDM, and <strong class="bold">Datahub</strong>, in a<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> single package. We have already had a brief overview of what DAM, PIM, and MDM are, but there will be time to go deeper into these topics, including Datahub, in the coming chapters. So, don't worry if these definitions still seem high-level.</p>
			<p>The important thing to know right now is that Pimcore lets you manage most data-related applications without writing a single line of code, as well as providing an out-of-the-box solid e-commerce framework. </p>
			<p>This is the point where you should ask whether all that power is actually required. Do you really need the overhead of managing a complex platform like Pimcore to build your simple website? There are much easier solutions on the market for implementing a website. You can find a super-cheap CMS hosting provider, or use a site builder. These solutions are probably good for small companies, but not for medium to large organizations. Enterprises need to do more, and in this first chapter, you will learn about the opportunities you would be missing by using a simple CMS solution to implement your website.</p>
			<p>If you are reading this book, you are looking for a CMS solution that is able to manage all scenarios, from the simplest to the most complex. And you don't want to implement 10 different tools to satisfy all the needs of your marketing department. Moreover, you do not want to pay for the cost of continuous re-platforming as your business grows. The technical solution for building an application must be a boost, something that gives you more benefits than doing things from scratch, but also something that doesn't limit constant change. You need the option of customizing each part of a website without compromises such as adding thousands of plugins and slowly but steadily losing control of the solution. </p>
			<p>You may still think that Pimcore is a platform with a lot of features that you don't really need – that's understandable. Having a super-powered platform just to realize a simple website may seem like overkill. Sometimes it can be scary. Anyway, if you read the first section of this chapter<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> again, you will agree that, sooner or later, you will need something more than a simple CMS and at that point, you will want to be able to scale without having to change your platform.</p>
			<p>In the following sections, we will learn about the most relevant Pimcore characteristics. This will help you to understand why Pimcore can support your development in all scenarios, from a simple website to a complex corporate portal. Such characteristics include the<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Decoupling data from the UI</li>
				<li>Rendering content properly</li>
				<li>Being ready for the cloud</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look at these.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Decoupling data from the UI</h2>
			<p>The first <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>characteristic of a modern CMS is the separation of <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>the presentation layer from the data structure. Put simply, you<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> have to add data on one side and then draw it from the other, without there being any dependency between the two layers. </p>
			<p>With Pimcore, we have two options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implement a fully decoupled<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> solution (<strong class="bold">Decoupled CMS</strong>).</li>
				<li>Implement<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> a <strong class="bold">headless CMS</strong> solution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the detached model, the separation between the business logic and the presentation layer can be achieved by detaching the data generated from the rendering process. In Pimcore, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>a <strong class="bold">Model View Controller</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVC</strong>) model where the <strong class="bold">Twig</strong> templating engine cannot elaborate on business logic. For anyone who is not an expert on MVC and Twig, MVC is a pattern for separating business logic (controller) from presentation (view) and data (model), while Twig is a PHP template engine.</p>
			<p>The other option is to adopt a fully headless solution. In this case, we expose data using APIs and then render it with a <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>modern <strong class="bold">Single-Page Application</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPA</strong>), such as a React website made static with Gatsby. This headless solution gives a strong separation between the various aspects (such as data definition and data presentation), and data exposed to the app can be used by other applications too. </p>
			<p>The market offers many headless CMS solutions, but Pimcore comes out of the box with both solutions, headless and detached. So, you can manage simple websites using a standard detached approach, and this lets you create templates as usual, but without any mutual<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> dependency between presentation and business logic. This<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> keeps the design simple, and you will benefit from the <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>advantages of decoupling, so you can refresh your website with little effort just by reimplementing the template.</p>
			<p>Anyway, if you want to create an edge solution, you can do so with Pimcore. In fact, it comes with an out-of-the-box solution for exposing data in GraphQL format, and this is enough to transform it into a headless content provider. For those unfamiliar with it, GraphQL is a query language for APIs that describes data and reduces friction between the data producers and consumers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Unifying the user experience</h2>
			<p>At the <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>beginning of the CMS age, there was a division between interactive websites (also known<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> as <strong class="bold">web portals</strong>) and institutional websites. That led to a division between CMS websites and portal solutions. As these CMS websites and portals had different needs, we became used to adopting different tools and maybe different teams of suppliers for each. </p>
			<p>For example, in the past, creating a public website was quite simple, so having a simple CMS solution was okay. On the other hand, creating a portal was more complex, so we needed a highly customizable solution. But with the spread of digital technology, more and more companies started selling online, adding this new requirement. So, what was the solution? The companies simply took a tool from the market, installed it, and started to sell. This was a quick way to solve the problem of selling online, but it caused an issue: it added a third platform (e-commerce) to the CMS and portal. This often meant a new supplier, a new graphic interface, and a different user experience. In other words, it meant a situation where three systems were in different realms in terms of data and user experience. After a few years of fighting with data flows, integrations, and the replication of business logic across these environments, one day, advisors such as Gartner came up with a solution. They told us we had silos in our organization, that silos were bad, and that we should remove them. Moreover, the same advisors told us that commerce, portals, and content management are not different needs, but are all part of the same digital experience. The question is: if all those components are what the user wants, who can provide us with a tool to deliver them? </p>
			<p>Pimcore does<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> things differently from competitors. Its CMS engine manages public and private websites, so you can create reserved areas and portals as well as simple one-page company websites. Moreover, this solution keeps a link to the enterprise, adding some important components that help integration with all other pillars. This special configuration makes Pimcore an ideal platform for unifying the user experience by including in a single platform all the features you need to engage the user.</p>
			<p>So, you can expand a website's functionality until you have encompassed the whole company, e-commerce included. In other words, you can adopt one tool and satisfy most of your digital needs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Readying your company for the cloud</h2>
			<p>The ancient<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> times when we bought physical servers are forgotten. We are now in the cloud age, and we want to take advantage of all the opportunities that this new world offers. However, we live in a complex world where, for many reasons, the cloud is not always an option. We may have to deal with sensitive data that has to be kept secure in a private data center, or our budget may only allow a cheap hosting provider. Each company has different requirements, but they all need to have a website. Having data on the cloud or on-premises shouldn't be a reason to adopt a digital platform. It has to support both of them natively. </p>
			<p>As a developer, you don't want to serve different client targets with different tools. This would lead you to have to learn many different tools and use them at the same time; that's always hard if you want to maintain a deep specialization in one technology.</p>
			<p>To use different products to serve different segments of the market, you will probably need different technologies and be a double-specialist. For human developers that work for a finite time each day, using too many technologies means having less specialization. The more technology you use, the less time you have to learn it well. We could find a few exceptions to this, but generally speaking, that's how it is. </p>
			<p>Pimcore is different. It can serve everything from the simplest website to the most complex corporate one, thanks to its flexibility and its open source code, which delivers a complete solution for free. This agility is also reflected in its hosting aspects. Pimcore can be deployed as a simple PHP application just by uploading files via FTP to a cheap hosting service or a regular virtual machine, and it supports containerization natively. </p>
			<p>In other words, as a<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> container, Pimcore can be deployed on most <strong class="bold">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) solutions, Docker, or Kubernetes, in the cloud or on-premises. So, the cloud is an opportunity, but not a requirement. You can deploy Pimcore to the cloud, implementing a <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>solution that scales and stands up without human effort for monitoring and maintenance. If you feel confident with a different solution, or you simply don't need to scale, an easier solution is still an option with Pimcore.</p>
			<p>Learning what Pimcore is is essential to understanding its capabilities and following along with the coming chapters. In fact, in the next section, we will start a deep dive into Pimcore's features, which would have been impossible without having discovered what Pimcore is already.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Discovering Pimcore's features</h1>
			<p>As we said earlier<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> in this chapter, Pimcore comes out of the box with some huge features that make it the ideal platform for implementing simple and complex projects.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will present the main features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data management</li>
				<li>CMS and DXP</li>
				<li>PIM</li>
				<li>MDM</li>
				<li>DAM </li>
				<li>E-commerce</li>
				<li>Customer Data Platform (CDP)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look at each one.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Data management</h2>
			<p>Data <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>management is the root of all features in Pimcore. The<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> data management feature aggregates any kind of data and distributes it across multiple channels. Compared to other solutions, Pimcore has the best data management system. It allows you to define data using the UI, and this is very good because you don't have to write a single line of code. You can stop messing about with database tables, field lengths, and data queries; all you need to do is simply open your browser, create your entities, and pick the fields you want. This feature is very similar to what can be found on low-code platforms or headless CMS, but with a boost. </p>
			<p>Most data management tools have, as their unique goal, the data model definition. Such a solution gives us the ability to quickly define a data model and APIs but produces a UI that's hard to use for the regular user. Basically, you are very much limited to the standard data entry interface, so in most cases, you have to write a user UI from scratch. This is what the purely headless principle aims for: delegating all the rendering aspects outside the system. This is a good principle when designing an application for the final user (such as customers or portal users), but what if we need to allow an administrator or editor to enter content on our platform? For such internal users, Pimcore offers an administrative interface that can be customized when you define the data model. </p>
			<p>In other words, when you add a field to a collection of items, such as when adding an SKU field for a product entity, you don't just define how the data is stored (uniqueness, field length, type of date, and so on) but also how this field will be presented to the user. For example, you can group fields in tabs or panels, or simply reorder them to create a good user experience for back-office users, without touching a single line of code. Moreover, Pimcore supports multi-language, so you can select which field is translated just by modeling the fields. This feature transforms Pimcore into the perfect headless CMS because it combines the flexibility of an admin backend that's ready to go with the power of a data API for building custom applications.</p>
			<p>The first time that back-office users see the admin interface, many might feel a little bit lost, what with<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> the thousands of features that the Pimcore <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>admin interface offers. Just after a few minutes of playing with Pimcore, it will be clear what level of freedom you can reach with this tool. Thanks to the multi-tab environment, you can open multiple data tabs in the same window, easily cut and paste data from one place to another, and import\export data in seconds.</p>
			<p>If this doesn't shock you, what we will tell you next will. All that data is made available by REST APIs; this is a native feature that doesn't require any development effort. This means that each one of the entities you model with the Pimcore interface is available through a REST API without any additional effort (since PimcoreX this feature will be available only as an Enterprise Subscription feature). You can make an HTTP call to put a row into a database or query a list of entities without writing a single line of code.</p>
			<p>If you are still not shocked, we can mention the DataHub module again – you can turn on and expose your data to an external system, using the GraphQL standard for API modeling.</p>
			<p>It's easy to see that, when you have the data layer managed, everything else that comes later will be easier.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>CMS and DXP</h2>
			<p>Pimcore<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> is <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>defined on its website<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> as "The Most Adaptive DXP Platform." Ask any <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>developer working with Pimcore and they will confirm that you can probably do everything with it. Using this CMS, you can – other than realizing cool web pages – deliver a personalized digital experience to every customer at every touchpoint. Thanks to its CMS engine, Pimcore enables companies to implement their digital strategy effectively and spend more time and money on what really matters. </p>
			<p>From a developer's point of view, Pimcore's DXP is an integrated framework for implementing any type of digital solution, be it a website or a portal. Moreover, it combines all the tools for implementing e-commerce, and you can turn your website or portal into a complete DXP solution. It's an API-driven approach to make a platform integrable with every system, and it helps to break down silos.</p>
			<p>From the user's point<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> of view, Pimcore is a natural extension of their creativity. The rich <strong class="bold">What You See Is What You Get</strong> (<strong class="bold">WYSIWYG</strong>) interface shows content as it will appear when published. So, you can enter data and build pages without any doubt about what the final result will be. Furthermore, you can create page templates that will drive the user through an assisted page composition. This process asks the editor to write only the content that is relevant, without wasting time changing styles or text positioning.</p>
			<p>The component model lets you use a ton of widgets, all ready to be placed on the page and fully configurable. These widgets are called bricks and – as the name suggests – they build the web page. With the powerful template engine, you can render entities, such as articles or products, or you can define a custom template to be used to build non-standard pages from scratch.</p>
			<p>What else is there to say? Using the integrated tools, you can preview the website while editing, and with the publishing workflow, you can save without the fear of breaking anything.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>PIM</h2>
			<p>Thanks to<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> its<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> powerful data engine, Pimcore manages any type and any amount of data. What if you model a collection of items called "product" and you add a price inside the data model? Well, this makes Pimcore a PIM. This is not a joke. That is how simple working with Pimcore is. You can add a PIM to your company using your browser within a few minutes. After this 5-minute task, you have a unique database for all the products of your company. Thanks to the data integration capabilities of Pimcore, you can ingest data from any CSV files without writing any lines of code, or in any case, with very little effort. Job done. </p>
			<p>Any other system in the company can integrate with you, and the marketing team will manage all products in unique central administration. Here they will define what products go in which channel, what languages are enabled for which market, and so on. So, even in this case, Pimcore gives us simplicity and a complete solution. </p>
			<p>If we haven't convinced you yet, we could tell you about workflows. When you have approval processes or some business logic to add to product management, you can model that using Pimcore <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>workflows. In the next figure, we have an architectural diagram that <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>explains a PIM in action:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer006" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17073_01_02.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2: PIM architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2: PIM architecture</p>
			<p>The preceding figure shows how Pimcore, acting as a PIM, is the single source of truth for products, delivering to many consumers, such as B2B e-commerce, B2C e-commerce, Amazon or eBay marketplaces, or a simple printed catalog. As you can see in the diagram, thanks to the data integration layer, the Pimcore solution can be linked to an existing platform<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> such as <strong class="bold">Enterprise Resource Planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ERP</strong>). </p>
			<p>PIM is a feature that you cannot miss from modern companies, and it is needed for scaling with multiple user touchpoints without duplicating information. It lets you keep control of product data and speed up your software integration. Also, in this case, Pimcore enables <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>you to do this without any headaches, because this is a native feature that comes ready<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> to be activated.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>MDM</h2>
			<p>All that <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>we <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>have told you about PIM is cool, but it has one big limitation: it is related to products only. In fact, looking at your company's needs, you will discover that many other kinds of data need to be shared across the company and managed centrally. Orders, customers, and probably tons of other data are used from all sorts of applications by a company, and each time a project starts, you have to know where data is. But the problem is not related only to these few entities. </p>
			<p>Using Pimcore, we can make information unique and central for all the golden records (information that is central for a company). This ability is out of the box, free, and with limited effort. How? Just by defining the data model and integrating it with the data masters, such as the CRM, ERP, or whatever owns the entity you want to move. Then, you can define an access policy for data, implementing all the logic you want. This is not just cool...it is super cool! With one tool and a few minutes, you can be ready to expose important data to all the company applications you need. Such a solution enables you to dominate your data (this mission is often called data governance). </p>
			<p>This whole configuration is what we called MDM in the first section of this chapter. The main benefits of Pimcore's MDM are that it can manage the structure, but also the validation, versioning, and enrichment of elements. In fact, most entities have different attributes based on their destination. To explain what the benefits of MDM are, we could use any entity, but we will talk again about products. This is just because it is the most common scenario and we can understand it best. When reading the next paragraph, you can replace the word "product" with any other kind of data without changing the meaning (orders, customers, invoices, and so on). </p>
			<p>Think about a product. Where did it start? This is a hard question, because we usually have an R&amp;D team that works on a prototype, then somebody else approves it for market, and then we start selling it. Probably, in this flow, the first stage where we can talk about a concrete product is when the record enters the ERP, creating a product code. The product is owned by the ERP that manages product codes and prices. At this stage, you don't really need a lot more data. You have all that you need to produce a quote or an invoice. Furthermore, most technical solutions are not built to manage cool product information with multiple images and long descriptions. An ERP is a vertical solution and it does very well only with the set of things that are in its scope. It makes no sense to try to push it to do something different. </p>
			<p>Well, what you need here is a data enrichment process. What normally happens, without a PIM or MDM, is that each user enhances data for what they need. So, you can have e-commerce that <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>adds bigger images and long HTML descriptions, but that e-commerce provides <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>information<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> only for products sold in the <strong class="bold">Business to Consumer</strong> (<strong class="bold">B2C</strong>) channel. So, you have to do the same in the B2B portal for other products. That's why, in this example, a product is not managed centrally. Using Pimcore, products and any other entities can be translated and enriched with images, video, and attachments before being delivered to the consumer. This is the only way to dominate data and be able to put the bulk of your effort into the things that really matter to the company, such as implementing good applications instead of fighting with data.</p>
			<p>In the following diagram, we see an architectural diagram of Pimcore acting as an MDM platform:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3: MDM architecture</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>preceding figure, you can see how Pimcore can integrate with<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> many data owners (<strong class="bold">ERP</strong>, <strong class="bold">e-commerce</strong>, <strong class="bold">CRM</strong>). This step collects data through the data integration layer and makes it available to all of a company's applications (<strong class="bold">Marketplace</strong>, <strong class="bold">Catalog</strong>, <strong class="bold">B2B</strong> and <strong class="bold">B2C</strong> applications, or <strong class="bold">Third-party</strong> apps). Using an API gateway, which is a tool for exposing APIs in a safe way, we can also share APIs with suppliers or third-party applications. </p>
			<p>MDM is one pillar of digital innovation. Without it, spreading data across an organization is a messy affair. Using Pimcore, you can manage data centrally, saving the time it would take to implement a custom solution or the money you would spend on expensive tools.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>DAM</h2>
			<p>After having <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>talked <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>about products and data, it's clear that each company has to keep data in a single place, with a unique data model definition, and that they need to make sure that each consumer only receives and reads the information that they need. When talking about products and data here, we are talking about intangible data – not files, or images, or videos, or data that can be downloaded or sent in an attachment, but pure information.</p>
			<p>Tangible data, such as files, videos, and images, are still important resources for a company. In a world where communication is becoming ever more digital, the digital asset is crucial, especially when you have to communicate the same piece of information through multiple channels.</p>
			<p>You have probably guessed the solution to this: we can collect all this information inside Pimcore and then distribute it across the system. It is a very easy solution when you have it already up and running, but it provides a big leap forward for your company.</p>
			<p>This solution is implemented by Pimcore. Pimcore's DAM software is a lot more than just a digital asset management application: it is a true digital transformation enabler. It is a consolidated digital media repository that provides a solid database of reusable digital assets and optimizes data dissemination and content search processes.</p>
			<p>In the next diagram, we see Pimcore acting as DAM:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17073_01_04.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4: DAM architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4: DAM architecture</p>
			<p>In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>figure, Pimcore is the central point where all digital<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> assets are stored. It delivers content to any consumer application that needs them.</p>
			<p>Together with MDM and PIM, DAM is a must-have service in modern enterprises. It enables the distribution of media assets across the company. Here also, Pimcore is a powerful low-cost solution.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Digital commerce</h2>
			<p>Well, we<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> understand that Pimcore is a very powerful platform for managing data and digital content in general and that it includes great CMS support. Now we need to discuss the e-commerce module. </p>
			<p>In fact, a DXP needs this to embrace the full meaning of DXP: the fusion of portals, websites, and e-commerce. E-commerce nowadays is a huge market, and you are probably wondering why this feature was added to Pimcore.</p>
			<p>Just think about what an e-commerce solution entails. The first element to talk about is the budget. Not all e-commerce systems are like Amazon or eBay, so we need to find the right solution based on what we need, but also on how much we can pay. Developers that were active when the e-commerce market started came from an on-premises, highly customizable era where a vertical open source solution such as the Magento e-commerce system was the standard. That solution was good because it let you customize each part of the process, but you had to host things yourself, taking on all the related risks, and the<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> customization element required continuous maintenance. Therefore, the <strong class="bold">Total Cost of Ownership </strong>(<strong class="bold">TCO</strong>) was very high, and many companies <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>moved to <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) solutions, which come with fewer customization options but are free from maintenance and hosting responsibilities. This reduction of friction made e-commerce more democratic, but in many cases reduced the opportunities for the personalization of e-commerce. For many companies, the uniqueness of their service and the automation of the company's processes are crucial for e-commerce solutions. We're speaking mostly about the big players, but also a lot of start-ups got their success by thinking outside the box. The only difference is that a big player can land a mega-vendor solution, where cost grows exponentially but you get results to match. What about normal companies with a limited budget?</p>
			<p>In this scenario, Pimcore fills the gap between fully managed SaaS solutions and mega-vendors. In fact, Pimcore comes with an e-commerce framework that is designed to speed up e-commerce development but doesn't introduce constraints or limitations. In addition, using a stable cloud-based solution, you can reach your low-maintenance-cost target and sleep peacefully during Black Friday, when availability is crucial.</p>
			<p>The other advantage of using Pimcore as an e-commerce platform is that thanks to its multisite feature, it can handle B2B and B2C and obviously doesn't need any data integration, as there is PIM under the hood.</p>
			<p>If you are not convinced yet, just read this shortlist of must-have features for an enterprise e-commerce solution<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> that Pimcore happens to offer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Complicated pricing and product structures</li>
				<li>Complex availability computation</li>
				<li>Agile projects with evolving needs</li>
				<li>Individual design and checkouts</li>
				<li>Multiple catalogs, currencies, price lists, and product views</li>
				<li>Multiple frontend apps and flexible promotions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the first three sections of this chapter, we have discovered what Pimcore is and we have looked at<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> its features. This has been a great overview of the product, but we need to understand why we should use it in more detail. In the next section, we will learn about the benefits that the adoption of Pimcore brings.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Learning about Pimcore's benefits</h1>
			<p>The fact that <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>Pimcore gives us great opportunities doesn't mean that it's definitely the right tool for you. You could assert that there are many other solutions on the market and that you could mix multiple solutions to achieve the same result. There are also many other mega-vendors selling integrated solutions. So, the question is, what are the benefits of Pimcore? In other words, what can it give us that is better than other solutions?</p>
			<p>To avoid sectionalism, we decided to avoid direct comparisons. However, we want to give you all the tools you need to determine whether Pimcore is the right solution for you. In this section, you will discover the benefits of choosing Pimcore as a DXP solution, PIM, or CMS. With this information, you will be able to make a conclusion on your own.</p>
			<p>In this section, you will discover the most important Pimcore benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rapid innovation</li>
				<li>Unmatched flexibility</li>
				<li>A solid platform</li>
				<li>Used by the masses</li>
				<li>Easy web development</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Rapid innovation</h2>
			<p>It is often not a question of cost, but of time. The market changes quickly, and every company needs to keep up with the times. The only option is to be ready for change. This leads us to rapid innovation. In many cases, having vertical tools, selecting software, and then activating a project is too slow a process. Maybe it is the best process, theoretically speaking, but it requires a lot of time and often is not in keeping with the market's trends and speed. You should be one step ahead of the market, planning investments before you need them, but this is not always feasible. Nobody has a crystal ball. And planning and spending in advance is a risk because you don't know what the future holds. </p>
			<p>In this scenario, Pimcore is the right tool. This framework already has the most important components for enabling digital innovation and can be activated at any point, without any cost. This is the best approach for a start-up or growing company that makes timing their<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> priority. Pimcore helps companies to start with small projects and build their target solution step by step, reducing the risk and rework. You can simply scale with your needs, or better, you can start your next idea faster and with less risk.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Unmatched flexibility </h2>
			<p>As we have already said, data management gives us unmatched flexibility. It helps in headless scenarios, regular CMS, or enterprise applications. Thanks to the extensible APIs system, there is no limit to the user's needs. Implementing a solution is just a matter of time, not feasibility. Plus, the cost in terms of resources and time implementing data management is reduced because it is all managed by a web UI.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>A solid platform</h2>
			<p>Pimcore is a great tool supported by a great <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>framework, <strong class="bold">Symfony</strong>. This PHP framework brings many advantages that make development easier:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Strong modular division of code (into bundles)</li>
				<li>The separation between app and framework</li>
				<li>Dependency injection</li>
				<li>Tons of components and documentation</li>
				<li>The power of Composer for managing packages</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The adoption of Symfony helps to create a standard code structure and speed up web application creation. Moreover, Symfony helps improve your application's performance by implementing a bytecode cache that works natively. Pimcore is fully written on top of Symfony, using it under the hood, and has the same fluid developer experience.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Used by the masses</h2>
			<p>The Pimcore <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>platform is used by more than 100,000 companies in 56 countries. Its open source community has thousands of followers. Support from international funding ensures product development continuity, and new features come year by year. Pimcore has got many awards, including from the analysts Gartner and Forrester, the most important advisors in the market. This gives us extra confidence when betting on it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Web development is made easy</h2>
			<p>When you leave the comfort zone of a web CMS, such as when adding web pages or blog articles, you often fall into situations where you need to code. This means, in most cases, defining the data structure, mapping it using an <strong class="bold">Object-Relational Mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">ORM</strong>) tool, and <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>finally interacting with data by implementing reading/saving routines. If you want to publish this functionality as web APIs, you may need to take additional steps. </p>
			<p>The development process is composed of a small number of activities that each bring value, such as modeling your business logic and doing a lot of other repetitive tasks, including data modeling or exposing APIs. Such boring tasks need to be carried out because otherwise, your project will not work. Ideally, we would like to put our effort only into the tasks that give us real value. Automating what is automatable will save time and prevent human error. </p>
			<p>Pimcore helps in this situation by doing all the repetitive stuff for you. All you need to do is just log into the browser, configure what you need, and then you are set with data management. All the time you save can be invested in more valuable things, such as providing a better experience for the user.</p>
			<p>Now it should be clear what benefits Pimcore can bring to any company and why we should use it to <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>boost digital transformation. Pimcore is our ally for everything from building a simple website to creating a complex application. In the next section, we will focus on Pimcore's lice<a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>nsing and how it can help us to reduce friction with its adoption.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Learning about the benefits of using open source software</h1>
			<p>Most people think that the best reason for using something that's open source is getting a software solution for free. The opportunity to get a product free of charge is appealing, but it shouldn't be the main motivation for selecting an <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>open source product.</p>
			<p>In this section, you will learn about the most important arguments for adopting open source software such as Pimcore and all the advantages of a Pimcore solution:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Speed and agility</li>
				<li>Shared maintenance costs</li>
				<li>Transparency and security</li>
				<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
				<li>Community</li>
				<li>Pimcore licensing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look at each in turn.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Speed and agility</h2>
			<p>An open <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>source product is ready to go. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>download and install it, and then you are ready to work with it. You can also test it without worrying about trials or cost explosions during the growth of your project. Open source software comes with a ton of plugins that allow you to activate features rapidly without development costs. Moreover, you have the source code, so if something doesn't work as you need it to, you can work on it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Shared maintenance costs</h2>
			<p>The core of an <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>open source project is maintained by the community. This has a big advantage over an approach where you build entire custom software from scratch and you need to maintain it yourself. With an open source project, you are responsible only for maintaining your customizations, which usually constitute a small layer on top of the platform. If you create software from scratch instead, you are responsible for the maintenance of 100% of the code. Moreover, if you develop a module that could be useful for the community, you can share it open source and the community can benefit from it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Transparency and security</h2>
			<p>The source code<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> is public. This means that not only can you see how it works, but also the rest of the world. As the user, you can trust open source software because such software will not contain tricks; otherwise, the community would have found them and rejected the project. Moreover, speaking about security, this transparency means any issues emerge rapidly and are resolved rapidly.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Cost-effectiveness</h2>
			<p>Starting with no<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> fee, you can adopt an open source solution without any obligations and then scale it up. Many open source products have a "pro" version that has more features. Well, in this case, you only start paying once you have started to use the product, and the cost is sustainable for such a<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> useful tool.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Community</h2>
			<p>Another<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> important point is the community. It helps to provide documentation, test the product, and give answers to your questions. It would be impossible to compete with a community composed of thousands of members. There isn't any company in the world that can do this alone.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Pimcore licensing</h2>
			<p>The public version of Pimcore is called <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>the <strong class="bold">Community Edition</strong> and is licensed using GNU General Public License (GPL-3). For an enterprise that needs wider support and additional features, Pimcore offers an enterprise<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> license called <strong class="bold">Pimcore Commercial License</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCL</strong>).</p>
			<p>This solution makes Pimcore the perfect alternative to commercial enterprise solutions offered by mega-vendors. You aren't limited to buying software, and you won't face any vendor lock-in. Moreover, if you don't want to use a GPL license, you can simply avoid it, keeping full ownership of your code. This is useful if you are going to create a product based on Pimcore and you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>keep your <strong class="bold">Intellectual Property</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>) safe. In many cases, you can customize the product using modules from the community or third-party vendors.</p>
			<p>Finally, the open source aspect means it's your choice as to whether you deploy on-premises or in the cloud. The cloud solution, supported by a number of SaaS offerings, helps to reduce costs and build a solution that has all the advantages of typical on-premises open source solutions (customization and ownership, for instance) and the advantages of the cloud (for example, low TOC and high performance).</p>
			<p>For software companies who want to get the most out of Pimcore, and remove the legal constraints of the GPLv3<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> license, there<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> is the <strong class="bold">Pimcore Enterprise Subscription</strong> option. This subscription <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>unlocks all the commercial services and products, such as the Pimcore Enterprise Extensions (<strong class="bold">Pimcore</strong> <strong class="bold">Experience Portals</strong>, <strong class="bold">Product Data Syndication</strong>, and so on). The Enterprise subscription gives access <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>to the <strong class="bold">Long Term Support</strong> (<strong class="bold">LTS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Service-Level Agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>). In<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> simple words, it adds special features that may save a lot of time (and money) in medium and large business scenarios, plus additional warranties with high-quality support.</p>
			<p>To summarize all the benefits of open source in just one sentence, an open source solution is one that <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>can be customized without any limits, where code is transparent and safe, that is available for free, and that still retains the benefits of the cloud.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about what Pimcore is, not stopping at the definition but going deep into Pimcore's capabilities. Pimcore is a very flexible platform that can deliver many solutions without reinventing the wheel. By using it, you will experience the comfort of always having the right solution for your needs.</p>
			<p>Pimcore comes with many interesting features (PIM, CMS, DAM, and MDM), and it is ready to use with a low-friction licensing model. Once you have adopted it to satisfy a single requirement, such as a CMS, you have all the other features available, and you can activate them as your needs evolve.</p>
			<p>Now that this chapter is finished, you are ready to start the practical part. The first step will be to learn how to install and configure Pimcore on your PC. This lesson is very important for starting using Pimcore and being ready for all the lessons that will come later.</p>
