			<p>A workshop <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>provides a place for students in a class to see an example project, upload their individual projects, and see and assess each other's projects. They are ideal for courses that include higher-level orders of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, beginning with Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. When a teacher requires each student to assess the work of several other students, the workshop becomes a powerful collaborative grading tool. It is also an ideal tool for peer review. </p>
			<p>Workshops are ideal for putting into practice a theory or a technique. They allow students to apply the concepts and also to take a building block approach, with guidance and help along each step of the way. In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Determining the best time to use a workshop</li>
				<li>Identifying when to incorporate group projects into the workshop</li>
				<li>Implementing various types of workshop strategies</li>
				<li>Detailing the main phases or parts of a workshop</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to applying knowledge, workshops encourage group projects and collaboration. The advantage of a workshop over using a wiki or a glossary as a collaborative project is that the workshops allow more options for bundling materials and activities, and there are also more options for assessment. Additionally, in the current learning environment that blends synchronous and asynchronous content, workshops can include "live" or synchronous presentations or panel discussions. </p>
			<p>Moodle 4.0 has been designed for maximum flexibility. Workshops can be 100% online and also be done in conjunction with a face-to-face workshop with corporate or not-for-profit activities and training. They can be synchronous, asynchronous, or hybrid. Moodle 4.0's newly redesigned navigation helps students quickly find their way to the collaborative activities, and an updated dashboard can be configured so that students receive notice on the dashboard when a team member has posted. With one click, they're where they need to be. Furthermore, the workshop allows you to use a building block approach, where the concepts form the foundational underpinning, and group or individual projects, case studies, and presentations constitute the applications of the core concepts that are a part of the learning outcomes.<a id="_idTextAnchor973"/> By the end of this chapter, you will be able to design and configure a collaborative, peer-review workshop in Moodle. <a id="_idTextAnchor974"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor975"/>Why use a workshop?</h1>
			<p>A workshop is <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>a great way to boost the knowledge and skill level of a group very quickly. It helps people implement social constructivism by learning from each other, namely through peer review. Workshops in Moodle, such as those held in face-to-face settings, are great for getting students up to speed and functional with very little downtime. Usually, they focus on a single outcome, and they pare down the focus to ensure that the specific skill or knowledge set is achievable in a short period of time. For example, let's say that you have a course in entrepreneurship and the students are preparing to make group presentations on their start-up companies. A workshop gives them the perfect platform to develop and hone their presentations as a team and then present them to the overall class as a group. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Workshop</strong> activity icon has been redesigned and deployed in Moodle 4.0. Notice how the new design emphasizes the idea that more than one person participates in a workshop, and that it involves communication and collaboration: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer283" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.01_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1: Workshop icon&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Workshop icon</p>
			<p>In Moodle, the ideal workshops are collaborative and they require students to interact with peer reviews and share knowledge and information. Further, they involve creativity that is focused on the course learning objectives and outcomes. They are flexible and allow you to use both synchronous and asynchronous delivery. So, for example, if you have final presentations that are "live" and you'd also like to archive them, the Workshop gives you the perfect platform. Individuals work together to create their final products such as presentations. Then, they log into the institution's webinar platform (for example, Zoom, Teams, BigBlueButton, or even YouTube Live), and everyone can view it, comment, and save it for later in the archive.</p>
			<p>If your<a id="_idIndexMarker802"/> students are very creative and would like to conduct their workshop collaborations and final presentations in a virtual world, they might want to use Facebook's Metaverse or record themselves interacting via avatars in Google Earth VR. For example, the workshop might be a field trip for geology to look at other locations using "street view" on Google Earth.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will look at when to incorporate group projects inside a workshop.<a id="_idTextAnchor976"/><a id="_idTextAnchor977"/><a id="_idTextAnchor978"/> </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor979"/>When are group project-based workshops best?</h1>
			<p>Although students<a id="_idIndexMarker803"/> might initially dread having to work in a group, bear in mind that their hesitation usually has to do with feeling uncomfortable about the mechanics and feeling shy. After they feel a sense of competence and confidence, working together to complete a project can be one of the most fruitful learning experiences of their education. Not only do they learn about a topic or skill, but they also practice interacting with each other and their "soft skills" while working in a distributed environment, much like the one we work in today in our cloud-based, global workplace.</p>
			<p>However, to avoid frustration, it's important to carefully choose how and when you have students work in groups. If you know your students have widely varying schedules, live in different time zones, and have variable access to high-speed internet, you might need to give them certain guidelines so that they will be very supportive of each other.</p>
			<p>Group projects work best in many different situations. What they all have in common is that people are truly learning from each other:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The students need to show competency in the same thing (for example, how to build a tiny home).</li>
				<li>The students do not have a lot of time, and the outcome needs to be very concrete and focused (for example, a market study for building a day spa as a part of a casino expansion).</li>
				<li>The outcome is easily evaluated; for example, the products can include a written report, graphics, maps, a presentation, and a video, all of which are uploaded onto the cloud and a link is provided (to avoid the problem of file size limitations).</li>
				<li>Individuals are motivated, and they see a concrete value in the ultimate product of the workshop. For example, the workshop product can help individuals lan<a id="_idTextAnchor980"/>d a job, launch a consulting business, or develop social media presence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The skills being developed require interaction and live demonstrations, followed by activities that require the application of the concepts. Additionally, knowledge transfer is most effective if the participants are asking questions, interacting with each other, and doing informal peer assessments. </p>
			<p>Once you think about <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>your course, your learning objectives, and the potential for topics for group projects, it is good to move on to develop specific strategies that align your students with their activities and outcomes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor981"/>The big questions</h2>
			<p>The fields in the workshop window give you many choices. No matter what you enter in each field, your many decisions can be summed up as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What will you have each student do? Create a file offline and upload it to the workshop? Write a journal entry? Participate in an online chat? Perform some offline activity and report on it via an email or wiki? While the workshop window enables a student to upload a file, you can also expect another activity from the student. What kinds of assignments will be expected, and where will they be uploaded? For example, if there are synchronous presentations in BigBlueButton (or Teams or Zoom), where will the recording be uploaded? Where will you put the link? </li>
				<li>Who will assess assignments? Will a teacher assess all assignments? Will students be expected to assess other students' assignments? Will each student self-assess their work?</li>
				<li>How will the assignments be assessed? Bear in mind that you can use a rubric to set out the criteria on which each assignment is assessed, the grading scale, and the type of grading. When will students be allowed to submit their assignments and assessments? A good resource is Moodle Docs, which can be viewed at <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_4.0_release_notes">https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_4.0_release_notes</a>. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The assignment becomes available as soon as you show it. However, you can expect students to assess an example before being allowed to submit their own work; additionally, you can set a deadline to submit the assessment.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at an example <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>to demonstrate how it works. Bear in mind that this example is from the Moodle.org Mount Orange School demo site, which you can access at <a href="http://www.moodle.org">http://www.moodle.org</a>. </p>
			<p>In this case, the workshop involves the following scenario: </p>
			<p>Imagine that you are a screenwriter and have been asked to adapt the setting of La Haine for your own country. Your peers will assess you on how suitable your adaptation is. </p>
			<p>Here is what the description looks like in Moodle 4.0: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer284" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – An example of a workshop project</p>
			<p>Next, let's take a look at the workshop strategi<a id="_idTextAnchor982"/>es.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor983"/>Workshop strategies</h1>
			<p>Workshops <a id="_idIndexMarker806"/>can be ungraded, peer-graded, instructor-graded, or a combination of peer- and instructor-graded. Workshops enable you to create very specific assessment criteria for graders to use. Also, workshops let you set due dates to submit grading work. You can use these and other features to build a strategy to make the best use of workshops within your courses:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer285" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.Table_10.1.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Bear in mind that if you include peer assessments and required peer interactions, you'll be facilitating peer-to-peer learning. In other words, students will be learning from each other as they collaborate and create joint projec<a id="_idTextAnchor984"/><a id="_idTextAnchor985"/><a id="_idTextAnchor986"/>ts. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor987"/>Peer assessment of submissions</h2>
			<p>One<a id="_idIndexMarker807"/> strategy for workshops is to have students assess each other's work before that same work is submitted as a graded assignment. For example, you can create a workshop in which students assess each other's subject matter, outlines, and hypotheses for their term papers, or they can assess each other's photos for specific technical and artistic cr<a id="_idTextAnchor988"/>iteria before they are submitted to the instructor for grading purposes. Additionally, you can ask students to assess their synchronous or recorded presentations with a special emphasis on real-world applicat<a id="_idTextAnchor989"/>ion. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor990"/>The timing of submissions and assessments</h2>
			<p>Workshops<a id="_idIndexMarker808"/> enable you to set different due dates in order to submit work and assess other students' work. If you set both due dates at the same, many students might submit their work just before the submission deadline so that they cannot be assessed at all before the assessment deadline. Consider setting the submission deadline well before the assessment deadline. So, before opening up the assessment ability to students, examine the work submitted and ensure that it's close to what you expected or were trying to elicit from students. You might even want to use the time between the submission and assessment to<a id="_idTextAnchor991"/> refine your assessment criteria in response to the work subm<a id="_idTextAnchor992"/><a id="_idTextAnchor993"/>itted.</p>
			<p>After you have <a id="_idIndexMarker809"/>developed your workshop strategies and set up the workshop in Moodle, you'll now enter into the actual functioning of the workshop. For convenience, it's useful to look at it as four phases or parts of the workshop. They consist of the setup, submission, assessment, and grading evalu<a id="_idTextAnchor994"/>ation. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor995"/>The four phases</h1>
			<p>When you run a workshop, you will go through four phases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 1</strong>: The <em class="italic">setup</em> phase<a id="_idIndexMarker810"/> is when you create a workshop and choose settings <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>for how it will work. You will learn more about the settings in the section entitled, <em class="italic">The setup phase - the edit settings page</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 2</strong>: The <em class="italic">submission</em> phase is when students submit their work. Also, each student will be <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>given assignments to assess the work of some other<a id="_idIndexMarker813"/> students. The assessments can be allocated automatically by a system, or a teacher can manually allocate assessments to students. Either way, at the end of the submission phase, each student will have submitted their work and been told to assess the work of one or several other students. Bear in mind that work is often submitted via a link to a cloud-hosted location for videos, audio, presentations, and more. This is important in order to avoid the file size limitations in Moodle. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 3</strong>: During<a id="_idIndexMarker814"/> the <em class="italic">assessment</em> phase, students will assess each <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>other's work. The teacher will create assessment forms that students will use when conducting their assessments of each other's work. The forms will include prompts to encourage interaction and learning from each other. Their focus will be guided by the learning objectives. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 4</strong>: During the <em class="italic">grading evaluation</em> phase, students are given grades for how well they evaluated<a id="_idIndexMarker816"/> the work of their peers. This is the<a id="_idIndexMarker817"/> final phase of the workshop. Grading will tie to rubrics and also reinforce the corresponding levels of Bloom's taxonomy to make sure that you're achieving the learning objectives<a id="_idTextAnchor996"/> of the course.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next section, we will look at each phase o<a id="_idTextAnchor997"/>f the workshop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor998"/>The setup phase – the edit settings page</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker818"/> workshop<a id="_idIndexMarker819"/> activity is a powerful teaching tool that has many settings to consider. In the following description, we will just consider the important ones. Workshops are designed so that a student's work can be submitted and offered for peer review within a structured framework. There are several fields under a workshop, which will be explained in the following sections. They provide a place for students and teachers in the class to make the best use of Moodle:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer286" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – Customizable fields when setting up a workshop</p>
			<h3>Name and description</h3>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker820"/> settings under <strong class="bold">General</strong> partially answer the question, what will you have each student do? Be sure to describe the activity and to use the verbs that correspond to the level of Bloom's taxonomy. For example, if you have an entrepreneurship course and you're developing presentations for a <em class="italic">Shark Tank</em> pitch competition for start-ups, your description could be to create presentations for the pitches. You can use verbs such as design, assemble, construct, develop, or<a id="_idIndexMarker821"/> formulate (especially if you're asking them to incorporate a strategy): </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – Adding the name and description of the workshop</p>
			<p>Your students <a id="_idIndexMarker822"/>will see and click on the <strong class="bold">Workshop name</strong> field. The <strong class="bold">Descr<a id="_idTextAnchor999"/>iption</strong> field should give instructions on how to comp<a id="_idTextAnchor1000"/>lete the workshop.</p>
			<h3>Grading settings</h3>
			<p>These<a id="_idIndexMarker823"/> fields determine the maximum points a student can earn for a workshop and how to calculate these points, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer288" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5 – Configuring the<a id="_idTextAnchor1001"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1002"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1003"/> grading settings</p>
			<h4>The grading strategy</h4>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker824"/>workshop assignment is quite flexible in terms of the type of grading scheme used. This setting determines the overall scheme. This is a huge "plus" if your organization uses synchronous web conferencing as a primary strategy for student engagement and collaborative learning. You can set up your grading so that students receive points for their collaborative learning online (synchronous or asynchronous) and also for the final product. </p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Accumulative grading</strong> strategy, the grades are normalized so that they are out of 100 and then weighted. This style of grading enables you to present the reviewer with a numeric scale. Additionally, you can also present the reviewer with <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> or <strong class="bold">No</strong> questions. One of the questions is does this workshop meet the requirement? Alternatively, you can present the reviewer with a grading scale, such as <strong class="bold">poor</strong>, <strong class="bold">fair</strong>, <strong class="bold">good</strong>, and <strong class="bold">excellent</strong>. If you do use a <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> or <strong class="bold">No</strong> question, or a grading scale, you will assign a point value to each response. Consider informing the reviewer of the value of each response. For example, instead of just writing poor, fair, good, and excellent, consider writing poor (1 point), fair (2 points), good (3 points), and excellent (4 points).</p>
			<p>When <strong class="bold">Comments</strong> is selected for <strong class="bold">Grading strategy</strong>, students can comment on each assessment element, but they cannot select a grade. However, teachers can grade students' comments. In this case, the workshop is transformed from where students grade each other to where the teacher grades each student's comments. The comments can be used for the collaborative "live" synchronous segments and asynchronous activities. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">A workshop that uses <strong class="bold">Comments</strong> might be especially useful when you want to have a structured discussion on material that you present to students.</p>
			<p>As a course<a id="_idIndexMarker825"/> creator, you can present your students with material that has been uploaded to the workshop or use the workshop's description to direct students to the material they must assess. After the students have viewed the material, they enter the workshop and leave comments according to the elements presented. As the workshop requires students to comment on clearly defined evaluation elements, the students' discussion is structured and kept on track.</p>
			<p>When you choose the <strong class="bold">Number of Errors</strong> option, students evaluate a workshop with a series of <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> or <strong class="bold">No</strong> questions. Usually, you create questions to evaluate whether or not the submission met a requirement, such as <strong class="source-inline">does the student have a variety of opinions?</strong></p>
			<p>When writing one of these questions, ensure that it can be answered using only <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> or <strong class="bold">No</strong>. A sign that you need to revise your question is the presence of the word "or." For example, don't write "Did the student describe the plant well enough to distinguish it from others?" or "Is there still doubt as to which plant the student is describing?" Such a question cannot be answered with yes or no.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, the answer to an evaluation question is very clear, and sometimes it is subjective. For example, the question "Did the student describe the plant well enough to distinguish it from others?" is subjective. One reviewer might think that the student did an adequate job of describing the plant, while another might think otherwise. These questions can be a good way to perform subjective peer evaluations of each student's work.</p>
			<p>If the work requires a more objective evaluation (such as "Did the student include all five identifying features covered in this lesson?"), you might not need a workshop. This kind of objective evaluation can be easily performed by the teacher using an assignment.</p>
			<p>For a rubric grading strategy, write several statements that apply to the project. Each statement has a grade assigned to it. The reviewers choose the one statement that best describes the project. This single choice completes the review.</p>
			<p>You can create several such elements; the reviewers must select a statement for each of them.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Grade for submission</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker826"/> maximum number of points a student can be given by a grader.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Grade for assessments</strong> is the grade that the student receives to grade other submissions. This grade is based on how close the assessment the student completes is to the average of all assessments for the same submission. For example, student A submits work, and students B, C, and, D assess the work and give scores of 10, 9, and 5. The average assessment is 8, so students B and C will receive higher marks for their assessments than student D. In essence, the grade for assessments is a grade given that evaluates how well a student assesses other students' work.</p>
			<h3>The Submission settings</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Submission settings</strong> page<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> is where you enter instructions for your users. Additionally, you set limits on how many files students can upload to the workshop and how large those files can be. Often, it is best to include a link to the recording that they have uploaded to YouTube, Screencast-O-Matic, or even Slideshare if it is a presentation without a video. A team presentation might be the easiest to accomplish by having everyone log on and create a recording with Zoom or Teams, and then placing a link to it, rather than downloading the video file. In your instructions to the users, be sure to refer back to the assignment instructions.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot is of the <strong class="bold">Submission settings</strong> page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer289" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.06_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – Configuring the Submission settings page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6 – Configuring the Subm<a id="_idTextAnchor1004"/>ission settings page</p>
			<p>The user will see the <strong class="bold">Instructions for submission</strong> label when they click on the workshop.</p>
			<p>Both <strong class="bold">Maximum number of submission attachments</strong> and <strong class="bold">Maximum submission attachment size</strong> determine the size of a file and how many <a id="_idIndexMarker828"/>files the user can upload.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Late submissions</strong> option allows users to submit their work after the deadline. The deadline can be set further down the page.</p>
			<h3>Functionality booster</h3>
			<p>You might <a id="_idIndexMarker829"/>ask your students to provide a narrated presentation or a video. These files can be quite large; however, in today's world, students will need to be able to create video content. It is a good idea to encourage students to upload their work to the cloud and then provide a link. For example, this can work with presentations in Screenca<a id="_idTextAnchor1005"/>st-O-Matic or a video on YouTube. You can upload videos to Teams, Google Drive, or other platforms, depending on the size. If you are recording on a platform such as Zoom, you will not have to upload it because it will already be there. </p>
			<p>However, the downside is that access to the recording could expire. In that case, you might wish to download it too. This will help students avoid hitting the file size limit. You might wish to confine the apps to YouTube or Screencast-O-Matic and avoid TikTok, Facebook (Meta), Instagram, or other alternative platforms such as Rumble, Twitch, Odysee, BitChute, and more. It really depends on your institution and how stable the<a id="_idTextAnchor1006"/> apps and platforms are.</p>
			<h3>Assessment settings</h3>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker830"/> section, the settings are used to give the users instructions on how to perform their assessments and determine when to present the user with examples to assess.</p>
			<p>The actual criteria used in the assessment are not created on this page. Instead, the criteria are created under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Workshop administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Assessment form</strong>.</p>
			<p>We will cover the process of how to create the assessment form later. However, on this page, we will just give the user instructions for the assessment:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7 – Configuring t<a id="_idTextAnchor1007"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1008"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1009"/>he assessment settings </p>
			<h3>Feedback settings</h3>
			<p>If the <strong class="bold">Overall feedback</strong> mode<a id="_idIndexMarker831"/> is enabled, a textbox appears at the bottom of the assessment form. Students who will perform assessments can enter feedback into this textbox. You can make these comment<a id="_idTextAnchor1010"/>s optional or required.</p>
			<p>The settings for feedback attachments determine whether the person who is assessing can upload a file(s) with their assessment. The student who submitted the work will see the attachment(s) with the assessment.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Conclusion</strong> field gives the teacher a place to write a message that students can see after the workshop has finished. For example, you can instruct students<a id="_idIndexMarker832"/> to produce a new piece of work based on the feedback that they received during the workshop, ins<a id="_idTextAnchor1011"/>truct them to write a blog post reflecting on the activity, or just congratulate<a id="_idTextAnchor1012"/> them on a job well done.</p>
			<h3>Example submissions settings</h3>
			<p>If the workshop<a id="_idIndexMarker833"/> uses examples, users can assess examples of work provided by the teacher. The user's assessment of the example is then compared to the assessment provided by the teacher. This enables users to practice assessing work before they assess each other's work:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer291" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.08_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – The Submissions settings page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8 – The Submissions settings page</p>
			<p>Users<a id="_idIndexMarker834"/> receive a grade for how well their assessment agrees w<a id="_idTextAnchor1013"/>ith the assessment provided by the teacher. However, the grade is not <a id="_idTextAnchor1014"/>counted in the grade book.</p>
			<h3>Availability settings</h3>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker835"/>settings in this section answer the following question: when will students be allowed to submit their assignments and assessments?</p>
			<p>Note that the submissions and assessments can open on the same day. However, assessments cannot open before submissions (as there would be nothing to assess).</p>
			<p>If you enable the <strong class="bold">Switch to the next phase</strong> setting after the submission deadline, then after the submission deadline, the workshop will automatically switch to the assessment phase. If you do not enable this setting, the teacher will have to manually advance the workshop to the assessment phase:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.9 – Availability</p>
			<p>If you have<a id="_idIndexMarker836"/> the workshop automatically advanced to the assessment phase, you should also have the workshop automatically allocate assessments to the students. If the workshop doesn't automatically assign assessments to the students, it will advance to the assessment phase; there will be no assessments for students to perform. Setting up automatic allocations is performed under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Workshop administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Submissions allocation</strong> | <strong class="bold">Scheduled allocation</strong>:</p>

			<h3>The edit assessment form page</h3>
			<p>On<a id="_idIndexMarker837"/> this page, you enter the assessment criteria. The criteria should map to learning outcomes. So, you should refer to Bloom's taxonomy and use the verbs that correspond with the cognition levels. For example, if you are asking students to create a workshop that presents a pitch to attract investment to a start-up company, you might wish to use the verbs "design" or "develop" to indicate the higher-order act of creating. The exact contents of this page will change, depending on the type of assessment that you selected on the workshop settings page. In the following screenshot, the workshop grading strategy is set to <strong class="bold">Accumulative grading</strong>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.11 – Setting the aspects in the A<a id="_idTextAnchor1018"/>ccumulative grading screen</p>
			<p>Making the maximum grade a multiple of the number of assessment elements enables students to more easily interpret their grades. For example, let's suppose a workshop is assessed for five elements. For each element, the assessor will choose from four statements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">A</strong>: The workshop does not meet this requirement in any way (0 points).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">B</strong>: The workshop partially meets this requirement (1 point).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">C</strong>: The workshop meets this requirement (2 points).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">D</strong>: The workshop exceeds this requirement (3 points).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> assign a point value of zero for each A selection, one point for each B selection, two points for each C selection, and three points for each D selection. Then, each element will be worth a maximum of three points. With five elements, the workshop will have a maximum grade of 15. This will make it easy for the student to interpret their grade.</p>
			<p>When the student conducts an assessment, the assessment form looks similar to the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Note that for each assessment criteria, the st<a id="_idTextAnchor1019"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1020"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1021"/>udent can enter comments. </p>
			<h3>Adding an example to the workshop</h3>
			<p>After you<a id="_idIndexMarker839"/> save the workshop settings and the assessment form, you can add an example to your workshop. Selecting a workshop will give you something similar to the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer296" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.13_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.13 – Setting up an example for your workshop&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.13 – Setting up an example for your workshop</p>
			<p>To add an example submission, let's begin by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add example submission</strong> button. In this case, it's the collaboratively created PowerPoint presentation that is the team's "pitch deck" for the <em class="italic">Shark Tank</em> workshop. This brings you to a page that displays the same assessment instructions that your users will see. This is where you can upload th<a id="_idTextAnchor1022"/>e example to be assessed:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer297" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.14_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.14 – How to upload the example to be assessed&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.14 – How to upload the example to be assessed</p>
			<p>To assess a <a id="_idIndexMarker840"/>submission, switch to the assessment phase and then scroll down to see the names of the people in the workshop and their submissions. Click on the submission to open it and begin to provide feedback:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer298" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.15_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.15 – Clicking on the name of the submission to assess it&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.15 – Clicking on the name of the submission to assess it</p>
			<p>After you <a id="_idIndexMarker841"/>assess the example, Moodle returns you to the workshop's home page. You will see the progress that you have made, which is indicated on this page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer299" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.16_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.16 – Switching to the evaluation phase; the current phase is gold&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.16 – Switching to the evaluation phase; <a id="_idTextAnchor1023"/>the current phase is gold</p>
			<p>Note that the next step will be for the teacher to allocate the student submissions for assessment. However, no one has submitted anything yet. At thi<a id="_idTextAnchor1024"/>s point, the teacher waits for stude<a id="_idTextAnchor1025"/>nts to submit their work.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor1026"/>The submission phase – students submit their work</h2>
			<p>Although<a id="_idIndexMarker842"/> the teacher has finished setting up the workshop and is ready<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> for students to submit their work, students might still see this message: <strong class="bold">The workshop is currently being set up. Wait until this is switched to the next phase</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">The teacher must manually switch the workshop from one phase to the next. Even if you're done with the setup and are ready to accept submissions, Moodle doesn't know that.</p>
			<p>To switch to the next phase, the teacher must click on the light bulb before this phase. In our example, the teacher clicked on the light bulb before the submission phase and saw the following message:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer300" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.17_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.17 – Switching the workshop back into the submission phase&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.17 – Switching the workshop back<a id="_idTextAnchor1027"/> into the submission phase</p>
			<p>Now, when <a id="_idIndexMarker844"/>a student selects this workshop, they will see a prompt to <a id="_idIndexMarker845"/>submit their work:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer301" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.18_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.18 – The screen showing how to update the instructions for submissions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.18 – The screen showing how to update the instructions for submissions</p>
			<p>Note that the student can also assess the example at this point. In the settings page for <strong class="bold">Mode of examples assessment</strong> in this workshop, we selected <strong class="bold">Voluntary</strong>; therefore, this example is not required: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer302" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.19_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 10.19 – The Mode of examples assessment option is set to voluntary&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.19 – The Mode of examples assessment option is set to voluntary</p>
			<p>If we had <a id="_idIndexMarker846"/>made assessing the example mandatory, the student <a id="_idIndexMarker847"/>would receive a message indicating that they cannot submit work until th<a id="_idTextAnchor1028"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1029"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1030"/>e example has been assessed.</p>
			<h3>Allocating submissions</h3>
			<p>As soon as students<a id="_idIndexMarker848"/> begin submitting their work, you can start allocating these submissions to other students for assessment. Do this under <strong class="bold">Workshop administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Submissions allocation</strong>. You can allocate submissions manually or randomly.</p>
			<p>If you perform a random allocation, all the submissions that were sent up to that point in time will be allocated to other students for assessment. However, submissions sent after the random allocation will not be automatically allocated. Yo<a id="_idTextAnchor1031"/>u will need to perform another random allocation for the next submission, and so on un<a id="_idTextAnchor1032"/>til the workshop is complete.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor1033"/>The assessment phase</h2>
			<p>When you move the<a id="_idIndexMarker849"/> workshop to the assessment phase, the allocations<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> that you made during the submission phase become available to studen<a id="_idTextAnchor1034"/>ts. In this phase, students will actually assess each other's work. All the work submitted for assessment appears on a single screen: the left-hand column includes the students' names, the middle columns are for the links to the file to submit, and the right-hand columns include the grades received and the grades given: </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor1036"/>The grading evaluation phase</h2>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker851"/>move the workshop to this phase, you can tell<a id="_idIndexMarker852"/> Moodle to automatically calculate the grades of students. Additionally, you can also override these g<a id="_idTextAnchor1037"/>rades and enter your own grades.</p>
			<p>Note that, at this stage, students can no longer modify the submissions that they have sent in:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor1041"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Moodle offers several options for student-to-student and student-to-teacher interactions. When deciding which social activities to use, consider the level of structure and amount of student-to-student/student-to-teacher interaction that you want. For example, chats and wikis offer relatively unstructured environments with lots of opportunities for student-to-student interaction. They are good ways of relinquishing some control of the class to students. A forum offers more structure because entries are classified on the basis of topics. It can be moderated by the teacher, making it even more structured. A workshop offers the most structure, by virtue of the set assessment criteria that students must use when evaluating each other's work.</p>
			<p>Workshops are collaborative. They set the stage for students to learn from each other. Even more than that, they include both formative and summative assessments, which is to say that students can check their progress toward achieving learning outcomes at multiple points along the way. Then, at the end, they have a chance to turn in a summative assessment – a project, presentation, portfolio, or something similar – in a supportive, nurturing setting, because they have been building each building block in a nurturing, supportive, encouraging environment. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn about groups and cohorts, and the differences between the two. You will see how to segregate students on a course into teams. Additionally, you will learn how to manage enrollments in a quick and efficient way using cohorts. In addition, you'll learn how to assess the individual students for their collaborative work. </p>
