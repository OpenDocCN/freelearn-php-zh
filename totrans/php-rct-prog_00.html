This is partly thanks to JavaScript web frameworks such as Angular2 or React, but also because of the increasing popularity of functional and asynchronous programming in languages that support multiple programming paradigms, such as JavaScript, Java, Python, or PHP.</p><p class="calibre8">Nowadays, reactive programming is closely associated with Reactive Extensions (also called ReactiveX or just Rx); the most popular library to leverage reactive programming. Notably, RxJS 5, the JavaScript implementation of Rx, is very likely to be the first encounter with reactive programming for many developers. In this book, we will mostly focus on using the PHP port of Rx, called RxPHP (<a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPHP">https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPHP</a>).</p><p class="calibre8">Asynchronous programming is not what PHP developers typically deal with. In fact, it’s kind of an uncharted territory because there aren’t many resources available on this topic in PHP. Since reactive programming goes hand in hand with asynchronous programming, we’ll work a lot with event loops, blocking and non-blocking code, subprocesses, threads, and IPC.</p><p class="calibre8">Our primary intention, however, will be learning Reactive Extensions and reactive programming with RxPHP. This book includes both RxPHP 1 and RxPHP 2. All examples are written for RxPHP 1 because the API is almost the same, and at the time of writing this book, RxPHP 2 is still in development. Also, RxPHP 1 requires just PHP 5.6+, while RxPHP 2 requires PHP 7+. Nonetheless, we’ll properly emphasize and explain whenever the APIs of RxPHP 1 and RxPHP 2 differ.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre21" id="calibre_pb_1"/>

<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Reactive Programming" href="part0015_split_000.html#E9OE1-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Introduction to Reactive Programming</em></span>, explains definitions of typical programming paradigms such as imperative, asynchronous, functional, parallel, and reactive programming. We’ll see what are the prerequisites to use functional programming in PHP and how all this is related to Reactive Extensions. At the end, we’ll introduce the RxPHP library as a tool of choice for this entire book.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 2. Reactive Programming with RxPHP" href="part0024_split_000.html#MSDG2-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Reactive Programming with RxPHP</em></span>, presents the basic concepts and common terminology used in reactive programming with RxPHP. It introduces Observables, observers, operators, Subjects, and disposables as the building blocks of any Rx application.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. Writing a Reddit Reader with RxPHP" href="part0033_split_000.html#VF2I2-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Writing a Reddit Reader with RxPHP</em></span>, builds on the knowledge from the previous chapter to write a Reddit reader application internally based on RxPHP. This will require downloading data via cURL and handling user input, and comparing the difference between blocking and non-blocking code in PHP in relation to RxPHP. We’ll also have a sneak peak into using event loops in PHP.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. Reactive versus a Typical Event-Driven Approach" href="part0039_split_000.html#1565U2-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Reactive versus a Typical Event-Driven Approach</em></span>, shows that in order to use Rx in practice, we need to know how can we combine RxPHP code with some already existing code that isn’t based on Rx. For this reason, we’ll take the Event Dispatcher component that comes with the Symfony3 framework and extend it with Rx functionality.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5. Testing RxPHP Code" href="part0043_split_000.html#190861-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Testing RxPHP Code</em></span>, covers testing, which is a crucial part of every development process. Apart from PHPUnit, we’ll also use the special testing classes that come with RxPHP out of the box. We’ll also take a look at testing asynchronous code in general and what caveats we need to be aware of.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 6. PHP Streams API and Higher-Order Observables" href="part0050_split_000.html#1FLS41-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">PHP Streams API and Higher-Order Observables</em></span>, introduces the PHP Streams API and event loops. These two concepts are tightly coupled in RxPHP and we’ll learn why and how. We’ll talk about the issues we can encounter when using multiple event loops in the same application and how the PHP community is trying to solve them. We’ll also introduce the concept of higher-order Observables as a more advanced functionality of Rx.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 7. Implementing Socket IPC and WebSocket Server/Client" href="part0054_split_000.html#1JFUC2-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Implementing Socket IPC and WebSocket Server/Client</em></span>, demonstrates how in order to write a more complicated asynchronous application, we’ll build a chat manager, server, and client as three separate processes that communicate with each other via Unix sockets and WebSockets. We’ll also use in practice the higher-order Observables from the previous chapter.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 8. Multicasting in RxPHP and PHP7 pthreads Extension" href="part0061_split_000.html#1Q5IA1-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Multicasting in RxPHP and PHP7 pthreads Extension</em></span>, introduces us to the concept of multicasting in Rx and all the components that RxPHP provides for this purpose. We’ll also start using the pthreads extension for PHP7. This will let us run our code in parallel in multiple threads.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 9. Multithreaded and Distributed Computing with pthreads and Gearman" href="part0066_split_000.html#1UU542-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Multithreaded and Distributed Computing with pthreads and Gearman</em></span>, wraps the knowledge of pthreads from the previous chapter into reusable components that can be used together with RxPHP. We also introduce the Gearman framework as a way to distribute work among multiple processes. In the end, we’ll compare the pros and cons of using multiple threads and processes to run tasks in parallel.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 10. Using Advanced Operators and Techniques in RxPHP" href="part0070_split_000.html#22O7C1-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Using Advanced Operators and Techniques in RxPHP</em></span>, will focus on not-so-common principles in Rx. These are mostly advanced operators for very specific tasks, but also implementation details of RxPHP components and their behavior in specific use cases that we should be aware of.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter Appendix.  Reusing RxPHP Techniques in RxJS" href="part0081_split_000.html#2D7TI2-bd355a22cf10407cb10df27e65585b8d">Appendix</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre18">Reusing RxPP Techniques in RxJS</em></span>, demonstrates with practical examples how to deal with typical use cases where either RxPHP or RxJS come in handy. We'll see how asynchronous programming is used in a JavaScript environment and compare it to PHP. This final chapter also goes into more detail about what RxJS 5 is and how it differs from RxPHP.</p></div></div>

Some basic knowledge of Composer and PHPUnit is helpful but not absolutely necessary.</p><p class="calibre8">In later chapters, we’ll also use the pthreads PHP extension, which requires PHP 7 or above and the Gearman job server; both should be available for all platforms.</p><p class="calibre8">Also, some basic knowledge of the Unix environment (sockets, processes, signals, and so on) is helpful.</p></div>
