How does the ORM in Magento work? What are observers and events? What were the design patterns used to create Magento?</p><p>More importantly, it will also answer questions that many developers still have, for example, what is the standard to develop modules and extend the frontend and backend? How can I properly test my code? What is the best method to deploy and distribute custom modules?</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
