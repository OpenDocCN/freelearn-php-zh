- en: PhpStorm is a smart PHP IDE that gets your code and understands its structures.
    It provides code autocompletion, refactoring, syntax highlighting, and much more.
    PhpStorm makes debugging and testing really easy, especially with debugger configuration
    validation.

- en: '*PhpStorm Cookbook* contains several tutorials that will allow you to run PHP
    development at a good pace by helping you test and debug, which is often ignored
    by developers.'

- en: The book starts off focusing on how to cook using PhpStorm, gives you an overview
    of PHP development, and then dives deep into the details of refactoring and building
    your project using the PhpStorm IDE. After that, it moves to integrating frameworks
    and testing and debugging them. We then move on to using PhpStorm in a team, using
    Phing and cooking plugins. We conclude that this book will be of a great help
    to a PHP programmer who loves to use IDE and looks forward to working faster.
