That's not to say we are going to discuss the type of layout that involves themes just yet, because there is plenty of work to be done deciding what goes where before we look at things like fonts, colors, and images. While we aren't working with anything as exciting as new images or flashy graphics, you will find that much of what we cover in this section is a matter of taste, and you can get fairly creative.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>So how do we go about building a fully functional website?</em></span> The answer is to use chunks of free‑standing code called modules, which either come as part of the standard Drupal download, or are provided by the good people of the Drupal community. Modules simply sit around waiting till you need them, at which point, Drupal (knowing how to make use of them) calls on all the functionalities provided by the module file(s) in order to fulfill the tasks required of it.<a class="indexterm" id="id100"/>
</p><p>The terms<span class="emphasis"><em> module</em></span> and<span class="emphasis"><em> functionality</em></span>, with respect to Drupal, are synonymous, from the point of view that modules provide functionality. It is possible to add your own functionality directly to your pages too, but that is a slightly different matter, which we will get into later. For now, the discussion of your site's functionality is really a discussion about modules.</p><p>Consequently, in this chapter, we are going to take a close look at:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding modules</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Third-party modules</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring modules</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Menus and primary links</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using modules</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Working with blocks</li></ul></div><p>Be aware that we won't be discussing some of the content-related modules in too much depth, because we will cover the topic of content in great detail on its own, in Chapters 6 and 7. While the focus of this chapter is on getting the basics up and running, we will also look at how to include other modules from the Drupal site in order to demonstrate its power and flexibility. This will also reveal the considerable advantage of having an entire development community at hand to help out.</p><div class="section" title="Adding Modules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec01"/>Adding Modules</h1></div></div></div><p>It is by enabling certain modules that you will be able to achieve a diverse, and more importantly, functional site. As there are tons of modules available, I can't hope to bore you with the all the ins and outs of every single one. Instead, we will enable and briefly work with each of the ones required for the demo site as these will more than likely be the most popular ones in any case.<a class="indexterm" id="id101"/>
</p><p>If you find that there is a module required by your site, which is not covered here, then don't panic, simply follow the same method of enabling and testing that you will see throughout this chapter, and apply it to the specific module. You will be up and running in no time at all!</p><p>Before we begin discussing each individual module, head on over to the<span class="strong"><strong> modules</strong></span> section under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item, and decide which you would like to enable initially, based on your site's forecasted needs. Bear in mind that it is very easy to come back at a later stage and add or remove modules—this is part of the beauty and power of a system like Drupal. For the purposes of the demo site, we will need the following modules for the moment (we will need a few more as we continue building the site):<a class="indexterm" id="id102"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>blog</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>forum</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>locale</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>poll</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>search</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>upload</strong></span></li></ul></div><p>Once you have made a selection, click<span class="strong"><strong> Save configuration</strong></span>, and away you go. Unfortunately, things are not quite as easy as all that, and for at least a few of these modules, we will have to put in some serious thought before we actually implement them on the site. In particular,<span class="strong"><strong> forum</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> locale</strong></span> need to be discussed in some depth. Before we do that, let's take a look at what else is available to us, courtesy of the Drupal community.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Third-Party Modules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec02"/>Third-Party Modules</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the greatest things about Drupal is that it adheres to the open-source paradigm. This fosters community development, which in turn promotes and increases the diversity of any given project. One of the spin-offs from this is that community members who overcome certain obstacles or create something new and useful can, and often do, take the time to share it with everyone else. This is an exceptionally valuable property of most, if not all, open-source projects.</p><p>What this means for us is that we can take a leisurely scroll over a variety of modules that have been made by someone, improved on by someone else, or changed into something else, and pick and choose what we like the most. The converse of this is, of course, that you can make any of your own developments available for everyone else to use when the time comes.<a class="indexterm" id="id103"/>
</p><p>For now, there are certain issues associated with using contributed modules such as the one we are going to incorporate into our site here. It is important to understand that people are providing useful software without enforcing payment. Hopefully, you will take it upon yourself to drop the developers a line every now and then to thank them for any functionality they have spent time and effort on that you may benefit from.</p><p>Secondly, because more often then not there is only one developer or a small group of developers, you need to understand that there is no huge budget, with lots of computer geeks tapping away day and night. This means that contributions, like any software, are subject to bugs or errors, and you should always make sure that your site, including the database, are protected by making backups before implementing any changes. (For more information on properly backing up your site, see<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Running Your Website"> Chapter 10</a>) This is in line with best practices when it comes to dealing with software—if something breaks your code, then it is your responsibility, and not the contributor's.</p><p>With those two rather serious points out of the way, let's begin.</p><div class="section" title="Downloading Modules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec01"/>Downloading Modules</h2></div></div></div><p>The Drupal website houses a list of contributions that are available for you to add under the<span class="strong"><strong> Modules</strong></span> tab of the<span class="strong"><strong> Downloads</strong></span> page (<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/project/modules">http://drupal.org/project/modules</a>). At the top of the<span class="strong"><strong> Modules</strong></span> page there is a selection of Drupal versions from which you can choose the appropriate one, and then browse the modules by name, category, or date, as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id104"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Downloading Modules" src="graphics/1800_04_01.jpg"/></div><p>As we saw in<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Drupal"> Chapter 1</a>, obtaining the correct version is very important because you cannot assume that a module developed for the<span class="strong"><strong> 4.6.x</strong></span> family will work with the latest<span class="strong"><strong> 4.7.x</strong></span> family. In fact, it is probably a bigger issue now than it will be in a year or so, since Drupal has only just reached the<span class="strong"><strong> 4.7.x</strong></span> family. Unfortunately, the upgrading of contributions is not necessarily done at the same time as the core development; so it may be that there are some modules you can only implement in older versions of Drupal—hopefully by the time you read this, most modules, if not all, will have been made compatible with<span class="strong"><strong> 4.7.x</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id105"/>
</p><p>For the purpose of the demo site, one contribution that we will need fairly soon is<span class="strong"><strong> Taxonomy Access Control,</strong></span> which can be found under the<span class="strong"><strong> Categories</strong></span> section, assuming you are searching by category. Navigate there, click<span class="strong"><strong> Download</strong></span>, and save the zipped file to your machine. You might find it more expedient to create a directory, say<code class="literal"> drupal_downloads</code>, to save these files to. Of course, once the module is installed you no longer need the zip file. It may be useful to maintain a copy just in case, but if you are certain you won't need it again, remove it once everything is up and running.<a class="indexterm" id="id106"/>
</p><p>That's all there is to downloading modules. Before we move on, it's a good idea to take a look over the list of all modules available to see what you can actually achieve with Drupal. For example,<span class="emphasis"><em> did you know that you can use Drupal as an e-commerce website, complete with products or services and a shopping cart?</em></span> You can implement all types of payment facilities such as PayPal, or credit cards and pretty much anything else that a fully-fledged online store would need—or will be able to once the<span class="strong"><strong> E-Commerce</strong></span> module has been upgraded to work with 4.7.</p><p>Learning just what you can easily achieve with Drupal modules now can really cut down the amount of time you spend developing or looking for solutions to problems later on.</p></div><div class="section" title="Installing Modules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec02"/>Installing Modules</h2></div></div></div><p>Each module download can be different depending on how it needs to alter the system in order to function. The best way to learn about how to install modules is simply to go ahead and do it. Since we have already downloaded one, let's continue on and install it.<a class="indexterm" id="id107"/>
</p><p>Open up the<code class="literal"> .gz</code> file that you saved on your machine (refer to the previous section). Depending on the module in question you will have anywhere from one file to tens of files. As many will have license information in them, ensure that you take the time to read over these before you go ahead and use them. Apart from that, the first thing you need to do is open up the<code class="literal"> readme</code> file as this will, more than likely, have some detailed information on what you can expect from the module, and how it functions.</p><p>Assuming you are happy you have the right module for the job, the next file to open up is the install file, usually something like<code class="literal"> INSTALL.txt</code>. This will give you a list of instructions to follow in order to set things up properly. More often than not, this involves making some sort of adjustment to your database as well as adding the relevant<code class="literal"> .module</code> file to your<code class="literal"> modules</code> folder under the Drupal home directory.</p><p>Sometimes the developer of the module will add notes to guide your usage of the contribution. For example, in the case of the Taxonomy Access Control module, we are advised not to use it in conjunction with other access-related modules such as<span class="strong"><strong> OG</strong></span> or<span class="strong"><strong> node_privacy_by_role</strong></span>. That doesn't mean you can not—just that you should ensure you know exactly what you are doing before going against suggestions like the one provided with this module.<a class="indexterm" id="id108"/>
</p><p>Another bit of advice that might save you a lot of trouble at some stage in the future is to make a backup of your database, or any important files, before making use of a module. The reason being is that Drupal is moving to a more user-friendly, plug-n-play type of setup where all that you need to do extract the module file to the<code class="literal"> modules</code> folder and away you go. The module itself takes care of any changes required to be made to the database automatically. This makes it easier to install it because you no longer have to issue commands like:<a class="indexterm" id="id109"/>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">$ mysql u&lt;<span class="strong"><strong>username&gt;</strong></span> p drupal &lt;<span class="strong"><strong>C:\apache2triad\htdocs\drupal\modules\taxonomy_access\taxonomy_access.mysql&gt;</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>in order to get things working. Of course, not all modules work like this, so use the command shown here to execute whatever scripts are necessary for any other modules you install. Remember to change the username, as well as the file path, to reflect the specifics of your system and the module being installed.</p><p>With some contributions performing their own database modifications automatically, it is now easier to install a module, but it is also easier to<span class="emphasis"><em> shoot yourself in the foot</em></span>. This is because the changes take place behind the scenes without you having direct control over them. Admittedly, these changes, more often than not, are fairly harmless, but you never know.</p><p>To get things moving, we simply extract the contents of the download to the<code class="literal"> modules</code> folder. Once that is done, there is now a folder called<code class="literal"> taxonomy_access</code> in the<code class="literal"> modules</code> directory.</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"/>Note</h3><p>It is good practice to maintain separate folders for each additional contributed module in the<code class="literal"> modules</code> folder. Doing this allows you to keep track of which module files have been added, and which are the core files.</p></div></div><p>That's pretty much all there is to do behind the scenes, but we still need to ensure that we can make use of this module from the administrator's point of view.</p><p>Log in to your site as the administrator and head on over to the<span class="strong"><strong> modules</strong></span> section under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item. Scroll down the list of available modules and you should come across your new<span class="strong"><strong> taxonomy_access</strong></span> module, like so:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Installing Modules" src="graphics/1800_04_02.jpg"/></div><p>Enable the module and click<span class="strong"><strong> Save configuration</strong></span>. That's it, all done!</p><p>Naturally, we still need to test out the module and put it to work. It is used in the following chapter however, so we won't discuss it any further here. You should be confident that you can now select, download, and install any module you like. Let's move on and look at how to configure the standard modules that we enabled earlier.<a class="indexterm" id="id110"/>
</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Configuring Modules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec03"/>Configuring Modules</h1></div></div></div><p>Obviously, the nature of the setup for each module can differ wildly from the next. This is because modules can provide pretty much any type of functionality you can imagine, ranging from a simple poll, to a search engine, or whatever. Accordingly, there are a host of different settings associated with each one.</p><p>You should also bear in mind that because of the inherent broadness of function associated with modules, the configuration and use of each one can also vary greatly. What this means is that it can be quite confusing at first to find out where to go in order to change settings or simply make use of them.<a class="indexterm" id="id111"/>
</p><p>We will begin with<span class="strong"><strong> forum</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> locale</strong></span>, followed by the others, since these two are slightly more complex.</p><div class="section" title="Forum"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec03"/>Forum</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we begin looking at forums, you should ensure that you have enabled both the<span class="strong"><strong> comment</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> taxonomy</strong></span> modules since these are required in order for the<span class="strong"><strong> forum</strong></span> module to function (This will probably be done automatically). Once these are all enabled, you can go along to the<span class="strong"><strong> forums</strong></span> link under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item to begin working with it. You will be presented with the following page, which will straight away raise some interesting questions:<a class="indexterm" id="id112"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Forum" src="graphics/1800_04_03.jpg"/></div><p>"How<span class="emphasis"><em> do I go about organizing my forum(s)?"</em></span> is probably what you are asking right now. The answer to this really depends on how broad the scope of the discussion topics are going to be, how many people will be using the forums, and the nature of the topics up for discussion. What you are aiming for is an intuitive, logical, easy-to-use structure that will facilitate and encourage discussion by allowing users to easily find information—as opposed to frustrating them with a poor structure that effectively hides topics.</p><p>Let's take a look at how to go about organizing the demo site's forum.<span class="emphasis"><em> Where do we begin?</em></span> A good idea is to draw out your structure beforehand so that you can see how everything relates, and make changes before you begin creating or deleting forums. For example, it may seem logical to split up forums depending on location, so that people in the US go straight to the North American forums, and people in Africa go straight to the African forums.<a class="indexterm" id="id113"/>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this has several drawbacks because you would end up with a lot of repeated topics for each continent (since wildlife issues are the same the world over). Even worse, if you were living in the States and were concerned about canned hunting in South Africa, where would you go to discuss this, Africa or North America? It seems that partitioning your forums based on location, in this instance, is probably not a good idea.<span class="emphasis"><em> So what criteria do we use to categorize our forum content?</em></span>
</p><p>The best way to do it is by issue. People want to discuss issues or topics, and so they naturally look for content based on these criteria. When looked at in this light, the meaning of the<span class="strong"><strong> add containers</strong></span> tab becomes clear, because now we can organize forum topics based on their common issues.</p><p>For example, one of the major areas of concern for wildlife today is the topic of conservation. This in turn has many facets, all of which would no doubt be of interest to the demo site's target audience. The environment is also an issue that should be discussed, and everyone is interested in research these days. These all seem like viable containers because they logically encapsulate the bulk of what people using this site will discuss.<a class="indexterm" id="id114"/>
</p><p>Moving ahead on this line of thought, each of the potential containers has distinct sub-categories that users would intuitively understand as topics for debate—we'll see the actual structure I came up with in a moment. Once you have a nice structure jotted down on paper, it is time to actually implement the forums on the site. Let's set about this by creating the containers first. Click<span class="strong"><strong> add container</strong></span> to bring up a page that allows you to specify the name of the container, a brief description, the parent, and a weight.</p><p>Since you should have already decided on a structure, it is easy to see which container or forum has which parent. The top-level container or forum should obviously leave the parent as<span class="strong"><strong>&lt;root&gt;</strong></span>. You can set the weight of the container or forum if you would like them to be presented in an order other than alphabetical—the smaller the weight; the closer to the top of the pile it will appear.<a class="indexterm" id="id115"/>
</p><p>Keep adding containers and forums, along with helpful descriptions until you have completed the entire structure. The following screenshot shows how the demo site ended up (There are, no doubt, more topics that could be added or changed, but this suffices for the moment):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Forum" src="graphics/1800_04_04.jpg"/></div><p>There are a few things to note here. First of all, there is some overlap in terms of how categories mesh on a conceptual level. For example,<span class="strong"><strong> Global Warming</strong></span> should logically appear under<span class="strong"><strong> Environmental Impact</strong></span>, so<span class="emphasis"><em> why does it have its own forum?</em></span> The answer is that you need to think about which issues are likely to be most important. As global warming is a huge issue, it warrants a promotion to its own forum.</p><p>Secondly, I have only added a single parent layer of containers, with forums appearing under this. It is possible to add containers within containers and so on, but in the interests of making it easy to find topics, you should try keeping a flat structure instead of creating a deep navigation structure wherever possible. This is because it is easier for people to search a list than to navigate a deep hierarchy.<a class="indexterm" id="id116"/>
</p><p>Finally, there are some configuration options, which you should take a look over before finishing. Most of the defaults are pretty sensible, but you may wish to click the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> tab, and decide on such things as how many posts you want to consider<span class="emphasis"><em> hot</em></span>, or whether to order your posts by date or activity. Once you are done, click<span class="strong"><strong> Save configuration</strong></span> and your forum is more or less ready to go.<a class="indexterm" id="id117"/>
</p><p>Let's continue with setting up the other modules before we take a look at how to use one of them. In reality you should play around with each and every module, and ensure that it is working to your satisfaction, even though we don't have the space to do so here.</p></div><div class="section" title="Locale"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec04"/>Locale</h2></div></div></div><p>With<span class="strong"><strong> locale</strong></span> enabled, you can now click the<span class="strong"><strong> localization</strong></span> link under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> in order to take a look at what's on offer. Doing so will bring up the following page:<a class="indexterm" id="id118"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Locale" src="graphics/1800_04_05.jpg"/></div><p>Since there are many European agencies and organizations that deal with conservation and environmental issues, we would like to add, for example, Italian to our website. In order to do this, we simply click<span class="strong"><strong> add language</strong></span>, select the relevant language from the drop-down language list, and click the<span class="strong"><strong> Add language</strong></span> button below.<a class="indexterm" id="id119"/>
</p><p>The next step is to actually import the language onto the site so that the translation can be done. In order to achieve this, go and find the relevant language file from the Drupal<span class="strong"><strong> Translations</strong></span> page at<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/project/translations">http://drupal.org/project/translations</a>. Search around until you find the relevant file, and then download and unzip the file to your file system. Once that is done, click the<span class="strong"><strong> import</strong></span> tab and then browse to the<code class="literal"> .po</code> file from your Drupal page—you should have something like this (depending on the language being imported):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Locale" src="graphics/1800_04_06.jpg"/></div><p>Once you are happy that you have the right language<code class="literal"> .po</code> file and that you are importing it into the correct language, click<span class="strong"><strong> Import</strong></span>. From the previous screenshot you can tell that, sensibly enough, we are importing the<code class="literal"> it.po</code> file (the Italian language file) into the<span class="strong"><strong> Italian</strong></span> language on our site. Since this is a new import we don't need to worry about replacing any strings in the<span class="strong"><strong> Mode</strong></span> section. If you were modifying your language translations, then you might consider leaving what you have intact, and only adding new strings by selecting the second option.</p><p>When that is done, check the<span class="strong"><strong> Enabled</strong></span> checkbox on the page that is brought up and click<span class="strong"><strong> Save configuration</strong></span>. You now have a new language enabled on your site. You can repeat this process for whichever languages are available for download and are required by your users.<a class="indexterm" id="id120"/>
</p><p>The next thing we should discuss briefly is how to manage strings. You might find that an imported language translation doesn't translate everything as you'd like, in which case you need to do it manually. Click the<span class="strong"><strong> manage strings</strong></span> tab and you will see a search page that you can use to locate the string(s) you would like to change. There is also a list of options to control your search. Once you have found what you are looking for, you can simply edit it accordingly.</p><p>Bear in mind that it is possible to create a custom language file, and build up the list of translations for that by using the string management tool under the<span class="strong"><strong> manage strings</strong></span> tab and manually entering translations—although, this is rather tedious work.</p><p>If you get a set of translations fairly complete, or make improvements to a language file, then the community, in general, would certainly appreciate it if you used the<span class="strong"><strong> export</strong></span> link to share your translation files with everyone. Once you have exported the file in<code class="literal"> .po</code> format by selecting the language to export and clicking the<span class="strong"><strong> Export</strong></span> button, you can then set about getting it up on the Drupal site (take a look under the<span class="strong"><strong> Contribute</strong></span> tab on the Drupal site for more information).<a class="indexterm" id="id121"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Comments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec05"/>Comments</h2></div></div></div><p>Since this module is needed by default, along with the forum module, we may as well discuss it here briefly. A comment, as the name implies, allows users to remark about content they find on the site—simple as that. How to figure out who can comment and on what, is the subject of<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Users, Roles, and Permissions"> Chapter 5</a> on<span class="emphasis"><em> Users, Roles, and Permissions</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id122"/>
</p><p>You can find<span class="strong"><strong> comments</strong></span> under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item, and clicking this brings up a list of all the comments on your site. The following screenshot shows a typical comments page once a few comments have been added to a particular post:<a class="indexterm" id="id123"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Comments" src="graphics/1800_04_07.jpg"/></div><p>From this you can see that we have a comprehensive interface for working with comments. There are a few<span class="strong"><strong> Update options</strong></span> available, and these allow us to delete or unpublish comments. If you never wanted to see a comment again on your site, then<span class="strong"><strong> Delete the selected comments</strong></span> is the way to go. If you only want to prevent the comment from being displayed, without being removed entirely, then<span class="strong"><strong> Unpublish the selected comments</strong></span> is the correct update option to use.</p><p>Assuming you have decided to unpublish a comment for some reason or other, you will have to look for it under the<span class="strong"><strong> approval queue</strong></span> tab instead of the main page. The approval queue allows you to search through and edit posts that have landed up here for whatever reason—it may be that you have unpublished them, or it may be that you have decided to force all comments into the approval queue for moderation. However comments land up here, you will find that there are two update options available again, this time you can either delete the comment or publish it.</p><p>Clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> tab, you will find two important categories associated with comments, namely<span class="strong"><strong> Viewing options</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Posting settings</strong></span>. Browse through the available options and make any changes you would like. For example, in the<span class="strong"><strong> Viewing options</strong></span> section, the<span class="strong"><strong> Default display mode</strong></span> was changed to Threaded list collapsed in order to bunch related comments together without displaying the body for each comment. The Default display order was also changed to Date oldest first so that comments can be viewed as a conversation from the top of the page downwards.<a class="indexterm" id="id124"/>
</p><p>Using these settings, comments on a page now look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Comments" src="graphics/1800_04_08.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, earlier comments appear towards the top of the pile, with replies to those comments posted underneath and indented. Of course, this may not be to you liking, and these comments might just as easily been displayed like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Comments" src="graphics/1800_04_09.jpg"/></div><p>It shouldn't be too hard to work out what changes were made in order to get the comments looking like this (especially since they are shown in the previous screenshot), so it is left as an exercise for you to do. How you decide to display comments is really up to you, and any decisions made should take into account how comments are used on the site.</p><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Posting settings</strong></span> section provides a few options on how users actually create their comments. Once again, you should really take into account the type of site you are working on. For example, it might seem sensible to force users to preview their comments, but if you find that you have a bunch of regular community users who post very frequently, then it is going to become tedious for them to continue checking their posts every time.<a class="indexterm" id="id125"/>
</p><p>Assuming you are going to allow anonymous users to post comments, you must decide whether they are to leave contact information with their posts. From the point of view of keeping up the standard of posts to your site, it is probably a good idea to have postings from anonymous viewers sent to the approval queue so that you don't become a victim of spam attacks or cheap advertising. This can be done in the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> section under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> by selecting only the<span class="strong"><strong> post comments</strong></span> option in the<span class="strong"><strong> comment module</strong></span> section for anonymous users, as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id126"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Comments" src="graphics/1800_04_10.jpg"/></div><p>As with anything, this is a trade-off because you are really giving yourself a lot of work by insisting that all comments from anonymous users are moderated. You might find that in the long run it is better to insist that people who wish to become active community members are registered.</p></div><div class="section" title="Content Types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec06"/>Content Types</h2></div></div></div><p>Some of you might be frowning at the moment, because aren't comments content types? Well, yes, they are, but their configuration is slightly different from the others, so they have been separated out. The three content type modules, which we enabled in the previous section, have similar configuration settings to contend with, so it makes sense to cover them altogether here. If you navigate back to the<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span> section under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> and then click<span class="strong"><strong> content types</strong></span>, you will be shown a list of all the available types, like this, depending on what you have enabled:<a class="indexterm" id="id127"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Content Types" src="graphics/1800_04_11.jpg"/></div><p>Clicking<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> brings up the relevant configuration page, and since they are all the same we will only look at one in detail here. For interest's sake, we will open up the poll configuration page.</p><p>The options on this configuration page are broken up into two sections: the first allowing you to enter some explanatory text and select the minimum number of words required to make the content type valid; the second section,<span class="strong"><strong> Workflow</strong></span>, is shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Content Types" src="graphics/1800_04_12.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, comments, as well as attachments, have been disabled because we don't really want feedback on the poll posting itself and we aren't bothered about attaching files to polls—they should simply be straightforward Q&amp;A tools. You will need to make choices like this for each and every one of the content types based on how you want the content to be utilized.<a class="indexterm" id="id128"/>
</p><p>You can also decide whether certain content postings should remain at the top of lists as well as deal with a couple of slightly more complex options like<span class="strong"><strong> Create new revision</strong></span> or<span class="strong"><strong> In moderation queue</strong></span>—these will be discussed later on in<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Basic Content"> Chapter 6</a> on Basic Content. For now, you might find it better to leave these settings as they and come back to them later once you have all the necessary information.</p></div><div class="section" title="Search"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec07"/>Search</h2></div></div></div><p>This is an interesting module to configure because there are some subtle underlying issues, which you should take into consideration when adjusting the settings. For a start, the indexing process that is used to build the search in the database relies on cron (discussed in<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Running Your Website"> Chapter 10</a>). You will need to ensure that you have this operating correctly on your live site if you are going to implement a search feature. For more information on cron jobs and the<code class="literal"> cron.php</code> script provided with Drupal, you can also visit<span class="strong"><strong> system</strong></span> in the<span class="strong"><strong> help</strong></span> section under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item.<a class="indexterm" id="id129"/>
</p><p>It is possible to re-index your site manually by clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> Re-index site</strong></span> button at the top of the search page, under the<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span> menu item. This will cause Drupal to go over the site's content and update its index so that any new content that you specifically wish to be included in any searches will be.</p><p>Most of the other settings in this section relate to the performance of the system. For example, as the number of items you choose to index per cron run will also affect the speed of the cron job, you might have to make this setting a little lower if you are running into time-out problems. As well as this, indexing shorter words adds load to your system, because it has to index that many more words in the content.</p><p>Finally, it is possible to decide on how to weigh the site search based on three criteria, namely<span class="strong"><strong> Keyword relevance, Recently posted</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Number of comments</strong></span>. You need to work out which criterion is more important, and which one can be safely downgraded in importance. In the case of the demo site, the following settings were used:<a class="indexterm" id="id130"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Search" src="graphics/1800_04_13.jpg"/></div><p>The reason for the weightings given here is because we really want searches to hinge on whether there is a strong correlation between the search terms and the content. Effectively, we are saying that just because a posting is new, doesn't make it more worthwhile, and just because a piece of content has been commented on extensively, doesn't make it more relevant. Depending on your criteria, you may choose something completely different—the bottom line is to ensure that the search results are as relevant as possible to the site's users.</p></div><div class="section" title="Upload"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec08"/>Upload</h2></div></div></div><p>Assuming you are going to allow file uploads to the site, then there are a few settings that are of interest. Click the<span class="strong"><strong> upload</strong></span> option under<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span> in<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> to bring up the configuration page for uploads. Here you will be able to determine the<span class="strong"><strong> Maximum resolution for uploaded images</strong></span>, as well as whether to<span class="strong"><strong> List files by default</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id131"/>
</p><p>Depending on which version of Drupal you have, it may also be possible to decide what types of files are to be allowed onto the site. Remember that some files can contain harmful or malicious code like spyware, viruses, or Trojans. You probably don't want to run the risk of spreading them around by allowing<code class="literal"> .exe</code> or other executable files to be made available. Further, you need to think about how much disk space there is available. The last thing you want to do is allow people to upload entire movie files that can take up gigabytes of space at a time; so ensure that the<span class="strong"><strong> Maximum file size</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Total file size per user</strong></span> are kept down to a reasonable limit.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Menus and Primary Links"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec04"/>Menus and Primary Links</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we continue with something new, it is very important to take a look at the site and see whether the changes made so far have the desired effect. Remember: it is of paramount importance that new modifications are always tested out like this.<span class="emphasis"><em> How do we go about testing out the new modules?</em></span> The best way is really to try to use them on the site; so navigate to the homepage and take a look at the site as it stands. At present we have something like this (provided you are logged in as the administrator):<a class="indexterm" id="id132"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_14.jpg"/></div><p>This is certainly not what we would hope for. For a start, there is no immediate way to navigate over to the forums, or even look at a poll. We have enabled these modules and even configured them;<span class="emphasis"><em> so why aren't they showing up on the site?</em></span> The answer lies in the fact that we haven't yet edited our menus or configured the primary links.</p><p>You will probably have noticed the<span class="strong"><strong> primary links</strong></span> link in the top-right corner of your screen already. Go ahead and click it to get the ball rolling. The following screenshot shows a part of the list that is pulled up on the new page:<a class="indexterm" id="id133"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_15.jpg"/></div><p>The highlighted sections in the screenshot above tell us which menu items are disabled. By default all the new modules that we have enabled, such as<span class="strong"><strong> forums, blogs</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> search</strong></span> are not available in the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu item</strong></span> list. Let's rectify this by enabling<span class="strong"><strong> forums</strong></span> (or all of them if you wish). You will notice that you have a few options to contend with for each one before they are enabled. You can make some fairly common-sense decisions regarding these, and the following screenshot shows how the<span class="strong"><strong> forums</strong></span> menu item has been set up:<a class="indexterm" id="id134"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_16.jpg"/></div><p>Select<span class="strong"><strong> Parent item</strong></span> carefully, as you may not always want a menu item to be displayed on the top level. For example, there is a<span class="strong"><strong> Search</strong></span> box present at the top-right of the screen (for now), so you might not want the<span class="strong"><strong> search</strong></span> menu item to appear alongside the other main menu items as this would be fairly redundant.<a class="indexterm" id="id135"/>
</p><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Path</strong></span> option allows you to check that this menu item points to the correct content, allowing you to click on the link below (in this case,<span class="strong"><strong> forum)</strong></span> to see which page is brought up. This is useful if the menu item has been manually added and you are uncertain as to whether the target URL for the item was correctly entered.</p><p>Once you are done, you will find that the items you have enabled are now available in the menu on the left-hand side.</p><p>It is possible that you will need to create your own menu at some stage—perhaps to provide a more focused navigable area. In such a case, use the<span class="strong"><strong> add menu</strong></span> tab on the<span class="strong"><strong> menus</strong></span> page to enter the name of a new menu, like so:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_17.jpg"/></div><p>After submitting this, it is then easy to add new menu items using the<span class="strong"><strong> add menu item</strong></span> tab:<a class="indexterm" id="id136"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_18.jpg"/></div><p>From the screenshot above, you can see that we are adding a menu item entitled<span class="strong"><strong> aggregation</strong></span> to the<span class="strong"><strong> News</strong></span> parent item. The<span class="strong"><strong> Path</strong></span> we have chosen to link the menu item to is<span class="strong"><strong> aggregator</strong></span>, as this will display all the aggregated news available on the site (assuming this is set up). If you don't have<span class="strong"><strong> aggregator</strong></span> enabled for now, link it to something else—anything will do! Once this is done, you can view the new menu at the bottom of the menu page:<a class="indexterm" id="id137"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_19.jpg"/></div><p>If you would like to have this menu displayed somewhere on your site, then it is a simple matter of enabling it in the<span class="strong"><strong> blocks</strong></span> section of the main menu under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span>. Blocks are discussed in detail later in this chapter under the section entitled Working with Blocks, so we won't go any further with this particular topic other than to show you this (the result of adding the<span class="strong"><strong> News</strong></span> menu, with its<span class="strong"><strong> aggregator</strong></span> menu item to the left sidebar):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_20.jpg"/></div><p>With that out of the way, we need to look at how to configure the primary links, which appear by default at the top right-hand side of each page. We have already clicked on this link in order to bring up the<span class="strong"><strong> menu</strong></span> section that we used in this section, but we have not yet taken a look at what configuration options we have available for the primary links.</p><p>Head on over to the<span class="strong"><strong> menus</strong></span> link that appears under the<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span> menu item in the main menu. You will notice that the page is divided into two halves. The first provides a drop-down list for the menu options associated with both primary and secondary links as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id138"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_21.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, the fact that the latest addition to the available menus,<span class="strong"><strong> News</strong></span>, is present in this list should give you a clue as to how this page is used. In actual fact, we can select whatever menu item we wish to display here. In this case,<span class="strong"><strong> Navigation</strong></span> is the menu of choice, and after saving these settings, the<span class="strong"><strong> Navigation</strong></span> menu items are displayed along the top of each page, like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_22.jpg"/></div><p>Now, recall that we enabled the<span class="strong"><strong> forums</strong></span> menu item within the<span class="strong"><strong> Navigation</strong></span> menu a little earlier in this section, so it appears along with all the other primary links in this menu item. Drupal doesn't stop there, because right below the first drop-down list, we have a second one that can be used to display secondary links.</p><p>Selecting<span class="strong"><strong> Navigation</strong></span>, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_23.jpg"/></div><p>causes all the secondary links in the given menu item to be displayed. In this case, the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> primary link has a large number of secondary links associated with it; so the header section now looks a bit crowded:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Menus and Primary Links" src="graphics/1800_04_24.jpg"/></div><p>Having the ability to create whatever menus you like and then display them wherever you want is a very powerful tool. There are a multitude of different combinations for you to try out. For example, you might wish to create a content menu that contains a listing of all the different types of content on your site—blogs, forums, stories, polls, and so on. You can then attach this menu to the primary links as a kind of<span class="emphasis"><em> quick navigation</em></span> tool for users. Very powerful and very flexible; I'm sure you'll agree!<a class="indexterm" id="id139"/>
</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Using Modules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec05"/>Using Modules</h1></div></div></div><p>So now we have a whole bunch of configured modules just waiting to be used. The content-related modules should be present in the main menu (or at least<span class="strong"><strong> forums)</strong></span> because we have edited the primary links to allow them to be shown (alternatively, you might have created your own menu to allow navigation of content). We still need to take a quick look at one of the modules here just to prove that everything is in order. One of the more powerful examples of how customizable Drupal is can be demonstrated quite nicely with the<span class="strong"><strong> locale</strong></span> module, so let's look at that.<a class="indexterm" id="id140"/>
</p><p>Assuming you are a registered user, and the site is configured to allow for localization (by having several languages enabled in the<span class="strong"><strong> localization</strong></span> page under<span class="strong"><strong> administer)</strong></span>, you could simply log on, click the<span class="strong"><strong> my account</strong></span> link, and then select the<span class="strong"><strong> edit</strong></span> tab on that page. Scrolling down, the option to select the interface's language as shown here is now available:<a class="indexterm" id="id141"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Using Modules" src="graphics/1800_04_25.jpg"/></div><p>After making a language selection, in this case<span class="strong"><strong> Italian</strong></span>, click<span class="strong"><strong> Submit</strong></span> at the bottom of the page, and you will find that, depending on how well the translation has been done, your site is more or less presented in the language of your choice. Now, whenever you log out the site goes back to its default language, in this instance<span class="strong"><strong> English</strong></span>, but on login the site is re-rendered in<span class="strong"><strong> Italian</strong></span>, like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Using Modules" src="graphics/1800_04_26.jpg"/></div><p>This is a fairly impressive and powerful feature of Drupal, and hopefully, regardless of whether you need this particular module, you are getting excited about the many possibilities that lie ahead.</p><p>It is strongly recommended that you now work with all the modules you have enabled before continuing, and get a feel for what is happening behind the scenes. One question you will ask yourself sooner or later is<span class="emphasis"><em> How do I go about presenting all my modules on the site?</em></span> This is obviously a fairly important question; so we will deal with it right now…<a class="indexterm" id="id142"/>
</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Working with Blocks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec06"/>Working with Blocks</h1></div></div></div><p>As we saw briefly in<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Setting Up the Development Environment"> Chapter 2</a>, blocks contain information or related data that is visible in various places around the site—depending on where you choose to show them. Blocks are often generated by modules, but it is also possible to create them manually. Since many modules generate blocks automatically, it is always wise to pay the<span class="strong"><strong> blocks</strong></span> section a visit whenever a new module has been enabled, because chances are that you have some new settings to play with.<a class="indexterm" id="id143"/>
</p><p>OK, we know what blocks are, so<span class="emphasis"><em> what are we discussing in this section?</em></span> Well, when we talk about working with blocks, what we are really saying is<span class="emphasis"><em>"How do we want to present the functionality of the site to the user?"</em></span> Naturally, everyone should strive to make a striking and unique site, and layout configuration is a big part of that—especially since it governs how functionality is organized on the site's interface.</p><p>Keep in mind at all times that the overriding factors, which govern the way you set things up when it comes to presenting the site, are all about usability. Make sure that the site is intuitive and easy to follow and never sacrifice clarity and ease of use for artistic reasons.<a class="indexterm" id="id144"/>
</p><p>Luckily, Drupal is already fairly sensibly laid out by default, but that doesn't mean that there is not plenty to do. You have an exceptional amount of control over where and how everything is displayed and correspondingly, quite a lot to work on.</p><p>For the moment, we are only concerned with where functionality is going to be presented on the page. In other words, we are dealing with the part of the interface design that is directly concerned with the site's functionality. For example, a theme would work with such things as color and font, or even background images and layout, among other things (the scope of themes is actually very broad but for the time being it is fine to look at things in this way), whereas we would still need to enable and add blocks to certain parts of the site regardless of what template/theme we were using.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>But where do we begin?</em></span> Well, one of the best ways to find out how you want things done is by looking on the Net and seeing how other people have made sites that work nicely. If there is something you like, see if it can be imitated on your site.</p><p>Another way to learn about how you are ultimately going to set out your site is to actually play around and see what works. This section will concentrate on this method and leave the first method for you to research.</p><div class="section" title="Adding Blocks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec09"/>Adding Blocks</h2></div></div></div><p>Under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item, click<span class="strong"><strong> blocks</strong></span> to bring up the list of blocks that are available for the site at present. Remember that as you add and change things on your site, this list will change—you will probably have to revisit it more than once. Looking over the blocks page, you will see a list of the available blocks and several options for each one. Drupal gives you the ability to place any of these options pretty much anywhere on the page, but your choices shouldn't be quite so random.<a class="indexterm" id="id145"/>
</p><p>Try to make the site intuitive to use. In order to do this, it is a good idea to group related information into the same places on the site, so that users can get a feel for where they might look for a specific type of content. For the purposes of the demo site, the following settings were made for the time being (remember that as the site develops, it is likely that this will change):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Adding Blocks" src="graphics/1800_04_27.jpg"/></div><p>There is one interesting point to note about the<span class="strong"><strong> Weight</strong></span> settings. If you look at the previous screenshot, you will see that the blocks in the<span class="strong"><strong> right sidebar</strong></span> have weightings of<span class="strong"><strong> 1</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> 4</strong></span>. What do I do if I want to add two new blocks above these? Fortunately, the<span class="strong"><strong> Weight</strong></span> drop-down list (under<span class="strong"><strong> blocks)</strong></span> has negative numbers that allow you to give weightings of less than<span class="strong"><strong> 0</strong></span> so that you don't have to redo all the weightings to insert one above. Accordingly, if you wanted to add two more blocks to the top of the right sidebar, you could give them weights of<span class="strong"><strong> 1</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> 0</strong></span> without changing anything else.<a class="indexterm" id="id146"/>
</p><p>Moving on, notice that information about other users, like<span class="strong"><strong> Who's new</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Who's online</strong></span>, is confined to the footer area of the page in the previous screenshot. This is because obviously the main area of concern for the site is not who is online, but rather content relating to wildlife. This information is therefore assigned to the bottom of the page where people who are interested in taking a look at who's around can take the trouble to check, without it detracting from the main content of the site. It's a good idea to put all information like this at the bottom of your pages.</p><p>What else? All content-related issues are grouped into the right-hand sidebar. This means that if people want to quickly take a look at what new content has been added to the site, they can find it by looking here. As well as this, information is structured such that polls appear above all other information (because we generally want to encourage people to take the time to answer a poll), but we have left the search form at the top of the page, because we envisage this to be the most useful tool once the amount of content on the site has become substantial.</p><p>Of course, some blocks remain disabled as the site does not need them for now. It is always easy to add or remove blocks at a later date. Provided you make sure there is a nice logical layout for the various blocks, you can chop and change what is and is not displayed as and when required. But try not to chop and change too often as this will hurt the usability of the site and may lead to frustration among users once it has gone live.</p><p>Taking a look at your homepage once these changes have been saved (by clicking<span class="strong"><strong> Save blocks)</strong></span>, you will see that the various blocks have been inserted into your web pages as you requested. It's easy enough to move things around until you are totally happy with the way the page looks.</p><p>Some of you may also have noticed that there is an<span class="strong"><strong> add block</strong></span> tab at the top of the<span class="strong"><strong> blocks</strong></span> page. Clicking this brings up a page that can be used to insert your own blocks into your site, as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id147"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Adding Blocks" src="graphics/1800_04_28.jpg"/></div><p>In this case, we are adding a little block of PHP code that takes a quote out of a file from the<code class="literal"> drupal</code> folder in the file system (quotes.txt), breaks it up into an array of lines, picks one at random, and then displays it in a special font. Don't worry about understanding the PHP code for the moment. This is really just here to give you an idea of why you might wish to add a block to the site in future. If you then view the new block on the website you should get something like this (depending on what quotes you have added to your<code class="literal"> quote.txt</code> file):<a class="indexterm" id="id148"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Adding Blocks" src="graphics/1800_04_29.jpg"/></div><p>Adding silly quotes is of course something quite fun to do, but hopefully you appreciate how easy it is to include new blocks in your pages. The situation becomes more complex when we start thinking about whether certain people should be allowed to access a block or not, or whether the block should be displayed on all pages or only on selected pages. In order to find out how to deal with these issues, we must look at block configuration in some detail.</p></div><div class="section" title="Configuring Blocks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec10"/>Configuring Blocks</h2></div></div></div><p>Drupal allows us to control when a block is displayed through the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> link at the right-hand side of each block in the list. This configuration page is split up into three sections that deal with:<a class="indexterm" id="id149"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Block specific settings</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>User specific visibility settings</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Page specific visibility settings</strong></span></li></ul></div><p>Combining these three sections provides a sophisticated method of controlling when a block is shown, and to whom. Of course, some modules don't require any specific settings of their own; so you might find that you are only required to make specific decisions about users and pages more often than not.</p><p>A good example for configuring a block can be shown by the<span class="strong"><strong> Who's online</strong></span> page. This page allows us to decide how long users can be inactive, before we no longer consider them online, as well as, the maximum number of people to show at any one time. That's easy enough to deal with, and really depends on the needs of the site. The next two options give us something to think about though:<a class="indexterm" id="id150"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Blocks" src="graphics/1800_04_31.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, the settings above allow users to edit their own preference for whether they can see the<span class="strong"><strong> Who's online</strong></span> block—although, it is visible by default. While you might find that most of your casual users don't really mind, regular users often appreciate being given some control over how they set up their pages.</p><p>With these settings in place, users editing their account information are presented with the following checkbox that allows them to enable the block or leave it disabled:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Blocks" src="graphics/1800_04_30.jpg"/></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Allowing users to make their own choices is one thing, but what if we don't want to display a certain block on a certain page ever?</em></span> Well, the next section allows us to do exactly this, and if you look at the screenshot before last, you will see that the<span class="strong"><strong> Show on every page except the listed pages</strong></span> option has been selected and the text<span class="strong"><strong>&lt;front&gt;</strong></span> has been entered in the<span class="strong"><strong> Pages</strong></span> text area. This means that whenever someone visits the site, they aren't shown who is online. This information only becomes available once they have logged in or begun using the site by looking over content or adding material.</p><p>More advanced users can add some code to determine whether or not the block is displayed. This could be in the form:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">if (some_condition_is_true){
return TRUE;
}else{
return FALSE;
}
</pre></div><p>You will probably find that you only need to come back to this section later on, when there are specific reasons to show or not show information. As always, it is recommended that you play around and attempt to show a module on a certain page but not others.<span class="emphasis"><em> For example, can you show a block only when someone is using the forums?</em></span> The answer is of course to select<span class="strong"><strong> Show on only the listed pages</strong></span> option, and then enter<span class="strong"><strong> forum</strong></span> or<span class="strong"><strong> forum/*</strong></span> into the text area. Make sure this is correct by trying it out on your own machine.<a class="indexterm" id="id151"/>
</p><p>Now you know how to configure a block. It is simply a case of going through each one you have enabled, and making the appropriate decisions about when, where, and to whom they will be displayed.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec07"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>With the general configuration tasks out of the way, we knuckled down to the all important topic of adding functionality and organizing it on the site. This is one of the most important tasks you will undertake during the development phase. Selecting and implementing the right functionality is a subtle task, but hopefully you found that Drupal makes it quite easy to implement once you have made up your mind about what goes where.</p><p>As well as this, we got a taste of what it's like to have an entire development community to draw from, when we downloaded and installed a contribution module. Contribution modules are an invaluable resource for extending the functionality of a site. This valuable facility comes with the express warning that you need to safeguard the security of your site by making backups before implementing any changes.</p><p>Drupal's power and elegance shone through brightly when we talked about how easy it is to customize the site's menu and navigation. Having a powerful tool, combined with the flexibility of the menu system, is an extraordinary help when it comes to creating a well designed and easy‑to‑use site. Hopefully, the relationship between how menus are created and how they relate to the functionality provided by the modules became clear to you over the course of the latter stages of the chapter.</p><p>One of the most important things you hopefully learned from this chapter is that, because Drupal is so flexible and customizable, there are a large number of settings that are held at different places. Keeping track of all of these might seem quite daunting at first, but you will become more familiar with them as you work with Drupal. Eventually, you will be able to find your way around with ease.</p><p>For now though, sit back and take a quick break, happy in the knowledge of a task well done. In the following chapter we will begin looking at how to work with users and permissions—another topic crucial for your success as a Drupal administrator.</p></div></body></html>
