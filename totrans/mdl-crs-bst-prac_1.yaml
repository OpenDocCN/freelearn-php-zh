    you have? You've come to the right place. We want to help you take full advantage
    of all that Moodle has to offer, while creating more engaging and user-friendly
    experiences for your learners. At the same time, we want to make sure that you're
    not working harder than you need to be. We'll help you avoid doing things the
    hard way and focus your efforts so you're spending time where it will have the
    most impact.

    which is the default for **Moodle 3.5**. If you're using MoodleCloud, you'll probably
    using the Moodlecloud theme, which is very different. It's more related to the Clean
    theme of Moodle 3.x and beyond. So, a word of warning. The Moodlecloud theme is
    very different from Boost, and if you're seeking guidance with Clean, you may
    be frustrated. The capabilities are the same, but the appearance is very different.

- en: We'll start with the question, "Why Moodle?" What does it have to offer course
    designers, trainers, and educators? First and foremost, as educators ourselves,
    we can say that the fact that Moodle is built around an instructional ideal or
    educational philosophy makes it pretty exceptional. More specifically, Moodle's
    design is driven by a social constructionist pedagogy as inspired by educational
    theorists such as Vygotsky, Papert, and others. Social constructionism is a view
    of education that relies on the belief that people create knowledge through the
    process of constructing artifacts, including text, media, or other such projects,
    within a social environment. In short, this means that the creator of Moodle,
    Martin Dougiamas, built Moodle based on the idea that people learn best when they
    have an opportunity to construct, share, collaborate, and learn with others. As
    we discuss Moodle's features, we'll see many ways in which this philosophy is
    exhibited.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In today's world of distributed communication, where people connect with each
    other through their mobile devices and use social media to communicate and collaborate,
    the original Moodle foundation of social constructionism makes more sense than
    ever.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'We could even go as far as to say that in our social media world, meaning and
    reality are often suspended until they are validated by the social media presence.
    It is no longer a rather hypothetical process that results in the social construction
    of reality, but a more direct statement: the thing does not exist until it is
    validated by our group (on social media). This may seem a bit harsh, but that
    is the way we have directed our technology to take us, and although we claim to
    live in a world that values individualism, we do not trust it when it comes to
    education, community, or enterprise. So, Moodle is again absolutely perfect for
    our world at this time.'

- en: Despite a strong pedagogical foundation, Moodle doesn't lock you into one way
    of teaching, which is another advantage of Moodle. It offers an array of choices
    when it comes to how you construct and deliver your course. In fact, we use this
    flexibility as the foundation for how this book is organized, with chapters devoted
    to a few of the more common ways that Moodle is used. Some are heavily reliant
    on social constructionist strategies, and others, less so. If you want to create
    a self-paced, content-driven course, Moodle can do that. If you need to facilitate
    a cohort-based, student-centered course, Moodle can do that too. Likewise, if
    you want to offer a very structured, linear course or, at the opposite end of
    the spectrum, manage a community, we think you'll find Moodle to be accommodating.

    (at a minimum). In this role, you'll have the ability to add and edit activities
    and resources so you can experiment with the ideas presented. Having site administrator
    permissions is helpful, but not required.
  prefs: []

    privileges, then you have several options. We can't describe every option in detail,
    but we can guide you towards the resources to assist you in filling in the gaps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first option is to outsource the setup and hosting of your Moodle site.
    If you don't have experience setting up and managing web servers but need your
    Moodle site to be available on the web, then this choice is probably the best
    for you. The Moodle Docs website offers a comprehensive discussion related to
    selecting hosting services at [http://docs.moodle.org/en/Finding_and_Selecting_A_Web_Host](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Finding_and_Selecting_A_Web_Host).
    The best choice for you, as this page outlines, will depend on your level of experience
    in managing servers and with Moodle or other learning management systems. It's
    also necessary to weigh factors such as cost and the level of Moodle support you
    prefer. We recommend seeking out a Moodle Partner, as they are certified service
    providers with a high level of expertise and experience. In addition, each Moodle
    Partner contributes a percentage of their revenue to Moodle HQ that, in turn,
    is used to compensate the developers who bring Moodle to life.

- en: 'The second option is to choose a cloud-based option, MoodleCloud, which is
    a very easy-to-use hosting option that was built by the people who developed Moodle.
    MoodleCloud is great if you''re just getting started because you can have up to
    50 participants (teachers and students), and you can set up as many individual
    courses as you''d like. It''s a great "sandbox" where you can explore Moodle''s
    wide array of resources and activities, and you can experiment with different
    patterns. You have up to 200 MB of storage, 50 users, and can have up to 10 webinar
    participants using BigBlueButton. The following screenshot shows you the menu
    you''ll see as you sign up at the MoodleCloud website at [https://moodlecloud.com](https://moodlecloud.com):'

    or on a hosted platform. For complete instructions, Moodle Docs again has a great
    resource that can be found on the Installing Moodle page at [http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are advantages and disadvantages to setting up and managing a site on
    your own, but doing so is a good fit for some. For example, the out-of-pocket
    cost will generally be less if you set up and manage your own site, but you may
    spend more time seeking out solutions on your own. You'll also likely have more
    freedom and flexibility when it comes to installing plugins or making code modifications,
    but even though it is a nice feature, you run the risk of doing it incorrectly.
    Another disadvantage of setting up and managing a site on your own is that you
    may be constrained by size. If your organization has a large number of courses,
    with a large number of users, it may be too time consuming to try to do everything
    on your own. Moodle updates and upgrades quite often, and plugins are also changed
    regularly. It is time-consuming enough to manage your courses and users without
    having to worry about Moodle updates and plugin upgrades.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're just looking to experiment with Moodle and don't need to make your
    site available to others, you might like the local install option. With the local
    installation, you basically set up a Moodle server on your personal computer.
    The advantage of this option is that you have a fully functioning Moodle site
    that you have complete control over. Furthermore, it's easy to set up and there's
    little risk of butchering your entire organization's courses and losing data if
    you wish to experiment. Further, if at some point you like what you've created,
    you can transfer individual courses or the site as a whole to a site hosted on
    the web.
  prefs: []

    publicly available, it'll be more difficult to share what you've done or involve

    and the Mac version can be found at [http://download.moodle.org/macosx/](http://download.moodle.org/macosx/).
    Regardless of which platform you use, you'll want to install the most recent stable
    version (that is, `MOODLE_35_STABLE`). The development version can be fun, but
    you're more likely to encounter bugs. The Linux version can be found at [https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Installing_Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Installing_Moodle)

    options available. These often restrict you to a single course or limit administrator
    permissions, but can be a fine choice for someone who is getting started. Though
    in most cases you'll have less control than afforded by a local installation,
    these options do offer the advantage of allowing you to make your course available
    to others.

    Guide` and wish to refer your students to that guide in a forum post. Without
    auto-linking enabled, you will need to copy the link to the guide to include it
    in your post. With auto-linking, however, as long as you type the name of the
    file or activity exactly as it's named in the course, Moodle will automatically

    Moodle course. We first reviewed options and resources for setting up your Moodle
    site. Then, we created user accounts and a course to use for the activities in
    the coming chapters. Last but not least, we changed a few important settings in
    the Site administration menu to provide additional functionality for our courses.

    instructional design concepts that will guide you through planning the structure
    of your course. In doing so, you will learn how to align the course design with
    your overall learning objectives. We'll also consider the kinds of assessments
    you will administer in order to evaluate whether or not the learning goals have
    been met.
