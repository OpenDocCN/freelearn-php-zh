    courses, it is time to take a look at how groups of people can come together as
    an online community and use Moodle to achieve their goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, individuals who have the same interests and want to discuss and
    share information in order to transfer knowledge can do so very easily in a Moodle
    course that has been set up for that purpose.

- en: There are many practical uses of Moodle for online communities. For example,
    members of an association or employees of a company can come together to achieve
    a goal and finish a task. In this case, Moodle provides the perfect place to interact,
    collaborate, and create a final project or achieve a task.

    can be a perfect vehicle for encouraging online communities to support each other
    to learn, take assessments, and display their certificates and badges. Moodle
    is also a good platform for a **Massive Open Online Course** (**MOOC**).

    flexible Moodle courses that are ideal for online communities and that can be
    modified easily to create opportunities to harness the power of individuals in
    many different locations to teach and learn new knowledge and skills.

- en: It is often easy to think of Moodle as a learning management system that is
    used primarily by organizations for their students or employees. The community
    tends to be well defined as it usually consists of students pursuing a common
    end, employees of a company, or members of an association or society.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there are many informal groups and communities that come together because
    they share interests, the desire to gain knowledge and skills, the need to work
    together to accomplish tasks, and the desire to let people know that they've reached
    milestones and acquired marketable abilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, an online community may form around the topic of climate change.
    The group, which may use social media to communicate with each other, would like
    to share information and get in touch with like-minded individuals. In this case,
    they have created a community of interest. While it's true that they can connect
    via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms, they may lack a platform
    that provides a "one-stop shopping" solution. Moodle makes it easy to share documents,
    videos, maps, graphics, audio files, and presentations. It also allows the users
    to interact with each other via discussion forums. Because we can use but not
    control social networks, it's important to be mindful of security issues. For
    that reason, Moodle administrators may wish to consider ways to back up or duplicate
    key posts or insights within the Moodle installation that can be preserved and
    stored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For administrators who are willing to incorporate social media, using Moodle
    as a place to bring together Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other
    platforms can make it extremely efficient for sharing and broadcasting the information
    your group wants to share with the world.

    task. For example, a group of volunteers may come together to organize a 5 km
    run fundraiser for epilepsy awareness. For such a case, Moodle has an array of
    activities and resources that can make it possible to collaborate in the planning
    and publicity of the event and even in the creation of post-event summary reports
    and press releases. You can even incorporate online booking platforms such as
    Eventbrite ([https://www.eventbrite.com/](https://www.eventbrite.com/)), which
    has a free version for free events and is perfect for publicizing free meet-ups
    and get-togethers. For fund-raising, Eventbrite will charge a fee (if you still
    use the free version):'

    know the kinds of skills they possess. They can display the certificates they've
    earned by completing online courses as well as their badges, digital certificates,
    mentions in high achievers lists, and other gamified evidence of achievements.
    There are also the MOOCs, which bring together instructional materials, guided
    group discussions, and automated assessments. With its features and flexibility,
    Moodle is a perfect platform for MOOCs.
