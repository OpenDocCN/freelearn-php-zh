    if you don't have your profile on at least a couple of the most popular social
    networks, then you might as well not exist at all, right? Well, no matter if you
    agree with this or not, it certainly rings true for your website. In other words,
    if you hope to attract any kind of audience and somehow convince them to keep
    coming back to your website, you absolutely have to (*have to!*) integrate it
    with social media.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, WordPress lets you do this in a more or less easy-to-grasp way. Even
    though social media integration is not a built-in feature per se, it can still
    be enabled via different plugins or other mechanisms. In this chapter, you will
    learn all about these features. We'll cover things such as how to enable simple
    social media share buttons on your website, how to work with social media APIs
    and integrations, and how to publish your blog content to social media automatically.

    website owners is an important element of their online presence), and a relatively
    new topic in the WordPress realm—**HTTPS** (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure**),
    which is all about making your website more secure by adding an additional level
    of encryption to the browser-website communication. An important thing worth pointing
    out here is that Google now expects all websites to have HTTPS encryption enabled.
    If your website fails to comply, Google might decide to lower your search engine
    rankings, and thus make your website less visible compared to your competition.

    friendly, as well as understand why you'd want to do this in the first place.

    main drivers of traffic for many websites. Even if you just want to share your

    your website, you need to have at least some level of social media integration.

    are hundreds of social media plugins available out there that allow you to display
    a basic set of social media buttons on your website. The one we advise you to
    use is called **Simple Social Media Share Buttons** (this plugin is available
    at [https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-social-buttons/)).
    Its main advantage is that it allows you to display buttons for all of the most
    popular social media networks, and you can also choose where and how you want
    these buttons displayed.

    of Twitter. What exactly Twitter's API is and how it works isn't very relevant

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Podcasting has become very popular in the last couple of years. Right now, there
    are thousands of podcasts available on the web, touching upon any topic or niche
    imaginable. Basically, a podcast is like a radio show or program, but run on entirely
    the internet. Under the hood, however, a podcast is just an audio recording. It
    can be episodic or serial, depending on your preference and the way you want to
    make it. The main idea with podcasts is that people can subscribe to them and
    they are notified whenever a new episode becomes available. Basically, your subscribers,
    instead of reading your posts on their computers, can listen to your content through
    their headphones at any time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adding a podcast to your WordPress blog is quite easy. From a technical point
    of view, the *subscription* mechanism of a podcast is handled by **Really Simple
    Syndication** (**RSS**) feeds. RSS is a web technology that allows you to deliver
    (or consume) content structured in an XML format. RSS feeds are usually organized
    with the most recent information at the top. The way WordPress works with RSS
    feeds by default, is that it enables feeds for your most recent posts, as well
    as for the most recent comments. Whoever wants to stay up to date with your content
    can use one of the popular feed aggregators and connect to your website's RSS
    feed. For example, **Feedly** ([https://feedly.com](https://feedly.com)) is a
    popular solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using an RSS feed is also how podcast distribution is handled in WordPress.
    While generating your blog's RSS feeds, WordPress automatically adds all the required
    tags if an audio file is linked within that post. These tags are read by podcast
    clients/tools (such as iTunes). Therefore, all you need to do is create a post,
    and WordPress will handle the rest for you.

    so pay attention to the additional instructions at that point. If you don't want

    use a leveling tool, such as the **Levelator**, which can be found at [http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator/](http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator/).

    (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**). HTTP is a web protocol, through which information
    is sent online between the user's web browser and the website they're trying to
    visit. HTTP defines the structure of this data and the way it's being sent. This
    topic is highly technical, and we certainly don't need to understand it from top
    to bottom just for the purpose of what we're discussing in this chapter.

- en: Overall, the current way in which HTTP is implemented doesn't allow for very
    secure connections. For the most part, with HTTP, data is transmitted in plain
    text, which means that if someone were to intercept the communication, they would
    be able to see everything that's being transmitted. Now, this may not seem like
    much of a problem at first, but imagine what could happen when dealing with sensitive
    information. For example, when you're submitting your credit card information
    at an online checkout, you really don't want it to be intercepted by anyone. Unfortunately,
    HTTP doesn't give you any sort of protection in that area. This is where HTTPS
    comes into play.

- en: '**HTTPS**, which stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure **, is basically
    an upgraded version of HTTP. Under the hood, the main mechanisms that make it
    work are kind of the same; but instead of using its own layer protocol for sending
    data, HTTPS uses additional protocols, secure ones, called a **Secure Sockets
    Layer** (**SSL**), and **Transport Layer Security** (**TLS**). SSL encrypts the
    information that''s being sent, which means that even if someone intercepts it,
    they won''t be able to decode it anyway. The true meaning of the data is not visible
    without the encryption/decryption key.'

    Basically, your web browser will let you know. When you''re visiting a website
    that has HTTPS enabled (and properly integrated), you''ll see a green padlock
    icon next to the website''s address. Additionally, you should also see `https://`
    in the address bar. The following screenshot shows an example of this from PayPal:'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While HTTPS is not a requirement per se, it's still a great step towards a safer
    web overall. Every website that supports HTTPS is simply safer to use, especially
    when dealing with any sort of user input. Quite naturally, people are not happy
    about submitting their personal information anywhere, particularly if they're
    not sure whether this information is going to be taken care of properly. These
    days, we're constantly hearing about hacks and security breaches, even at some
    of the most respectable web properties. With that in the picture, the public becomes
    more concerned with data security and privacy every year.

- en: That said, modern WordPress sites need to embrace the idea to the fullest. There
    really is no downside to having HTTPS enabled on your website, and the process
    of doing it is not too difficult either. Added to this, in 2014, Google announced
    that HTTPS was officially a ranking factor for Google search. What this means
    is that you have a better chance of getting your website ranked, and thus found
    by potential visitors, if you have HTTPS integrated.

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with getting the SSL certificate itself. The thing with this is
    that they often come with a price tag. A good certificate can cost you anywhere
    from a couple of dollars to as much as $600 per year. This probably doesn't sound
    too attractive, but luckily for everyone, there are also good, free SSL options
    out there. Particularly, one called **Let's Encrypt** ([https://letsencrypt.org/](https://letsencrypt.org/)).
    Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open **Certificate Authority** (**CA**).
    It has been found to popularize SSLs and make them affordable for all websites,
    thus increasing the number of websites worldwide with encrypted connections.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way you can get started with Let's Encrypt depends on the web host of where
    your WordPress website is hosted. Usually, at least with most hosts, you can enable
    a Let's Encrypt certificate straight from your hosting control panel. Showing
    the exact steps of how that's done would be difficult to do, since each host has
    their own control panel and their own way of letting you enable a Let's Encrypt
    certificate. Therefore, the first step is to actually contact your host and ask
    them to help you enable the certificate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you do that, you can consult the official documentation at Let's Encrypt
    and make sure that your host does indeed support Let's Encrypt certificates. This
    documentation can be found at [https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920).

    you can finish up the integration in your WordPress dashboard. In order to make

    will log you out of the admin panel. This is normal, so you don't need to be worried
    here. When you try logging back in, you'll notice that you've been redirected
    to the HTTPS version of the admin panel. Just to make sure that everything is
    working, you can try visiting your website at `http://YOURSITE.com`, and see if
    you get automatically redirected to `https://YOURSITE.com`. At this stage, your
    WordPress site is fully integrated with HTTPS!
