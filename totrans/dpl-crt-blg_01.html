Then, the not inconsiderable task of learning the niceties of the chosen language to a respectable degree would consume a fair chunk of time and patience. Once our hapless newcomer had sufficient mastery of the fundamentals, applying that knowledge to program efficiently and reliably, with the tenacity to stick with a job until the site was developed could arguably be described as a Herculean accomplishment.</p><p>This state of affairs is, and quite rightly should be, entirely unacceptable to someone like yourself! It's like forcing lawyers to learn the intricacies of architecture, construction, and masonry simply because they require a courtroom in which to work. It should be quite apparent that separating the technical task of<span class="emphasis"><em> developing the software</em></span> for a website from the<span class="emphasis"><em> function</em></span> of that website is a very sensible thing to do, the main reason being that it allows people to focus on what they are good at without them having to devote time and energy to becoming good software developers too.</p><p>It's not surprising then, that in recent years the open-source community has been hard at work pulling the programming world out of the software dark ages by providing us with flexible frameworks for building web-based enterprises. These frameworks untie website creators from the intellectual burden of learning software development ideas and concepts, allowing them instead to focus more on goal-/business-oriented configuration and customization tasks.</p><p>Drupal is one such result of the software-development evolution and this book seeks to provide you with the fundamental information needed in order to use it effectively to meet your requirements. Because this book focuses more on beginner-level aspects of administering Drupal, you will be pleased to know that there will be little to no coding involved—you're not required to learn how to develop your own Drupal modules, for example. That's not to say your introduction will be elementary; on the contrary, this book will teach you in such a way that you are able to apply your knowledge to tackle problems beyond the scope of this material with confidence.</p><p>Before we begin actually building anything that resembles a website, I'm sure you have plenty of questions about the how, what, where, and why of Drupal. Consequently, this chapter will not only provide a backdrop for the rest of the book, but will also serve as an introduction to the technology as a whole, incorporating a discussion on the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Drupal—an overview</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How Drupal came to be</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What Drupal has to offer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Uses of Drupal</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Building a Drupal site</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Drupal community</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Drupal license</li></ul></div><p>One of the bullets above mentions<span class="emphasis"><em> Building a Drupal Site—this</em></span> section incorporates a look at the demo website, which serves as a basis for all our practical examples. This is needed here because, throughout the book, we will systematically build on each chapter's new information to create a fully functional website. Doing things this way will help relate the lessons you learn to the outcome you can expect on the site. This in turn helps foster sound administration, configuration, and customization methodologies that will help you to develop your own Drupal skills.</p><p>Let's begin…</p><div class="section" title="Drupal—An Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec01"/>Drupal—An Overview</h1></div></div></div><p>The most concise description for Drupal is that it is an<span class="strong"><strong> Open-Source Content Management System</strong></span>. If you are new to both computing and Drupal, then this probably doesn't clear things up very much. Let's analyze this phrase quickly to gain a better understanding. First of all, the term<span class="emphasis"><em> open-source</em></span> is used to describe<span class="emphasis"><em> software whose source code is made available, most often subject to certain conditions, for use or modification by users or other developers as they deem fit</em></span>. The specific conditions under which Drupal is made available will be scrutinized more closely in the section<span class="emphasis"><em> The Drupal License</em></span> later in this chapter.<a class="indexterm" id="id0"/>
</p><p>Above and beyond that, what open source means for you as someone who intends to make use of Drupal, is that you don't have to pay for this unquestionably valuable software. You also join a large community (also to be discussed later in this chapter) of Drupal users, developers, and administrators who subscribe to the open-source philosophy—in other words, someone out there will probably be willing to spend time helping you out should you get stuck.</p><p>If you think about it, that's a pretty good deal for those who are still not convinced about open‑source technologies as a whole—not only do we not have develop the entire site ourselves, but we also get to take advantage of the collective wisdom of thousands of other people. Is there anything else we can say about open source? Sure for one thing, you can be pretty certain that with an active community like the one associated with Drupal, development advances rapidly and flexibly because any problems can be spotted early and dealt with effectively. This means that you can expect a high level of stability, security, and performance from your website.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>So far so good, but what is the Content Management System (CMS) part all about?</em></span> It is necessary for us to take a closer look at what this means in order to gain a sufficient understanding of what we are getting into. We can define a content management system to be<span class="emphasis"><em> software that facilitates the creation, organization, manipulation, and removal of information in the form of images, documents, scripts, plain text (or anything else for that matter)</em></span>. If you have a need to organize and display fairly large amounts of information, especially when it is likely that content will be created or delivered from a variety of different sources, then a content management system is undoubtedly what you need.<a class="indexterm" id="id1"/>
</p><p>That's basically all you have to know. Drupal provides a free platform, along with its attendant community, for satisfying a wide variety of content-management requirements. Precisely, what type of things one can achieve is the subject of the section entitled<span class="emphasis"><em> What Drupal Has to Offer</em></span> later in this chapter. For now though, let's turn back the hands of time and take a look at how we ended up with Drupal as we know it today.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="How Drupal Came to Be"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec02"/>How Drupal Came to Be</h1></div></div></div><p>As with so many modern success stories, this one started in a dorm room with a couple of students needing to achieve a specific goal. In this case, Dries Buytaert and Hans Snijder of the University of Antwerp wished to share an ADSL modem connection to the Internet. They managed this via the use of a wireless bridge, but soon after, Dries decided to work on a news site, which would, in addition to the simple connection the students already shared, allow them to share news and other information.<a class="indexterm" id="id2"/>
</p><p>Over time the site grew and changed as Dries expanded the application and experimented with new things. However, it was only some time later in 2001, when it was decided to release the code to the public in the hope that this would encourage development from other people, that Drupal became open-source software. It's clear that releasing the source to the public was the right choice, because today Drupal has a well organized, thriving community of people ranging from approved contributors, forums, a security team, and a global presence, to plenty of users who make invaluable contributions on a regular basis through bug reports and suggestions.</p><p>In five short years, Dries and others have taken a small inter-dorm-room application and turned it into a technology that is contributing to the way in which the global society communicates through the Web. This is embodied in their brief mission statement, which reads:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>By building on relevant standards and open-source technologies, Drupal supports and enhances the potential of the Internet as a medium where diverse and geographically separated individuals and groups can collectively produce, discuss, and share information and ideas. With a central interest in and focus on communities and collaboration, Drupal's flexibility allows the collaborative production of online information systems and communities.</p></blockquote></div><p>Ultimately, where Drupal is going and how it came to be are also driven by the philosophies that guide those responsible for developing this technology. As you will see throughout the course of this book, it is fair to say that the Drupal community has so far succeeded in meeting its lofty targets.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="What Drupal Has to Offer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec03"/>What Drupal Has to Offer</h1></div></div></div><p>From your perspective, as of now, the subject of this section is the most important topic we need to cover. As users of technology and software, we should never be lax in what we demand from the technologies that serve us. It is fitting, therefore, at this stage to discuss what we expect from Drupal in order to ensure that it will satisfy our needs.</p><p>There are three different aspects of Drupal we need to consider when looking at whether it is a<span class="emphasis"><em> good</em></span> technology to use in general. Will it be:<a class="indexterm" id="id3"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reliable and robust:</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Are there a lot of bugs in the code? Will it affect my site if I have to forever add patches or obtain updates for faulty code?</em></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Efficient:</strong></span><span class="emphasis"><em>Does the code use my server's resources wisely? Am I likely to run into concurrency problems, or speed issues early on?</em></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Flexible:</strong></span><span class="emphasis"><em>If I change my mind about what I want from my site, will I be able to implement those changes without redoing everything from scratch?</em></span></li></ul></div><p>A quick search on Google will confirm that there is an abundance of good reviews on Drupal's performance as well as plenty of write-ups praising its ease of use and flexibility. While Drupal will always be a work in progress, it can be taken for granted that the source code you will use to build your website has been meticulously crafted, and well designed. In fact, the previously listed points are taken so seriously by the developers of Drupal that they are written into their set of principles, which you can read over at<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/node/21945"> http://drupal.org/node/21945</a>.</p><p>While it won't influence us much for the moment, it is worth noting the following:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>A great advantage of Drupal is that the code itself is very well written, which makes modifying it easy. This means that as you attempt more advanced tasks, the very way in which Drupal is written will lend you an advantage over other platforms.</p></div></div><p>The next thing we need to consider is<span class="emphasis"><em> What is Drupal like for us, as the administrators, to use?</em></span> Naturally, we want things to be as easy as possible so that we don't spend time bogged down with problems or complicated settings, or worse yet, have to modify the source code to suit our needs on a regular basis. Ideally, we want a system that is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Easy to set up and run:</strong></span><span class="emphasis"><em>Can I start creating my site with the minimum of fuss? Do I have to learn about a whole bunch of other technologies before I am able to use Drupal?</em></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Intuitive to work with:</strong></span><span class="emphasis"><em>Once I have begun finding my way around, will it be easy to learn new things? If I am not a particularly technical person, will I struggle to administer my site?</em></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Flexible and easy to extend:</strong></span><span class="emphasis"><em>I know I can make a basic site, but I really want to create a unique and sophisticated world beater—can it be done with Drupal?</em></span></li></ul></div><p>Once again, these are precisely the attributes that Drupal is known for. The questions that follow each bullet point are examples of the type of question each attribute answers. If you have other questions about Drupal that are not specifically mentioned here then try to relate them to the bullet points. If you still struggle, try looking through the forums or searching on Google for your answer.<a class="indexterm" id="id4"/>
</p><p>Finally, and perhaps in some respects most importantly, you need to consider whether or not Drupal creates a good environment for your site's users. Obviously, a technology that is well designed, and easy to administer would still not be very helpful if, for example, its use is prohibitively complex. The best way to find out what type of environment Drupal can provide is to go ahead and check out the Drupal home page at<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org"> http://drupal.org</a>. You should probably register an account and become active in the community (believe me, it will be of great benefit to you in the long run) anyway. So perhaps, treat your registration process as a quick and easy way to see a bit of the site.</p><p>It stands to reason that if you can easily make use of the main site that is developed in Drupal, then you in turn will be able to create an easy-to-use site for your community or weblog (also called a blog).</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Uses of Drupal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec04"/>Uses of Drupal</h1></div></div></div><p>From a purely theoretical point of view, you are hopefully convinced that utilizing the Drupal source code to help you create a website is an excellent choice. Of course, knowing this doesn't help you discover exactly what can be done with it from a practical point of view. You still need to know what types of sites are commonly created with Drupal. As mentioned earlier, any enterprise that requires a fair amount of working with content is a likely candidate for Drupal.</p><p>Due to its extensibility and flexibility, you are really not very limited in what you decide to do with Drupal. The following list shows the most common uses at present and comes from the case studies page (
<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/cases">http://drupal.org/cases</a>) on the Drupal site:<a class="indexterm" id="id5"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Community Portal Sites</strong></span> (The term<span class="emphasis"><em> portal</em></span> refers to a site that is supposed to be an Internet user's point of entry on to the Web): If you want a news website where the stories are provided by the audience, Drupal suits your needs well. Incoming stories are automatically voted upon by the audience and the best stories bubble up to the home page. Bad stories and comments are automatically hidden after enough negative votes.<a class="indexterm" id="id6"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Personal Websites:</strong></span> Drupal is great for the user who just wants a personal website where (s)he can keep a weblog, publish some photos, and maybe keep an organized collection of links.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Aficionado Sites:</strong></span> Drupal flourishes when it powers a portal website where one person shares their expertise and enthusiasm for a topic.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Intranet/Corporate Websites:</strong></span> Companies maintain their internal and external websites in Drupal. Drupal works well here because of its flexible permissions system, and its easy web-based publishing. You no longer have to wait for a webmaster to give word about your latest project.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Resource Directories:</strong></span> If you want a central directory for a given topic, Drupal is the right tool for you. Users can register and suggest new resources while editors can screen their submissions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>International Sites:</strong></span> When you begin using Drupal, you join a large international community of users and developers. Thanks to the localization features within Drupal, there are many Drupal sites implemented in a wide range of languages.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Education:</strong></span> Drupal can be used for creating dynamic learning communities to supplement the face-to-face classroom or as a platform for distance education classes. Academic professional organizations benefit from its interactive features and the ability to provide public content, member-only resources, and member subscription management.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Art, Music, and Multimedia:</strong></span> When it comes to community art sites, Drupal is a great match. No other platform provides the rock-solid foundation that is needed to make multimedia rich websites that allow users to share, distribute, and discuss their work with others. As time goes on, Drupal will only develop stronger support for audio, video, images, and playlist content for use in multimedia applications.</li></ul></div><p>I guess I should make it clear that while you can use Drupal for a great number of things, you should perhaps limit what you use it for to those things that complement its design—like those mentioned in the previous list. If you want to retail a large number of goods from your community website, then you might wish to consider using something like osCommerce that is designed specifically for that purpose even though it is possible to retail products off your Drupal site using a contributed module.<a class="indexterm" id="id7"/>
</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Building a Drupal Site"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec05"/>Building a Drupal Site</h1></div></div></div><p>Unlike building a house, development of a website takes place on a<span class="emphasis"><em> copy</em></span> of the site instead of the real site. This means that while the site is being built, it is not available for the public to view and use on the Internet. With a bit of thought, this should make sense. Any potential community member who comes across your site would probably become frustrated with bits and pieces that don't work, error messages, untidy presentation, or any other thing that could scare people away at the drop of a hat.<a class="indexterm" id="id8"/>
</p><p>Some readers may well be wondering what to do with their domain in the meantime, assuming one has already been purchased. The best solution is to put up what is known as a<span class="strong"><strong> placeholder page</strong></span> that delivers a simple message to the effect that this is the right site, the development is in progress on the working site, and that potential members should visit again in the near future.</p><p>If you want to learn how to get a page onto your internet site before going any further, then check out Appendix A on<span class="emphasis"><em> Deployment</em></span>, which outlines the process of moving a fully functional website onto a live web domain. The process for doing the whole site and a single page is more or less the same, but naturally, moving a single page is a lot less complicated.</p><div class="section" title="Planning Your Site"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec01"/>Planning Your Site</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we take a look at what the demo website is going to be, it is important that as the creator of a new site you spend some time gathering information on the needs of the community you are attempting to serve. Doing this now will help you in the long run because having a thorough understanding of your site's requirements allows you to develop it with specific goals in mind. This in turn gives you a more focused and coordinated approach to the site's development.</p><p>One of the best ways to determine what you will need, is to build a list of tasks that the site must be able to perform (by this I mean a written list, not a mental one). Effectively, after creating a list of the various things you need, the site's administrator (most probably yourself) should have a clear enough idea of the requirements to go ahead and begin working. Unfortunately, it is often hard to predict exactly what is needed by simply sitting down and writing. A good way to start is by looking at similar sites. You should go ahead and take note of everything that is useful and desirable on other sites and add this to your list.<a class="indexterm" id="id9"/>
</p><p>If you get stuck, or run out of ideas, it's helpful to try a little thought exercise as follows. Split yourself into two people:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The community member who knows what his or her needs are</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Drupal administrator who needs to find out what to build</li></ul></div><p>Use the administrator persona to question the community member about what has to be done. Approaching the problem from two perspectives often helps mimic real-world situations where software developers try to find out exactly what their clients need by asking probing questions before they start working on a project.</p><p>If you can get to a stage where you feel comfortable that you understand at least 80% of what is required from your site, then it is probably more efficient to go ahead and begin creating the site, rather than waste time scraping out more information. As Drupal is so well designed, extensible, and flexible, it is quite easy to modify it at a later stage should you need to.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What type of requirements should I be looking at?</em></span> you may ask. Here is a list of some of the most important topics you will need to decide on:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The type of site—forums, polls, or other things</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The way you are going to run the site—stats, logging, or performance issues</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The security, roles, and permissions involved</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The need for integration—syndication, aggregation, or alerts</li></ul></div><p>Apart from your site's functionality you should also start thinking about how you want the site to look. Obviously an attractive and unique interface for users to work with is your ultimate goal in this respect. The use of themes to create a visually appealing site is a fairly important topic that we discuss later in the book in<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Drupal's Interface"> Chapter 8</a>, but please do give some thought to this aspect of your site early on regardless.<a class="indexterm" id="id10"/>
</p><p>Of course, you not only want to design an interface that looks pretty, you also want to make it intuitive and easy to use. This is very important as studies have shown that users will often base their opinion of a site on how easy it is to use and not always on other criteria, which you might think important, such as speed. People often believe that a slower running site is faster if they manage to accomplish their tasks on it more easily.</p><p>There is a brief specification of the site that will be built throughout the course of this book in the section entitled The Demo Website later on in this chapter. By observing similar sites and anticipating the needs of your site's users, you can develop a specification for your own Drupal site. Having a site outline or specification to work towards is very valuable in the world of website development—even if Drupal mitigates the need for writing code ourselves.</p></div><div class="section" title="Analyzing the Proposed Solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec02"/>Analyzing the Proposed Solution</h2></div></div></div><p>Once there is a specification to work with, we know<span class="emphasis"><em> what</em></span> we need. It is time to look at<span class="emphasis"><em> how</em></span> to deliver it. Off the top of your head, it may seem that one simply sits down and works through the specification list point by point until everything has been checked off. From one perspective this is absolutely fine and certainly at some stage everything should be ticked off the list. But if we look a little closer, the picture begins to get a bit fuzzy because we really need to go back over all the points listed and find out<span class="emphasis"><em> what is involved</em></span> in getting each one done. Knowing what lies ahead is the best way to handle problems preemptively!<a class="indexterm" id="id11"/>
</p><p>The three main areas of concern that we need to deal with are discussed next.</p><div class="section" title="Feasibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Feasibility</h3></div></div></div><p>Having a wish-list is a great way to decide on what you want, but that doesn't mean it is feasible. In order to be feasible, the criteria should not involve an inordinate amount of effort relative to the benefits it will return. For example, if the site specification calls for a feature that requires a hundred hours of brutal, frustrating programming, then it is probably not in your interests to waste time doing it if it is not going to affect your community significantly.</p><p>Ultimately, it may be better to look for a cheap and elegant alternative either amongst the plethora of contributions, or from third-party software providers. One of the old programming mantras,<span class="emphasis"><em> There's more than one way to do it!</em></span> holds true here.</p></div><div class="section" title="Phone a Friend"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Phone a Friend</h3></div></div></div><p>Look at your requirements very carefully.<span class="emphasis"><em> Are you sure you can actually provide everything that is required?</em></span> If not, spend some time looking over this book and the Drupal site to see if you can learn anything new. If you are absolutely stuck, then get on the forums and lists and ask for help. One of the great things about Drupal is that it is a community-driven project, which roughly translates into:<span class="emphasis"><em> There are generally people around who are happy to help</em></span>. Bear in mind that this is not a one-way relationship, and once you have some experience and knowledge to share, there are always people who are grateful for a helping hand.</p></div><div class="section" title="Critical versus Desirable Criteria"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Critical versus Desirable Criteria</h3></div></div></div><p>In order to determine the priority of tasks during your site's development phase, it is a good idea to divide all your requirements into two categories—those that are fundamentally necessary to the success of your website, such as finding a service provider, and those that are not, such as deciding on whether to make your hyperlink color dark blue or light blue.</p><p>There are a couple of reasons for this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Doing so will help you allocate time and resources to certain tasks while putting others on a backburner.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You are aware of those features that do not necessarily need to be included at all in the event that time is short.</li></ul></div><p>In both these cases, it is important to know what has to be finished and what can perhaps be left out or left for another day. With all that in mind, let's take a look at what the demo site is, and how it intends to meet the requirements of its community…</p></div></div><div class="section" title="The Demo Website"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec03"/>The Demo Website</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to do something fairly distinctive, we will, throughout the course of this book, build a wildlife and conservation community site called<span class="emphasis"><em> The Contechst Wildlife Community</em></span>, or CWC, that will cater to the needs of a wide range of people involved in everything from conservation and rehabilitation to research and policy making. The intention of this site is to become a central meeting point for like-minded people who wish to stimulate discussion and exchange ideas and information, which can be in virtually any form.<a class="indexterm" id="id12"/>
</p><p>Not only is the site going to foster a community feeling by creating regular newsletters and posting information on important events, but it is also going to encourage open debate in its forums. It is hoped that the forums will become a popular meeting place, but this will not in any way be the only facility provided by the site. Regular polls will be taken in order to gather information on various important topics and industry experts will be invited to become bloggers for the site.</p><p>Of course, it is only natural that we will need a striking and pleasing look and feel for the site, which will end up like this (actually, there is a lot more to the site, but in the interests of fitting everything on one page it has been simplified a bit):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="The Demo Website" src="graphics/1800_01_01.jpg"/></div><p>One of the sad facts is that even if this community site is very popular, we will still need to make money out of it just to cover the costs of having someone administer or moderate it. How can we do this without charging people for membership? There are two methods open to most sites that have a large associated community: donations and advertising. Accordingly, the CWC will make use of some third-party software and a downloadable module to raise money.<a class="indexterm" id="id13"/>
</p><p>The CWC is designed to show off much of the default behavior of Drupal, and you will see in due course that the following functionality will be enabled from the default distribution:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Blogs:</strong></span> A blog, or weblog, is almost like a journal, maintained by one person only. In the case of the demo site, there will be a bunch of blog writers who post to the site regularly in order to keep the general public informed about their movements and developments in their specific areas of focus.<a class="indexterm" id="id14"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Books:</strong></span> A book can be created by a wide range of users using pretty much any type of content possible. Polls, pages, weblogs, and others can all be easily added to a book. This is a very interesting feature of Drupal because it allows for the creation of a truly unique online book that can harness the power of web-based dynamic content to give your stories an ultra-modern feel.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Comments:</strong></span> Naturally, in any community, people will feel the urge to comment on topics of interest. Because of this, the Drupal comment functionality allows users to append or attach comments to pretty much any content they like (depending on the permissions set by the administrator). In fact, forums are based on the use of comments, which are added to specific forum topics that have been posted to the site.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Forums:</strong></span> A forum is a medium for discussion and voicing ideas. In the case of the demo site, a variety of different forums will be set up to provide users with an area in which to discuss important subjects and interact. As you will see, you will be able to control the content of forums quite easily if you so desire—in fact, Drupal allows you to examine any and all content that attempts to make its way onto your site.<a class="indexterm" id="id15"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Locale:</strong></span> This allows you to present your site in a variety of different languages in order to create a truly international site. In fact, Drupal goes one step further by allowing individual users to select their language of preference in order to view it in that language automatically whenever they log on.<a class="indexterm" id="id16"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Polls:</strong></span> The poll content type allows an administrator (or whoever has sufficient permissions) to create a content type, which contains a question and several options from which poll users can select their preferred answer. This is a useful tool for gathering pretty much any sort of information ranging from what features your users would like to see on your site, to whether or not people believe there is life on other planets.<a class="indexterm" id="id17"/></li></ul></div><p>There are actually quite a few more features that will be utilized in order to make our site fully operational, but we need not go through all of them here as some of them are fairly trivial, and others are explained in detail later on in the book. Trust me, there is plenty more to work on!</p><p>From the previous list you can tell that there is already a powerful set of features available to Drupal administrators and we will actually look at how to enable, modify, and use all these features and many more, in due course.</p><p>We are not limited to using only those features that come with Drupal by default. Drupal has been designed to make it easy for people other than the developers to enhance it with more functionality. The modular design of Drupal means that creating entirely new functionality is often as simple as copying a few files into your Drupal folders—although, admittedly it can be more complex and we will also look at contributions that require modifications to the database amongst other things.</p><p>The CWC will make use of a whole bunch of contributed modules including, but not limited to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Taxonomy Access:</strong></span> Allows the administrator to maintain exceptionally fine-grained control over who is allowed to do what and on what type of content. As you will see later, there will be certain users whose help is required to moderate the forums but who should not have any other broad-based powers. Using this contribution makes it easy to outline the permissions for any user based on the type of content you want them to work with.<a class="indexterm" id="id18"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Flexinode:</strong></span> Provides the administrator with the ability to create custom content types. This can be exceptionally useful if there is a specific need that cannot be easily catered for using one of the standard content types like a page or blog.<a class="indexterm" id="id19"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Adsense:</strong></span> Allows administrators to incorporate advertising from Google. In this way, traffic from your site can be directed to related sites for a small payment. If you have enough traffic moving through your site then these small payments can mount up, providing you with a nice source of revenue.<a class="indexterm" id="id20"/></li></ul></div><p>Not content with simply utilizing various modules to add functionality to the site, we will also get our hands dirty by ensuring we have properly structured the site's content using the taxonomy system provided by Drupal. We will also look at how to add some dynamic additions to the site using third-party scripts and even AJAX.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The Drupal Community"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec06"/>The Drupal Community</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the most important resources you will need in the coming days, weeks, months, and years is the Drupal online community. Unlike other open-source projects, which are sometimes criticized for their lack of coherent and in-depth support structures, you will find that Drupal is very well done and fairly easy to learn your way around. There are a host of categories ranging from information, polls, forums, and news to support, which can be found at the home page:<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org"> http://drupal.org</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="id21"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>It will be assumed in the rest of the book that you have taken some time to familiarize yourself with how the site works.</p></div></div><p>It is strongly recommended that you regularly make use of<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org"> drupal.org</a> and constantly use different elements and sections in order to become proficient at extracting the information and software you require to run your enterprise—especially since the Drupal site will change from time to time! For precisely this reason, you might also notice that there are small differences between this book and Drupal itself.</p><p>All the information contained in the site is well organized and easy to access from the main navigation bar at the top of the page, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="The Drupal Community" src="graphics/1800_01_02.jpg"/></div><p>Each and every tab in the navigation bar has a host of its own links and pages although there are some categories that contain inter-related topics. You should note, that when we refer to<span class="emphasis"><em> community</em></span> in this book, we are talking about the entire Drupal community, including all the support structures, developers, users, and so on—not to be confused with the<span class="strong"><strong> Community</strong></span> tab on the front page that refers more to the different Drupal communities around the world (more on this in a moment).</p><p>At any rate, let's go through each and every one quickly to see what they have to offer.</p><div class="section" title="Support"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec04"/>Support</h2></div></div></div><p>To begin, the<span class="strong"><strong> Support</strong></span> section can be regarded as a kind of catch-all page, and actually contains a number of links to the various other community pages, many of which can also be opened by using their tabs in the main navigation bar. For example, you can navigate to the<span class="strong"><strong> Drupal handbook</strong></span> (to be discussed shortly) from the<span class="strong"><strong> Online documentation</strong></span> section if you need to find out some basic information on Drupal, as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id22"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Support" src="graphics/1800_01_03.jpg"/></div><p>Briefly, in this section:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Documentation and help facilities are provided in the<span class="strong"><strong> Online documentation</strong></span> section, and include help on some common problems as well as installation and general information.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Links to security advisories and announcements as well as the option to subscribe to the security announcement mailing list or RSS feed are provided under the<span class="strong"><strong> Security</strong></span> section.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Links to the forums, in case you need help, are provided under the<span class="strong"><strong> Forums and Support</strong></span> section, as well as archives and a<span class="strong"><strong> Tips for posting to the Drupal forums link</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you are not an English language speaker, or your community predominantly speaks some other language, then it is worthwhile checking out some of the other language sites under the<span class="strong"><strong> Other languages</strong></span> section, which includes German, French, Spanish, and Afrikaans.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Links to a number of professional services related to Drupal, including hosting and consulting, are provided under the<span class="strong"><strong> Professional services and hosting</strong></span> section.<a class="indexterm" id="id23"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Bug reports can be sent in by visiting the<span class="strong"><strong> Bug reports</strong></span> section. Please be aware that you should always check whether or not a bug has been reported before submitting your own report. Any submission incurs a cost in terms of man-hours because someone has to look over it, and the time wastage can be substantial if everyone keeps reporting the same bug over and over again.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<span class="strong"><strong> Feature requests</strong></span> section gives you the opportunity to look over what other people would like to see incorporated into Drupal as shown here:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Support" src="graphics/1800_01_04.jpg"/></div><p>Of course, you can also submit your own requests.
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There is also an interesting option to obtain support over an<span class="strong"><strong> IRC channel</strong></span>. IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, allows for real-time, typed discussions over the Internet. Joining a group like this is obviously a great advantage in that it immediately gives you access to many other Drupal people.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There is a support<span class="strong"><strong> Mailing list</strong></span> section that you can join, a<span class="strong"><strong> Developer support</strong></span> section, and a forum to raise issues about the actual Drupal website under the<span class="strong"><strong> Drupal.org problems</strong></span> section. Recently, a new section entitled<span class="strong"><strong> Books about Drupal</strong></span> has been added too.</li></ul></div><p>If in doubt as to where to go, the<span class="strong"><strong> Support</strong></span> page is probably where you should start off. More often than not though, you will have a fairly good idea of what you need, and should be able to go straight there.<a class="indexterm" id="id24"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Handbooks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec05"/>Handbooks</h2></div></div></div><p>This section is a great repository of information, catering for a wide variety of different needs. The content is gathered into five main sections as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id25"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Handbooks" src="graphics/1800_01_05.jpg"/></div><p>Each of these categories contains a series of links to informative pages (that often in turn contain links to other pages) that do a good job of explaining their respective topics. It's worth pointing out that a block appears on the left-hand side of these pages, containing links to related topics under the same category heading in order to help you navigate through the information with ease. The following screenshot shows the<span class="strong"><strong> Is Drupal right for you?</strong></span> page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Handbooks" src="graphics/1800_01_06.jpg"/></div><p>You are urged to look through at least the first section before moving on to the following chapter in order to learn as much about Drupal as possible. It is also a good idea to use these handbooks in tandem with this book so that you can complement the practical advice and experience you gain here with reference-type material presented on the site.<a class="indexterm" id="id26"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Forum"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"/>Forum</h2></div></div></div><p>The forums are probably your single greatest problem-solving resource and information-based asset. Unlike the other types of information on the site (with the exception of the Freenode Drupal IRC), which are largely static, written answers or guides, the forums provide you with an interactive environment in which you can learn and extend your knowledge. Of course, they also provide you with a medium for sharing whatever you have learned as well.<a class="indexterm" id="id27"/>
</p><p>At the time of writing, there were approximately 100,000 support-related posts alone. This should give you a good idea of how widely used these forums are. The following screenshot shows the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum</strong></span> home page as well as the first few forum categories. From the large number of posts you can tell that this is already a fairly large repository of knowledge and hopefully you will take the time to add to it yourself.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Forum" src="graphics/1800_01_07.jpg"/></div><p>Looking at the entire page, there are three main forum categories—<span class="strong"><strong>General, Support</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Development</strong></span>—that in turn have a number of subcategories to make navigating the structure fairly easy. You will also notice that there is a block on the right-hand side of the page containing a list of the most recent posts. As well as this, you can also use the search tool, shown at the top right-hand side of the page or at<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/search/node"> http://drupal.org/search/node</a>, to search for relevant information or users.</p><p>Finally, assuming you are a registered (and logged-on) Drupal user, you can also post new topics to the forum using the link given under the page's main heading as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id28"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Forum" src="graphics/1800_01_08.jpg"/></div><p>Before you start posting off hundreds of questions and salutations, please be aware that there is a certain etiquette to using these forums, and it should be followed at all times. Look at the following page before you begin making any posts to the site:<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/forum-posting"> http://drupal.org/forum-posting</a>. A quick summary is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Make sure you have searched the forums for similar posts already. Use those posts instead of creating redundant information.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Make your forum post titles informative and meaningful.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ensure that you submit a good amount of system-specific information in your support queries—for example, mention the Drupal version you are using along with the database and database version.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Bear in mind that not everyone using the forum is a native English speaker; so some posts may be construed as rude or abrupt even when that is not the intention.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Remain polite and reasonable—even if you are frustrated over a particular problem.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Donate some time to responding to and helping other posters.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you would like, enable your contact tab so that people can offer support via email. You can do this by editing your contact information as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id29"/></li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Forum" src="graphics/1800_01_09.jpg"/></div><p>Some of you may have noticed the link entitled<span class="strong"><strong> Active forum discussions</strong></span> in the screenshot before last. Clicking on this link brings up a list of the topics that have recent posts, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Forum" src="graphics/1800_01_10.jpg"/></div><p>If you would prefer to view the discussions that you personally have contributed to, then click the<span class="strong"><strong> My forum discussions</strong></span> link instead.</p></div><div class="section" title="Downloads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Downloads</h2></div></div></div><p>We will be visiting this section again in the following chapter when we begin to set up everything in preparation for the development of your site. However, there are a few interesting points to note before we get there. The first is that you need to be quite careful about the Drupal version, or indeed modules and themes, you download because each successive version makes changes and improvements on previous versions, but also sometimes messes up compatibility with other features.<a class="indexterm" id="id30"/>
</p><p>For example, you can see that the downloads page provides us with some interesting information on compatibility with PHP from the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Downloads" src="graphics/1800_01_11.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, Drupal 4.5 will not work with PHP 5. Now, this in itself is no great problem because it is quite likely that your hosting services will remain with PHP 4 for some time yet. However, at some stage most service providers will upgrade to PHP 5 support since PHP 5 is a far more sophisticated language than its predecessor. Knowing this, you might immediately say that this doesn't worry us because Drupal 4.6 is available (and so is 4.7).<a class="indexterm" id="id31"/>
</p><p>That's quite right, but if you decide to add a module (by this I mean that at some stage you<span class="emphasis"><em> will</em></span> want to add a module) then viewing the projects page at<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/project">http://drupal.org/project</a>, or by clicking the<span class="strong"><strong> Downloads</strong></span> tab gives:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Downloads" src="graphics/1800_01_12.jpg"/></div><p>You can see from the notes presented on this page, if you happen to need a module that was developed for Drupal 4.5, and you are using version 4.6, then you are shortly going to experience no small amount of frustration—this is especially valid at this time because 4.7 is brand new, and hence many modules have yet to be updated.<a class="indexterm" id="id32"/>
</p><p>Problems like this can occur because modules are developed separately from the core, which means that it is up to the individual module developer to keep up to date with any changes coming from the main development team.</p><p>Naturally, not everyone will keep the modules up to date in a timely manner because often these developers are not getting paid and are under no obligation to do the work at all. They are simply providing us with the best code they can deliver when they can deliver it, and we should obviously be grateful for that.</p><p>In terms of how to use the download pages, it is worth noting that there are three links given at the bottom right of each downloadable item's box. These are<span class="strong"><strong> Download, Find out more</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Bugs and feature requests</strong></span>. Obviously the first option is pretty self explanatory, but you should always take a look at the<span class="strong"><strong> Find out more</strong></span> option before downloading anything to ensure that you are getting precisely what you want.<a class="indexterm" id="id33"/>
</p><p>For example, the<span class="strong"><strong> Find out more</strong></span> page for the<span class="strong"><strong> Acidfree</strong></span> project contains information on<span class="strong"><strong> Known limitations</strong></span>, a history of<span class="strong"><strong> Updates</strong></span>, and plenty of material on<span class="strong"><strong> Releases, Resources, Support</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Development</strong></span>—all pretty useful if you are not sure what Acidfree does to begin with.<a class="indexterm" id="id34"/>
</p><p>That aside, the point of this section is that you should try to<span class="emphasis"><em> think carefully</em></span> about what you want from your site before you go ahead and begin downloading everything. In the next chapter we will put words into practice and make use of this section to obtain a copy of Drupal.<a class="indexterm" id="id35"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Contribute"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Contribute</h2></div></div></div><p>At first glance you might be forgiven for thinking that there is very little you can meaningfully contribute to the Drupal community while you are still learning the software. As this is not entirely true, it is worthwhile seeing what there is available to us:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Contribute" src="graphics/1800_01_13.jpg"/></div><p>For starters, the easiest way to support Drupal is by making donations—I can all but hear the sighs and groans as you read this, but bear in mind what you are getting is absolutely free. You can also help market Drupal by writing reviews, or incorporating the Druplicon onto your site and so on. There is also always a need for people to help test, translate, support, and document Drupal.<a class="indexterm" id="id36"/>
</p><p>Finally, once you have gained some experience and feel confident enough, you can look towards helping with Drupal development. Whatever you choose to do, you will find that any information or help you require in order to become pro-active within the community is readily available under the<span class="strong"><strong> Contribute</strong></span> section.</p></div><div class="section" title="Contact and Community"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Contact and Community</h2></div></div></div><p>These two sections are fairly self explanatory so I have lumped them together. The<span class="strong"><strong> Contact</strong></span> page simply allows you to send an email off to the Drupal team, and you need to remember that no technical support queries will be addressed here—you must use the support forum for that. Simply ensure you select the most pertinent category from the drop-down list provided and away you go. An example is shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id37"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Contact and Community" src="graphics/1800_01_14.jpg"/></div><p>That's easy enough to do! Moving on to the<span class="strong"><strong> Community</strong></span> page, you can see that this gives you access to the various international Drupal communities as well as a few aggregated resources and tag services that you might find interesting to read:<a class="indexterm" id="id38"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Contact and Community" src="graphics/1800_01_15.jpg"/></div><p>Incidentally, a tagging service is simply a bunch of pages that have been associated with various keywords. This makes it easy to find content based on a user-defined categorization—doing things this way is also very flexible as you no longer have to pigeon-hole content into predefined categories. You can find more information on tags and tagging at the del.icio.us site:<a class="ulink" href="http://del.icio.us/help/tags"> http://del.icio.us/help/tags</a>.</p><p>That about wraps it up for our coverage of the Drupal community. You should feel fairly confident that you can use the site efficiently and that you can find help if needs be. Before we continue on to the next chapter, though, there is one more important issue we need to discuss …</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The Drupal License"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec07"/>The Drupal License</h1></div></div></div><p>Naturally, you should want to inform yourself of any and all legalities and responsibilities you have when it comes to using software developed by others. To this end, you will find that when you download a copy of Drupal, it will contain a license file for your perusal—it is actually required as part of the license that this copy be included.<a class="indexterm" id="id39"/>
</p><p>If you're like me then you find it challenging to remain awake when faced with the prospect of reading through licenses and other legal documents. So, instead of subjecting you to a verbatim recount of the entire license, I will instead give you the paraphrased version that is intended to provide you with the<span class="emphasis"><em> essence</em></span> of what the license is getting at as it applies to Drupal.</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>Please bear in mind that what I say here is in no way a legal document. You<span class="strong"><strong> must</strong></span> read the whole license yourself if you wish to follow the letter of the law.</p></div></div><p>As odd as it may sound, one of the fundamental reasons for using the GNU GPL (General Public License) is to protect and help you—the people who use the software. The GPL is fundamentally different from the licenses of proprietary software, which by and large are designed to protect the rights of the corporate entities that developed and created the software.<a class="indexterm" id="id40"/>
</p><p>Incidentally, the GPL is not tied specifically to Drupal; rather Drupal makes use of the GPL, which is a kind of generic license for distributing open-source software. You can check out the GNU home page for more information on this movement in general:<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/home.html"> http://www.gnu.org/home.html</a>.</p><p>The way things work is that the software is copyrighted and then licensed for everyone to use freely. This might strike you as a little odd at first because<span class="emphasis"><em> what is the point of copyrighting something if you are simply going to let anyone else make use of it?</em></span> The reason for this is that copyrighting and licensing the software gives the developer the power to obligate people who use that software to afford everyone they hand it out to (with or without modifications) the same rights that are vested in the original software.</p><p>What this means is that, effectively, anyone who makes use of this software cannot create proprietary software from it. So, if you decide to build upon and improve Drupal yourself in order to sell it on as your own product, then you will be bound by the same terms and will have to release your source code to anyone who asks for it. Remember though, the aim of the GPL is not to take credit for your own work by forcing you to release it under the GPL. If you have developed identifiable programs or code that are wholly your own and are independent from the original source code provided, then the GPL does not necessarily apply to your work.</p><p>A summary of some of the main points in the license is as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id41"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You are free to copy the software covered by the GPL as well as distribute these copies however you see fit. The most important thing to do is make sure you don't remove the licensing.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You can hack around with the source code and create whatever type of derived product you want. Again, you must pass on the same license (as you received it) with the original code, only this time you must make sure you also make it very clear what changes you have made. (This is to protect the original programmers in the event you introduce a virus that destroys the Internet.)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You mustn't break the terms of the GPL at any stage or you will find your current license to use the software terminated.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You aren't forced to accept the conditions of the license. (You can tell this from the fact that you don't have to sign anything.) However, if you don't accept the terms of the license, you can't make use of the software.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you do decide to redistribute the software yourself, then you can't add restrictions or modify the license in any way. You also aren't required to ensure that the parties you distribute the software to comply with it.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you are compelled by a court ruling (or any other legal proceeding) to enforce conditions that do not meet the requirements of the GPL, then you must not distribute the software at all.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Keep an eye on the version of the license that is distributed with the software. If there is one present then you must use that version or a later one, but not an earlier one.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There is no warranty on this software, and no one who modifies or distributes the software in terms of the GPL is responsible for anything—especially damages or failure to operate and so on.<a class="indexterm" id="id42"/></li></ul></div><p>At the end of the day, if you are just going to use Drupal to build a website, all you really need to know is that it is both free in terms of price and in terms of who gets access to its source code. The cynics among you may be saying something like:<span class="emphasis"><em> This all sounds like a bunch of hooey. You can't even provide a warranty or guarantee that the software will work because no one has the money to pay for real development</em></span>. Well, you don't need to worry about that. Open-source software is among the best and most reliable in the world exactly because everyone in the world can see the code and improve on it.</p><p>The only time you do need to worry about the niceties of the GPL is when you decide to set up a business installing, configuring, and customizing Drupal websites for money, or modifying, and redistributing the original source code.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter has served as an introduction to the world of Drupal as well as backdrop for the rest of the book. Several important things were discussed here, which will play an important role in the future as you develop your skills and knowledge.</p><p>Without a doubt, one of the most important aspects of becoming a successful Drupal administrator is being able to make efficient use of the community. By now you should have registered on the Drupal site and taken at least a cursory glance at much of it. As time goes by, you will hopefully develop relationships with other members and eventually become a great asset for the community at large.</p><p>In addition, this chapter took some time to look at the demo website that will be built throughout the rest of the book. This demonstrated that even at a beginner level we are able to create an extremely powerful web-based application that can be used to drive entire communities—all without having to learn any programming at all. That's not to say that there is no work involved—no doubt you found researching and deciding on what your site requires fairly tedious. Remember though that any background work you put in now will pay off later; so it's definitely worth it.</p><p>With the introductory material out the way, it is time to get down to business, and the next chapter will see us setting up the development environment as well as obtaining and installing the latest version of Drupal.</p></div></body></html>
