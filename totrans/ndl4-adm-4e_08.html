<h1 id="_idParaDest-169" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Understanding Moodle Plugins</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Your system is fully operational and has a look and feel that reflects your organization’s branding. As with all complex web-based applications, a significant number of configuration activities can be carried out to bring Moodle in line with your organization’s needs <span class="No-Break" lang="">and requirements.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">In this chapter, we will first provide an overview of plugins. Then, we will explore some third-party plugins and learn about their powers. We will then understand how to install, update, and delete plugins before we conclude with plugin evaluation criteria, popular plugins, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">organizational decisions.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">One of the many strengths of Moodle is its pluggable architecture. Moodle supports a wide range of plugins, which we are going to shed light on by covering the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">Moodle plugins – <span class="No-Break" lang="">an overview</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">The power of <span class="No-Break" lang="">third-party plugins</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Managing third-party plugins (install, update, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and delete)</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Good plugins and bad plugins (plugin evaluation criteria, popular plugins, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">organizational decisions)</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">A word on terminology: we will use plugin, module, and add-on interchangeably in <span class="No-Break" lang="">this chapter.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Let’s start with an overview of plugins <span class="No-Break" lang="">and integrations.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-170" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Moodle plugins – an overview</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>is a (very) modular system – that’s what the <em class="italic" lang="">M</em> in Moodle stands for, after all – and most of Moodle’s functionality has been implemented as modules, <span class="No-Break" lang="">called plugins.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Moodle plugins <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>are modules that provide some specific, usually <span class="No-Break" lang="">ring-fenced, functionality.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Navigate to the <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> tab in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> area. You will find two menu items dealing <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>with installing and managing plugins before all plugin types are <span class="No-Break" lang="">shown underneath.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Let’s get started with <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins overview</strong>, which displays a list of all the installed plugins. The information shown for each plugin includes <span class="No-Break" lang="">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Plugin name</strong>: The official name of <span class="No-Break" lang="">the plugin.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Component name</strong>: A unique internal identifier, shown underneath the <span class="No-Break" lang="">plugin name.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Version</strong>: The plugin version number, in date format. Some third-party plugins also show the supported <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle version.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Availability</strong>: Enabled <span class="No-Break" lang="">or disabled.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Actions</strong>: A link to the plugin settings, <span class="No-Break" lang="">if available.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Uninstall</strong>: An option to delete the plugin; unavailable for some <span class="No-Break" lang="">core plugins.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Notes</strong>: Additional information, usually in the form of dependencies <span class="No-Break" lang="">or errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins overview</strong> window shown in <span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic" lang="">.1</em> is helpful to get a quick overview of what has been installed on your system and what functionality is available. You can also perform a check for available updates via the button at the top of <span class="No-Break" lang="">the screen.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Select the <strong class="bold" lang="">Additional plugins</strong> link to see which third-party plugins have been installed. There are 16 additional plugins on my Moodle system. We utilized some in <a href="B18779_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Enhancing Moodle’s Look and Feel</em>; we will install the other plugins later in <span class="No-Break" lang="">this chapter.</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1 – Installed plugins</p>
<p lang="en-GB">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>also see that each plugin has been placed in a category, a so-called <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>plugin type, which is a good filter criterion when searching for third-party plugins, as we will <span class="No-Break" lang="">see later.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Tip</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Plugins are <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>grouped into <strong class="bold" lang="">plugin types</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">plugin subtypes</strong>. For more <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>technical information, check <span class="No-Break" lang="">out </span><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Plugin_types"><span class="No-Break" lang="">docs.moodle.org/dev/Plugin_types</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">As you can see from your instance’s long list of entries, Moodle already ships with over 400 plugins. Most plugins work within the realm of Moodle itself; that is, they do not need to communicate with any other systems. However, some plugins – <strong class="bold" lang="">integration plugins</strong> – require <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>some sort of data exchange with other systems or services. We <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>have <strong class="bold" lang="">system plugins</strong> at the other end of the spectrum, which need some internal configuration to <span class="No-Break" lang="">function correctly.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Our plugins <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>overview diagram follows the same structure and order as Moodle’s list of <span class="No-Break" lang="">plugin types:</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.2 – Moodle plugins overview</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Some plugin types have not been listed in this diagram. They either represent a niche type, for example, document converters and development tools, such as web service protocols, or are treated differently, such <span class="No-Break" lang="">as themes.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The tiny <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>bubbles attached to each plugin in <span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic" lang="">.2</em> indicate in which chapter the plugin is covered.

<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Be careful when modifying settings in any of the plugins. Inappropriate values can cause problems throughout <span class="No-Break" lang="">the system.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">We haven’t <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>mentioned one type of plugin called <strong class="bold" lang="">local plugins</strong> yet. The <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>directory is the recommended place for customizations that do not fit the plugin types we already mentioned. These customizations can be changed according to the existing functionalities or the introduction of new features. For more information on local plugins, check out the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">readme.txt</strong> file in the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">local</strong> directory located <span class="No-Break" lang="">in </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="source-inline" lang="">dirroot</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">A plugin <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>stores data in up to <span class="No-Break" lang="">three locations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">It always stores <strong class="bold" lang="">code</strong> in <strong class="source-inline" lang="">dirroot</strong>. This is the <span class="No-Break" lang="">plugin itself.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">It might store data in the <strong class="bold" lang="">database</strong>, such as configuration settings or <span class="No-Break" lang="">user data.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">It can store <strong class="bold" lang="">files</strong> in <strong class="source-inline" lang="">dataroot</strong>, for example, images <span class="No-Break" lang="">or videos.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">The following diagram visualizes <span class="No-Break" lang="">these dependencies:</span></p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.3 – Plugin data</p>
<p lang="en-GB">If you delete any plugin – core or custom – used anywhere in Moodle, all of its already-created <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>instances will be deleted, including any associated user data! Deleting a plugin cannot be undone; it has to be installed <span class="No-Break" lang="">from scratch.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Do not delete any core plugins unless you are 100% sure you will never need them again. If you wish to prevent the usage of a core plugin, it is better to hide it instead of <span class="No-Break" lang="">remove it.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">With that stark warning, let’s extend your Moodle system with <span class="No-Break" lang="">third-party plugins.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-171" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>The power of third-party plugins</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">A plethora of third-party Moodle software exists that adds new functionality, fixes shortcomings, or integrates Moodle with external systems and cloud services. Let’s start with an overview of <span class="No-Break" lang="">third-party software.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle ships <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>with a comprehensive set of core plugins. While the provided functionalities sufficiently satisfy a majority of use cases, there is a growing demand for additional software. Also, requirements change over time, and new functionalities are needed in your <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle system.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Due to Moodle’s open source nature and modularity, it is relatively straightforward for developers to add new functionality or modify existing features. These can range from minor <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>modifications (patches) or hacks to full-blown modules. You can access the <strong class="bold" lang="">plugin directory</strong> by visiting <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins">moodle.org/plugins</a>, which contains all the approved non-core plugins (<span class="No-Break" lang="">and themes).</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You have <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>three options to navigate through the <span class="No-Break" lang="">plugin directory:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">Using <strong class="bold" lang="">Search</strong> with the help of <span class="No-Break" lang="">a keyword</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Using <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugin types</strong> combined with other criteria, such as version <span class="No-Break" lang="">or purpose</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Using <strong class="bold" lang="">Navigation</strong> in the side block where you can also contribute <span class="No-Break" lang="">new plugins</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Either way, you should always end up with a list of add-ons. Once you click on the plugin’s name, you will see details such as a description, installation instructions, statistics, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and translations.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">At the time of writing, there are over 2,000 third-party Moodle plugins, and the number is growing continuously. You will find all kinds of add-ons, from the weird and wonderful to the <span class="No-Break" lang="">very powerful.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Now that we know where to locate plugins, let’s see how to install, update, and delete them in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">next section.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-172" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Managing third-party plugins</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">The management <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>of third-party plugins comprises the basic standard operations of add, change, and delete. There are four different ways to install, update, and uninstall plugins, which we will cover in <span class="No-Break" lang="">this section:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">Installation via the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">web interface</strong></span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Manual</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> installation</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Installation <span class="No-Break" lang="">via </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Git</strong></span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Installation via the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">command line</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Once you have added, modified, or removed a plugin via any of the four methods, you need to trigger the Moodle updater from <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Notifications</strong>, which will manage the data stored in the database and <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moodledata</strong>. These processes are shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer226">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.4 – Plugin management</p>
<p lang="en-GB">If the updater has added any configurable settings, they will be displayed on a separate <strong class="bold" lang="">New settings</strong> page. This screen will be skipped if the plugin doesn’t contain any <span class="No-Break" lang="">new parameters.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Installing, updating, and removing plugins should always be done in maintenance mode, which is activated from <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Server</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Maintenance mode</strong>. While it is possible to add most plugins while Moodle is in use, it is not recommended as this can lead to <span class="No-Break" lang="">unforeseen problems.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>following subsections, we will deal with the three standard management operations to install, update, and delete plugins by installing some popular <span class="No-Break" lang="">third-party add-ons.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-173" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Installing third-party add-ons</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Installing plugins to your Moodle system can greatly enhance the set of features and, consequently, your users’ experience. However, we recommend avoiding experimenting with new <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>add-ons on your production site(s). Most organizations set up a shadow site of their live server to be used as a sandbox. Once the installation has been successful, the procedure is reapplied on the <span class="No-Break" lang="">production site.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Try out new plugins on a staging or test site first. Back up your production site before installing <span class="No-Break" lang="">new plugins.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Additionally, it is recommended that you make a complete site backup before installing any third-party software. This way, you can roll it back in case of a disaster. We will deal with backups in <a href="B18779_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor308"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Avoiding Sleepless Nights – Moodle Backup </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">and Restore</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Ensure the plugin version is compatible with the version of Moodle you <span class="No-Break" lang="">are running.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Most add-ons are structured in a very similar way. However, some modules either don’t follow this standardized approach or require other steps, particularly when the module communicates with other software systems. Each plugin should contain a file (usually) called <strong class="source-inline" lang="">README</strong>, and it is important to read the instructions inside it before starting the <span class="No-Break" lang="">installation process.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">We will demonstrate each installation type (web interface, manual, Git, and command line) by adding a popular plugin, starting with Video Time, which we already mentioned in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">previous chapter.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Installing the Video Time plugin via the web interface</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">The <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>easiest way to <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>install a plugin is by going to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> |<strong class="bold" lang=""> Install Plugins</strong>. However, you must ensure that the <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>target directory on your server is writable, which is not recommended in production sites for security reasons but is usually acceptable on test sites. There are two options for using the web-based <span class="No-Break" lang="">plugin installer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Install plugin from </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Moodle plugins</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">This option <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>will direct you to the familiar plugins <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>section at <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins">moodle.org/plugins</a>, where you must log in, to perform installations. Also, bear in mind <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>that your site’s full name, URL, and Moodle version will be transferred to ensure a smooth installation process. Once you have located the plugin you wish to install (here, Video Time), you will see an additional <strong class="bold" lang="">Install now</strong> <span class="No-Break" lang="">button appear:</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.5 – Installing plugins from Moodle plugins I</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Once selected, a list of your sites will be shown, and you need to select <strong class="bold" lang="">Install now</strong> again. You will be redirected back to your Moodle site, where a message will indicate whether the plugin can be installed or a problem has arisen; for instance, the target directory is not writable. Once this has been confirmed, the plugin <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>validation will be carried out, and the <a id="_idIndexMarker766"/>already-familiar <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins check</strong> screen has to be confirmed before the installation is <span class="No-Break" lang="">carried out.</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">Alternatively, you <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>can download and upload <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>the plugin by navigating to the <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Install Plugins</strong> interface.

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.7 – Installing plugins from a ZIP file</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The installer automatically detects the type of plugins that correctly declare their <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>component’s name. If auto-detection fails, choose the <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>correct plugin type manually. The installation procedure can fail if an incorrect plugin type is specified! If you need to change the root directory for the plugin installation, change the <strong class="bold" lang="">Rename the root </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">directory</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> setting.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The installation via ZIP files lets you add plugins not only from the public plugin repository on <a href="http://moodle.org">moodle.org</a> but also from other sources, such as trusted developers or (Premium) <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle Partners.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The advantage of the two covered web-based installation methods is their simplicity; the price to pay is compromised site security. The following plugin installation method overcomes <span class="No-Break" lang="">this restriction.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Installing the Zoom meeting plugin manually</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">You <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>can perform these <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>installation tasks manually as an alternative to installing plugins via the admin interface. To demonstrate these steps, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>chosen the <strong class="bold" lang="">Zoom meeting</strong> plugin, which became very popular during the pandemic when working from a home office was the norm for many and the demand for video conference calls <span class="No-Break" lang="">increased significantly.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">After locating the add-on in the plugins repository (<a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/mod_zoom">moodle.org/plugins/mod_zoom</a>), download the version of the software that fits the version of your Moodle system (here, 4.0). Next, put Moodle in maintenance mode (<strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Server</strong> |<strong class="bold" lang=""> </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Maintenance mode</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">).</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The module follows the standardized structure of add-ons; it uses Moodle’s predefined directory <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>hierarchy and naming convention. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>best to copy the ZIP file to the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">$CFG-&gt;dirroot/mod</strong> directory and unpack the file via the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">unzip</strong> command. You might have to change the user and group attributes of the folder. Depending on their type, other plugins must be placed in other directories <span class="No-Break" lang="">in </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="source-inline" lang="">$CFG-&gt;dirroot</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Now, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Notifications</strong>, where the module behind this page will recognize that a new module has to be installed and kick off <span class="No-Break" lang="">the updater.</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">You will see a new entry in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> plugin types called <strong class="source-inline" lang="">/mod/zoom</strong> with the <strong class="bold" lang="">To be installed</strong> status. Once you confirm this via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Upgrade Moodle database now</strong> button, database tables with fields are created and populated with values. The overall success of the installation will <span class="No-Break" lang="">be displayed.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">If a new <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>plugin contains settings that can be <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>configured via the admin interface, they will be displayed on a separate <strong class="bold" lang="">New settings</strong> page. The <strong class="bold" lang="">Zoom meeting</strong> plugin has over 40 new parameters, which can be entered straight away (or left at their defaults), or later via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugin</strong> tab. In the case of our <strong class="bold" lang="">Zoom</strong> plugin, you must provide <strong class="source-inline" lang="">apikey</strong>, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">apisecret</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline" lang="">zoomurl</strong> for the module <span class="No-Break" lang="">to function.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">That’s it! All you have to do now is ensure the module works as expected.

<p lang="en-GB">Finally, don’t forget to disable Moodle’s maintenance mode and let your users know the new functionality <span class="No-Break" lang="">is available!</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">An alternative to manually installing third-party plugins is to install and update them via Git, which we will cover in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Installing the Workplace certificate manager via Git</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">Developers <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>are encouraged to <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>maintain their personal Git <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>repositories, which might contain multiple Moodle extensions. We will use the popular <strong class="bold" lang="">Workplace certificate manager</strong> to demonstrate how to install a contributed extension from its Git repository. As the name suggests, the plugin is part of Moodle Workplace <a id="_idIndexMarker781"/>and has been made available to work in Moodle LMS. Check out the Moodle Docs page at <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Certificates">docs.moodle.org/en/Certificates</a> and the <em class="italic" lang="">Managing certificates</em> section in <a href="B18779_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Configuring Educational Features</em>, for details about <span class="No-Break" lang="">the tool.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">When you browse the plugin page, you will see a link to <strong class="bold" lang="">Source control URL</strong>, which will direct you to the GitHub entry of the plugin. GitHub (now owned by Microsoft) is the de facto standard site for managing <span class="No-Break" lang="">Git repositories.</span></p>

<ol>
<li lang="en-GB">Change to the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">$CFG-&gt;dirroot/admin/tool</strong> directory (this is where admin tools <span class="No-Break" lang="">are stored).</span></li>

The <strong class="bold" lang="">Workplace course certificate</strong> activity (<a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/mod_coursecertificate">moodle.org/plugins/mod_coursecertificate</a>) automatically issues digital certificates to course participants.

<p lang="en-GB">The installation via Git has the advantage that you have a version history and can potentially roll back in case of any problems. A further benefit is that Git commands can be placed in shell scripts to automate plugin maintenance. However, some may find the Git syntax a bit cryptic or the usage of Git overkill. An intuitive alternative to Git is the MOOSH command-line tool, which might work better in <span class="No-Break" lang="">some environments.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Installing plugins via the command line</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>itself <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>does <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>not support the installation of plugins via its CLI, but there is a <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>utility called <strong class="bold" lang="">MOOSH</strong> that does <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>exactly that. You will find the tool in the Moodle plugins database (<a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?id=522">moodle.org/plugins/view.php?id=522</a>). To install MOOSH, extract the downloaded package and set a symbolic link to your <span class="No-Break" lang="">programs folder:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code" lang="en-GB">sudo ln -s $PWD/moosh.php /usr/local/bin/moosh</pre>
<p lang="en-GB">You should <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>now be able to execute MOOSH from the <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>command line. For further <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>installation options, have a look <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://moosh-online.com"><span class="No-Break" lang="">moosh-online.com</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">MOOSH is a bit different; that is, it is not a plugin as such but a command-line tool supporting over 150 commands, two of which are relevant in the context of <span class="No-Break" lang="">installing plugins:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="source-inline" lang="">moosh plugin-list</strong>: This command lists all the plugins (full name, short name, available Moodle versions, and a short description) available at <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins">moodle.org/plugins</a>; it makes sense to apply some filters, such as the module name, since the list <span class="No-Break" lang="">is enormous.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="source-inline" lang="">moosh plugin-install mod_coursecertificate 1</strong>: This command downloads and installs the current version of the <strong class="bold" lang="">Workplace course certificate</strong> activity we mentioned in the previous subsection. It doesn’t get any easier than this! To obtain the version number, use the aforementioned <strong class="source-inline" lang="">plugin-list</strong> command (<strong class="source-inline" lang="">moosh plugin-list | grep "</strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="source-inline" lang="">Course certificate"</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">).</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">You can use the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">config_plugins</strong> command to configure the settings of the plugin. To get an overview of all the plugins installed on your Moodle instance, use the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="source-inline" lang="">info-plugins</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> command.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You will come across MOOSH at various places in this book, and an entire section has been dedicated to the tool in <a href="B18779_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor325"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 17</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Working with Moodle </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Admin Tools</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">So far, we have worked our way through alternative plugin installation procedures. Regular updates are published for most plugins, and the topic of the following subsection is how to keep your add-ons up <span class="No-Break" lang="">to date.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-174" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Keeping plugins up to date</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">One main challenge that Moodle administrators face is to keep plugins up to date. The preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>steps are sufficient for a one-off installation but do not cater to <span class="No-Break" lang="">plugin maintenance.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">How do you know that new plugins are available? You can either be notified automatically by email (go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Server</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Update notifications</strong>, as covered in <span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 1</em></span>, <em class="italic" lang="">Installing Moodle</em>), you can check manually for updates at <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins overview</strong> (see <span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic" lang="">.1</em>), or you can go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Notifications</strong>, where you might see the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following notification:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer233">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.11 – Plugin upgrade required?</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Keeping plugins <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>up to date depends on the installation method you <span class="No-Break" lang="">chose initially:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Web interface</strong>: Go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins overview</strong>, where the <strong class="bold" lang="">Install available updates</strong> button will initiate the update process of any available plugins (download <span class="No-Break" lang="">and installation).</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Manually</strong>: You will have to download the latest version at <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins">moodle.org/plugins</a> and re-install, as <span class="No-Break" lang="">described previously.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Git</strong>: To keep the plugin up to date over time, you will have to create a local module branch of the module that is synchronized with the remote branch on GitHub. You will find detailed instructions on how to do this <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Git_for_Administrators"><span class="No-Break" lang="">docs.moodle.org/en/Git_for_Administrators</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Command line</strong>: All you need to do is rerun the same command you used during installation: <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moosh plugin-install &lt;</strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="source-inline" lang="">plugin&gt; &lt;moodle_version&gt;</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Plugins might become obsolete, or a better alternative might get published. Removing plugins from your Moodle system will be dealt with in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-175" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Uninstalling third-party add-ons</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle plugins usually comprise two parts: the plugin code, located in a subdirectory of <strong class="source-inline" lang="">$CFG-&gt;dirroot</strong>, and data associated with the plugin, located in the database and/or Moodledata. When deleting a plugin, you must ensure that both parts have been removed. If the <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>code is removed, but there is still some data in the database or filesystem, inconsistencies might occur; if the data is gone, but the plugin is still present, it will be re-installed the next time the updater <span class="No-Break" lang="">is initiated.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The removal of a plugin depends again on the installation method you <span class="No-Break" lang="">chose initially:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Web interface</strong>: Go to the <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins overview</strong>, where you must follow the <strong class="bold" lang="">Uninstall</strong> link. Once the deletion has been confirmed, all data associated with the plugin will be removed. To prevent the plugin from re-installing itself, its code must be removed from your server, which can be done by confirming the <span class="No-Break" lang="">second screen.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Manually</strong>: The procedure is the same as the uninstallation via the web interface. The only step unlikely to work is deleting the plugin code from Moodledata due to a lack of permissions. If that is the case, you must remove the folder(s) at the <span class="No-Break" lang="">shell level.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Git</strong>: To remove the plugin code, you have to run the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following command:</span><p class="source-code" lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">git rm &lt;plugin&gt;</strong></p></li>
<li lang="en-GB">While this command keeps your local git repository up to date, it doesn’t remove the data associated with the plugin. As before, you need to do this manually via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Uninstall</strong> option at <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> |<strong class="bold" lang=""> </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins overview</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Command line</strong>: All you need to do is run the MOOSH <strong class="source-inline" lang="">plugin_uninstall</strong> command: <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moosh plugin-uninstall &lt;plugin&gt;</strong>. This command removes both the plugin code and the <span class="No-Break" lang="">plugin data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">You are not tied to a single method for maintaining plugins; you can install an add-on via the command line and remove it manually. The only method that requires consistency is Git, as the repository has to be kept in sync with the code base of your Moodle instance to <span class="No-Break" lang="">avoid inconsistencies.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Deleting an add-on will also irreversibly remove all the user data associated with <span class="No-Break" lang="">the module!</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This concludes <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>the section on managing third-party plugins. The following table provides a summary of the four described plugin management types, highlighting key features <span class="No-Break" lang="">and restrictions:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer234">
<img alt="Figure 8.12 – Plugin management options " height="502" src="image/Figure_8.12_B18779.jpg" width="1386"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.12 – Plugin management options</p>
<p lang="en-GB">So far, we have not distinguished between good and not-so-good plugins, which is the topic of the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following section.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-176" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Good plugins and bad plugins</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Every module <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>that is part of the core of Moodle has gone <a id="_idIndexMarker802"/>through a thorough quality assurance procedure. Moodle has implemented a tight process of accepting third-party plugins to its database. While this practice does not guarantee the add-on’s functionality, security, or integrity, it evaluates the code at a high level. Once this stage has been passed, it will be accepted in the plugin database. The potential problem with third-party add-ons is that you don’t know anything about the quality of <span class="No-Break" lang="">the software.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">While it is possible to uninstall modules if they don’t fit your purpose, you will have to ensure that you don’t put barriers in place for future updates. If an add-on is not maintained correctly, it is unlikely that it’ll be able to support any upcoming versions of Moodle. You will <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>have to delete the module that’s already <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>in use, or you won’t be able to upgrade your system. Also, a module might cater to some required functionality but can compromise your <span class="No-Break" lang="">system’s security.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-177" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Plugin evaluation criteria</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Several criteria <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>indicate whether a plugin is trustworthy or not. They are <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer235">
<img alt="Figure 8.13 – Plugin evaluation criteria " height="664" src="image/Figure_8.13_B18779.jpg" width="1228"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.13 – Plugin evaluation criteria</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The following enumeration provides a brief explanation for each item in <span class="No-Break" lang="">the diagram:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Popularity</strong>: Moodle maintains statistics on usage and downloads, which can be found <a id="_idIndexMarker806"/>in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Stats</strong> tab of each plugin. While there is no guarantee, the more popular a module, the more likely it is to be of a <span class="No-Break" lang="">high standard.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Ratings</strong>: Each <a id="_idIndexMarker807"/>plugin page allows users to mark a plugin as their favorite. Again, there’s no guarantee here, but the more admins who are fans of a plugin, the more likely that this is a <span class="No-Break" lang="">good plugin.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Level of support</strong>: Some of the most valuable third-party add-ons have vanished <a id="_idIndexMarker808"/>because they are unsupported. Your best bet is if a major stakeholder supports the add-on in Moodle, that is, a (Premium) Moodle Partner. The maintainer should have been active in the community during the past <span class="No-Break" lang="">60 days.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Forum posts</strong>: Users <a id="_idIndexMarker809"/>are encouraged to post comments, problems, and praise about each module. Read through the posts to get an idea about what other users have experienced. Be suspicious about modules that are not talked about at all. Also, check whether there are any bad reviews in the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Reviews</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> section.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Documentation</strong>: Each add-on should have a dedicated page in Moodle Docs. It is usually <a id="_idIndexMarker810"/>not a good sign if the page does not exist or is only a wiki stub. Also, it is a good practice if a changelog is kept for the <span class="No-Break" lang="">developed software.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Standalone</strong>: Third-party add-ons mustn’t modify any core code (known as patches <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>supplied in the form of patch files). This restriction is essential as the changes will be overridden with every Moodle update, and the modifications must <span class="No-Break" lang="">be reapplied.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Supported versions</strong>: Support for current and all supported versions of Moodle <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>shows that the software is being actively maintained. You can look at any of the existing versions in the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Versions</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> tab.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Backup and restore support</strong>: If applicable, the add-on should be supported by the <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>course backup and restore facility. Otherwise, what good is an activity if it is not included in <span class="No-Break" lang="">your archives?</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Data privacy</strong>: If the <a id="_idIndexMarker814"/>plugin stores any data, Moodle’s data privacy features (data requests, data registry, and data deletion) must be fully supported. More details can be found in <a href="B18779_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 14</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Complying with Data </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Protection Regulations</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Code</strong>: If you <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>can read PHP code, look at the actual source code of the add-on. Try to find answers to the following questions: Is the code well structured, and can it be easily followed? Is the source code <a id="_idIndexMarker816"/>well commented? Does the module follow the Moodle coding guidelines (<a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Coding">docs.moodle.org/dev/Coding</a>)? Beware if the answer to any of these questions <span class="No-Break" lang="">is no.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Official approval</strong>: Add-ons <a id="_idIndexMarker817"/>stored outside the official Moodle plugin repository, for example, on a developer’s home page, should only be trusted if they come from a <span class="No-Break" lang="">well-known source.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Developer</strong>: Some <a id="_idIndexMarker818"/>developers are known to produce very well-written Moodle add-ons. Programmers affiliated with a (Premium) Moodle Partner are usually a good bet, as are core developers, Moodle documenters, and particularly <span class="No-Break" lang="">helpful Moodlers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Sound quality is a non-negotiable criterion, but many good third-party plugins are still available. We have put together a list of popular plugins to get you started, which you will see in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-178" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Popular plugins</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The following <a id="_idIndexMarker819"/>is a list of some popular third-party Moodle add-ons, available <a id="_idIndexMarker820"/>through the plugin directory at <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins">moodle.org/plugins</a>, alongside brief descriptions (excluding themes and course formats, which we already covered in <a href="B18779_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Enhancing Moodle’s Look </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">and Feel</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">):</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Adminer</strong>: This is a repackaged version of Adminer. Once installed, you will see a new <strong class="bold" lang="">Moodle Adminer</strong> item in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Server</strong> menu. This tool can handle all database-related operations, including creating database <span class="No-Break" lang="">backup dumps.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Attendance</strong>: The plugin allows an attendance log to be kept in blended-learning environments and includes a block for easy access to <span class="No-Break" lang="">relevant functions.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Checklist</strong>: This plugin, containing an activity module and a block, allows teachers <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>to create a checklist to benefit their students. The teacher can monitor all their students’ progress as they tick off each item on the list, and items can be indented and marked as optional. Students are presented with a progress bar, and they can add their private items to <span class="No-Break" lang="">the list.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Completion progress</strong>: This block is a time management tool for students that visually shows what activities and resources a student should interact with within <span class="No-Break" lang="">a course.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Dash</strong>: Dash is an interface and report builder that lets you create flexible course catalogs, team dashboards, and progress reports, <span class="No-Break" lang="">among others.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Level Up</strong>: This provides a great way to add various gamification elements to your Moodle system, supporting (experience) points, (configurable) levels, leaderboards, targets, rewards, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">many more.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Microsoft Office 365</strong>: Microsoft has developed a suite of plugins to allow Microsoft Office 365 usage within Moodle. The set includes logging in via OpenID, access to OneDrive, integration with Office resources, and Outlook <span class="No-Break" lang="">calendar synchronization.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Zoom</strong>: To strengthen our love-hate relationship with Zoom, we can add the plugin to our Moodle instance, as described earlier in this chapter. We will discuss the built-in web conferencing system BigBlueButton in detail in <a href="B18779_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor204"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Configuring </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Technical Features</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>

There are always great new plugins that might be useful for your site. However, before adding every plugin to your site that could be useful to some users sometime in the future, please consider some organizational criteria, which we will <span class="No-Break" lang="">discuss next.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-179" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Organizational decisions around plugins</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Before you <a id="_idIndexMarker822"/>go wild and bombard your Moodle system with dozens of plugins, sit back and reflect on the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following questions:</span></p>

<li lang="en-GB"><em class="italic" lang="">Who is the </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">plugin for?</em></span></li>

<p lang="en-GB">Does the plugin cater to the needs of a wide range of users or only a handful of trainers with very specific needs? Is it a nice-to-have gimmick or a must-have feature? Neither is a problem; just be aware <span class="No-Break" lang="">of this.</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><em class="italic" lang="">What are the requirements of </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">your users?</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">It has proven very useful to gather your staff’s requirements from a representative group of users. Math teachers have needs that are different from language coaches, novices need tools separate from experts, and course authors request features dissimilar to those required by course coordinators. Gather all the requirements first, and then decide which plugins are needed to cater to <span class="No-Break" lang="">the majority.</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><em class="italic" lang="">What is the impact on </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">your users?</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Adding new activities, question types, and course formats is a great way to equip your teachers with new tools to build engaging learning content. However, take into account the skills of your staff and the time they would have to invest in mastering <span class="No-Break" lang="">these add-ons.</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><em class="italic" lang="">What is the impact on </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">your infrastructure?</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Some plugins require access to other systems, for instance, authentication plugins or cloud services. Other plugins rely on a commercial service, for example, video conference tools or plagiarism detection systems. Ensure that the plugin suits your infrastructure and that there is a sustained budget in case regular fees must <span class="No-Break" lang="">be paid.</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><em class="italic" lang="">Is there </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">an alternative?</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Ensure that onboard tools cannot cater to the requirements. If this is not the case, trawl Moodle’s plugin directory for <span class="No-Break" lang="">alternative options.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Be very selective <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>with the plugins you add to your system – the fewer add-ons you have to maintain, the less work and potential hassle you face in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">long term.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-180" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Summary</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">In this chapter, we learned the basics about Moodle plugins. We first provided an overview of plugins, before covering the essentials of managing third-party Moodle add-ons. Plugin management comprised installation, update, and removal; for each operation, we offered four methods: web interface, manual, Git, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">command line.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">After that, we offered some advice on good plugins and not-so-good plugins. We provided some plugin evaluation criteria you might want to apply, presented some popular plugins, and gave you a list of organizational decisions you should take <span class="No-Break" lang="">into account.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You’ve hopefully experienced a flavor of the breadth and depth of additional functionalities available for Moodle. It demonstrates the extensibility and significant benefit of open source software, that is, programmatically enhancing a system to a user’s requirements. The consistent manner in which plugins have been implemented demonstrates the modular architecture of Moodle and flattens the learning curve when additional modules are added in the future and must <span class="No-Break" lang="">be administered.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Now, let’s move on to configuring Moodle plugins. Due to the high volume of available plugins, we divided the topic into two chapters: educational configuration and <span class="No-Break" lang="">technical configuration.</span></p>
