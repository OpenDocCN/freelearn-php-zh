			<p>Nowadays, digital innovation is a challenge for any medium-sized or large organization. This journey, also known as <em class="italic">digital transformation</em>, is not only related to technology but is guided by cultural and motivational pillars. Many managers or communication gurus will tell you that technology is not important and that it's just a commodity or a set of tools at the service of the company (marketing, sales, and suchlike). We believe that this approach is possible only if the technology you have chosen is genuinely able to support your business initiatives. In terms of starting to forget about technical issues and focusing on business only, we have to find a technical solution that works perfectly under all conditions that can scale and support the business as it grows. Following an extended period of research, we have found that this solution is called Pimcore.</p>
			<p>Pimcore, in simple terms, is a technology facilitator that removes most of the operative friction between the mind and the hands of a company. Pimcore can act as a <strong class="bold">PIM (Product Information Management</strong>) system for distributing product information across the entire company or centralize essential data for the company (Master Data Management), allowing all other parties to consume it without any security risk.</p>
			<p>Moreover, Pimcore is a powerful CMS engine that can manage a lot more than simple web pages. It is a very versatile solution that covers most of the problems you encounter every day. In this book, we will learn how to get the best out of Pimcore.</p>
			<p>After reading this book, you will be able to do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You will understand what Pimcore is and how it works. In fact, we believe that it isn't only a matter of which tool to use, but also to incorporate it perfectly into the big picture.</li>
				<li>You will be able to create websites and portals, using Pimcore as a digital experience platform. This includes using the CMS engine, but also creating custom web MVC pages and reusable components.</li>
				<li>You will be able to use the enterprise feature of Pimcore (PIM, DAM, MDM). You will learn how to collect data, incorporate it into a unified database, and share it with all potential consumers (apps, websites, legacy applications, and so on).</li>
				<li>You will be able to install, maintain, and deploy a Pimcore website.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In simple terms, this book will lead you on a journey through theoretical and practical lessons to become a Pimcore developer!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is designed to encourage you to learn about Pimcore in a straightforward manner. We will cover all the important topics to enable you to initiate and complete a real-world project. To reach this goal, we have developed a book that's not only a set of information but something that combines theory and practice. This pragmatic approach will teach you how Pimcore works and how to put your knowledge into practice without getting annoyed or barely being able to follow tutorials by asking you why you need to do that. In fact, the first chapters will introduce you to a high-level vision of Pimcore so that you are aware of all of its benefits, and then we will embark on a journey that will progressively uncover all the details of Pimcore step by step without introducing any excessive complexity. </p>
			<p>This book is designed for any developer, CTO, or any other kind of technician wanting to deliver Pimcore-based solutions or is willing to build digital platforms to support their customers or their business on the digital transformation journey.</p>
			<p>This book gradually introduces the most important concepts, so you do not require any special background. All you need to know in order to understand the book is the basics of the PHP language and some practices involving HTML and CSS.</p>

			<p>Pimcore X comes with many new features and an updated technology stack (Symfony 5, PHP 8, and ExtJS 7) that provides many performance improvements. Even though there are enormous changes between Pimcore X and the previous versions, most of the concepts you will learn reading this book will also be applicable to all the previous versions.</p>

In any case, any developer who has some experience with other platforms will be able to follow the instructions and understand the code.
