Things are not quite so clean cut in reality because while your site's basic setup is, more often than not, easy to implement, the more subtle problem is knowing<span class="emphasis"><em> what</em></span> you want to implement, and<span class="emphasis"><em> how</em></span> you want to implement it in the first place. Discovering what you need from your site is particularly important for precisely this reason, which is why we discussed it right at the start in<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Drupal"> Chapter 1</a>.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Does this mean that you should not start working directly on the site unless you know exactly what you want?</em></span> Not really; like most things, it's a bit of a tradeoff when it comes to starting out with the development of your Drupal website. This is because it is almost impossible to determine exactly what your site will need, and how its functionality should be provided until you have been working with it for some time. Often, you will find yourself modifying the behavior of a site based on feedback from the users.</p><p>At any rate, to get the ball rolling, we are going to need to talk about the following Drupal site configuration topics:<a class="indexterm" id="id76"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">General settings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Error handling</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cache and file system settings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">RSS feed settings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Date settings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Site maintenance</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">String handling</li></ul></div><p>Assuming you have paid close attention to how you want your site to function, and how you visualize it being used, then once your basic settings are complete you should find that the number of changes you have to make down the line are kept to a minimum. Bear in mind though, that changes in Drupal are fairly easy to implement. Don't worry if you have to go back, and change things based on user feedback, or changes to your site in general.</p><div class="section" title="Before We Start"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec01"/>Before We Start</h1></div></div></div><p>It is sensible to make note of one or two important things before getting our hands dirty. For example, you should make it second nature to check how the changes made to the settings in Drupal affect the site. Learning which setting does what and how it alters the behavior of the site is really the goal of this chapter, and while we won't cover each and every little thing in excruciating detail, you will be shown enough to feel confident about your site's general configuration.</p><p>The settings we deal with in this chapter really only affect the site in the broadest sense in that they modify its default behavior—things like what error pages are displayed, or what return email address your site will use. The trickier or more specific settings that apply to a focused area of concern, such as input formats, access rights, or module activation, will be discussed in more detail in the chapters to come.</p><p>Having said that, some of the topics we cover here won't apply to you right at this moment. For example, it is unlikely that you will want to work with RSS feeds right off the bat (although you may well want to work with them a little later on). Feel free to skip any sections that are not of immediate value to you, because you can always come back to them when you need to.</p><p>Also, some of you might be groaning at the prospect of having to plow through setting after setting in order to get everything just as you want it. Of course, creating a flashy new theme would probably be more exciting, but taking the time to look through and play with all the available settings is an important step towards becoming a competent Drupal administrator. Not only will you learn how to get things done, but also what things can in fact be done. Believe me, with software as flexible and powerful as Drupal, there is a surprising amount on offer.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>So what are we going to be looking at precisely?</em></span> If you log in as the administrator, and navigate to<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span>, and then<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span>, you should see something like the following page brought up:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Before We Start" src="graphics/1800_03_01.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see there are plenty of options to deal with (from the sheer number of links presented on this page), and we will start, throughout this chapter, by working our way down the links provided on the right-hand side of the page. Throughout the course of the book, we will end up covering each and every item under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> main-menu link.<a class="indexterm" id="id77"/>
</p><p>Some of you may have realized that cron jobs were not mentioned in the introduction as something that is covered in this chapter despite the fact that they are present in the settings page, as shown in the screenshot above. The reason for this is that dealing with cron jobs or scheduled tasks is more of a site administration task instead of a specifically Drupal-oriented one. Because of this, everything you need to know about cron jobs is covered in<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Running Your Website"> Chapter 10</a> on Running Your Website instead.</p><p>Now, it won't always be possible to discuss each setting in order because often Drupal requires us to make settings in several different places in order to effect certain changes. However, this will all seem far less daunting once we have gone through the entire menu, and you are more familiar with how things work.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="General Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec02"/>General Settings</h1></div></div></div><p>This page contains a mixed bag of settings, some of which are pretty self explanatory while others will require us to think quite carefully about what we need to do. To start with, we are presented with a few text boxes that control things like the name of the site, the mission statement, and so on. For the demo site, the following settings were entered for the first six options:<a class="indexterm" id="id78"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="General Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_02.jpg"/></div><p>On the face of it, we are pretty much set here. There isn't anything complex about these settings, and it should be fine to move on with the next lot; or should we check first? It is important to remember that before we continue it is always wise to use the site to ensure whatever modifications have been made have the desired effect.</p><p>After saving the aforementioned changes, the demo site now looks like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="General Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_03.jpg"/></div><p>Hmm, this is not ideal! For a start, we seem to be missing our slogan entirely, and the hard hitting poetry we added in the<span class="strong"><strong> Footer message</strong></span> section isn't being displayed in the format we want it either. What's going on? As you can see, things are not always as straightforward as they seem. The reason the slogan is not displayed is because some themes don't display a slogan at all (or simply have the slogan disabled by default), and the reason that the footer has not come out in poetry format is because we haven't told Drupal to format it as such.<a class="indexterm" id="id79"/>
</p><p>Oh dear, it looks like we have already run into problems that, with the information we have at hand, cannot be easily solved. The answer here is to be patient and wait until we have dealt with various other configuration settings and themes in some detail as this will help us to understand how we can modify the actual presentation of the site with a greater level of sophistication.</p><p>That's not to say we are entirely without tricks up our sleeve. Bear in mind that Drupal will format HTML (HyperText Markup Language) if you enter it into the text boxes. So, if instead of the original<span class="strong"><strong> Footer message</strong></span> text, we entered something like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;</strong></span>
So tell your children fairy tales,&lt;br /&gt;
as the tears fall on the page,<span class="strong"><strong>&lt;br /&gt;</strong></span>
when we killed what made us human,<span class="strong"><strong>&lt;br /&gt;</strong></span>
to embrace an empty age.
<span class="strong"><strong>&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The footer message would then appear on the site as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="General Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_04.jpg"/></div><p>This is far more suitable for our purposes since the text is both poetry, and a quote (hence the italics) from a poem called<span class="emphasis"><em> The Vanishing</em></span>.</p><p>For some of you, this may present a bit of a problem because you are unfamiliar with HTML. If at this stage you have little to no knowledge of HTML, then you might find it worthwhile teaching yourself a little bit about it before you continue on—if so, jump ahead to the section on<span class="emphasis"><em> HTML, PHP, and Content Posting</em></span> in<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced Content"> Chapter 7</a>, for more information on this.</p><p>Moving along we see that we also have the option of defining a name for anonymous users. This is fine as it is, but feel free to change this if you have a compelling reason for doing so. The only thing this will do is change the credited name of a posting from<span class="strong"><strong> Anonymous</strong></span> to whatever you have set (assuming you allow anonymous users to post any content to the site). Let's take a look at the remaining settings in this section before going into an explanation of them:<a class="indexterm" id="id80"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="General Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_05.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, we have changed the<span class="strong"><strong> Default front page</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> node/2</strong></span>.<span class="emphasis"><em> But what does changing this setting do?</em></span> Well, let's assume that there is a page of content that you would like to be displayed as the default page of your website—before anyone views any of the other content. For example, if you wanted to display some sort of promotional information or an introduction page, you could tell Drupal to display that using this setting. In this case, the second node has been stipulated as the default front page—remember that you have to create the content for this post first, and then determine its ID before you can tell Drupal to use it.<a class="indexterm" id="id81"/>
</p><p>It is probably best that you leave this as is for the moment, until we have discussed how to add content. If you are keen on getting something posted to the site, simply use the<span class="strong"><strong> create content</strong></span> link at the top of the menu and follow the instructions there. You should be able to get something up and running fairly easily. The important thing about content as it relates to this section, however, is that you need to know the ID of the node you want to specify as the default front page.<a class="indexterm" id="id82"/>
</p><p>This is easy if you bear the following in mind:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"/>Note</h3><p>Whenever you edit content, the ID of the node being edited will appear in the URL.</p></div></div><p>We are not finished yet, because it is possible to specify several options depending on what you require for your front page. In this case, the specific node with identity number<code class="literal"> 2</code> has been chosen, but if you prefer your site's blogs to be displayed you could substitute<span class="strong"><strong> node/2</strong></span> (in node/ID format) for<span class="strong"><strong> blog</strong></span>, and a list of the blogs would be shown by default.</p><p>A good way to determine exactly how to display the front page you want is to actually browse to the page you want on your site. This could be your blog page, your aggregated news feed (more about feeds later in the book), or whatever. Once you are looking at what you want, take note of the<span class="strong"><strong> relative URL path</strong></span> and simply enter that into the text box provided.</p><p>The relative URL path is that part of the page's address that comes after the standard domain, which is shared by the whole site. For example, in this case, setting<code class="literal"> node/2</code> works because Drupal maps this relative path to:<a class="indexterm" id="id83"/>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">http://localhost/drupal/<span class="strong"><strong>node/2</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The first part of this address,<code class="literal"> http://localhost/drupal/</code> is the<span class="strong"><strong> base URL</strong></span> (recall that you specified this in the previous chapter when configuring Drupal), and everything after that is the relative URL path.</p><p>Make sure, however, that everything works properly before moving on. Setting file paths can sometimes be a pain because it is easy to make a mistake and add an erroneous slash here and there—if you're like me, that is.</p><p>You can also display content by category by simply entering the correct relative URL path along with the category's ID number—this will require us to learn about how to work with categories before this is of any use, so it is left as an exercise. For the time being the default page of the site now looks like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="General Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_06.jpg"/></div><p>So far so good, but what did the final setting mean? Many of you may have noticed that whenever you make a request to Drupal, the URL of the page you are taken to looks something like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">http://localhost/drupal/?q=node/add
</pre></div><p>This is the default form of URLs in Drupal, and it is unfortunate because obviously the<code class="literal"> ?q=</code> is not very attractive. Worse it may interfere with your site being indexed by search engines. Accordingly, you can remove this from your URLs by enabling the<span class="strong"><strong> Clean URLs</strong></span> option. In order for this to work you must have the Apache<code class="literal"> mod_rewrite</code> module enabled (this can be set in the<code class="literal"> httpd.conf</code> file in your Apache installation). If you have installed Apache2Triad then this should already be the case, but when it comes to deploying your site to your live host you must ensure that they too have it enabled, otherwise you will have to disable<span class="strong"><strong> Clean URLs</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id84"/>
</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Error Handling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec03"/>Error Handling</h1></div></div></div><p>This section allows you to broadly deal with the problem of errors that may crop up (hopefully not that often). In particular, you may wish to create a couple of customized error pages that will be displayed to your users in the event of a<span class="emphasis"><em> page not found or access denied</em></span> problem. Remember that there are already pretty concise pages, which are supplied by default, but should you wish to make any changes, then the process is the same as defining a default page for the site as shown in the previous section. Create the content that will be displayed—an example is shown here for the<span class="emphasis"><em> page not found</em></span> error:<a class="indexterm" id="id85"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Error Handling" src="graphics/1800_03_07.jpg"/></div><p>Now, we simply determine the unique ID of this post by clicking<span class="strong"><strong> Submit</strong></span>, and then looking at the URL displayed in the address bar on the following page—in this case, the ID of the page is 5. Bashing up a similar page for the<span class="emphasis"><em> access denied</em></span> error, and providing Drupal with its ID completes the error page handling. So whenever something goes wrong, the user gets a nice friendly message and the chance to email the staff directly.<a class="indexterm" id="id86"/>
</p><p>Please bear in mind that while we will cover adding, removing, and manipulating content in great detail in Chapters 6 and 7, you might find it useful to know at this stage that you can select the<span class="strong"><strong> input format</strong></span> whenever you add content by using this drop-down list on the content addition page (useful if you need to do something fairly advanced with your posting):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Error Handling" src="graphics/1800_03_08.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see I have the default option of<span class="strong"><strong> Filtered HTML</strong></span> that allows me to enter some HTML code, and no PHP code.<span class="emphasis"><em>"Why would they have several options like this?"</em></span>, you might ask. We will discuss the reasons for this in more detail later on. For now, it is best to stick to<span class="strong"><strong> Filtered HTML</strong></span> unless you have a specific need to add PHP code, or HTML tags that are otherwise not allowed.<a class="indexterm" id="id87"/>
</p><p>The next option,<span class="strong"><strong> Error reporting</strong></span>, allows you to decide whether to write errors to the screen as well as to the error log. While you are busy building the site, you will probably find it useful to select<span class="strong"><strong> Write errors to the log and to the screen</strong></span>, so that you can determine what has gone wrong and when. However, once it is time to go live you should change this to<span class="strong"><strong> Write errors to the log</strong></span> (seen in the drop‑down list), as you don't want everyone to be able to read the system's various errors as this may divulge information to malicious users who might be able to use it in an attack on your site.<a class="indexterm" id="id88"/>
</p><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Error handling</strong></span> section now looks something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Error Handling" src="graphics/1800_03_09.jpg"/></div><p>The final option shown in this screenshot lets you decide how long to keep logged messages. You will probably have to find your way as you go when it comes to making this choice, as it really depends on how busy you are, and how busy the site is. When in doubt, leave it as the default as this is a broadly sensible option.</p><p>You will need to use the crontab in order to enforce this setting, and in case mentioning cron jobs at this point has made things as clear as mud, it is important to understand the following:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"/>Note</h3><p>Cron jobs (on Windows, these are known as scheduled tasks) are simply batches of commands that are run at specific times depending on how often you set them to run. The crontab allows you to stipulate various jobs, and the intervals at which they are to be executed.</p></div></div><p>As soon as you need to work with the<code class="literal"> cron.php</code> script, which controls all the cron-related tasks on your Drupal site, flip over to the<span class="emphasis"><em> Cron and Scheduled Tasks</em></span> section in<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Running Your Website"> Chapter 10</a>.</p><p>Once you are happy that you have set your cron jobs appropriately, you can be sure that your automated tasks will be handled by the cron script. That aside, let's take a look and see the new settings from this section in action. For example, I attempted to access a page that did not exist. As expected, the following friendly message appeared:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Error Handling" src="graphics/1800_03_10.jpg"/></div><p>An important point to note is that you should remember to check your logs on a regular basis as part of your overall strategy to ensure that the site continues to run smoothly. Error messages, warnings, and so on, are effectively a window into the operations of the site, and are an indispensable tool.<a class="indexterm" id="id89"/>
</p><p>In order to take a look at your logs, simply click<span class="strong"><strong> logs</strong></span> under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item, and you will be presented with a list of all the events that have taken place on your site. You can filter these events by selecting an option in the drop-down list under the heading<span class="strong"><strong> Filter by message type</strong></span>, and then clicking<span class="strong"><strong> Filter</strong></span>. If you want to look at the details of any error report, simply click the link found under the<span class="strong"><strong> Message</strong></span> column, and the details of the log report will be displayed, much like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Error Handling" src="graphics/1800_03_11.jpg"/></div><p>That wraps it up for error handling for now. Of course, it is important to realize that this type of error handling does not deal with errors or bugs that may be within the actual source code or file system of your website. In other words, this type of<span class="emphasis"><em> error handling</em></span> is not to be confused with<span class="emphasis"><em> bugs</em></span> within the application, it is simply there to deal with the functioning of the site as it pertains to serving pages. If you come across a bug in your system then you will need to attempt to repair the problem, failing which you can look to the Drupal community for help.<a class="indexterm" id="id90"/>
</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Cache and File System Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec04"/>Cache and File System Settings</h1></div></div></div><p>A cache is a storage place where web pages can be held for quick access by the server, without the need to build them from scratch each time. Obviously, this can speed up a site significantly if it is providing pages that require large data retrievals each time. The problem is that a cached page serves an old version of the page, and not the most recent one. This is no problem if you are working with pages which only change once in a while, but if it's important that users are able to see the latest version of a page each time it is requested, then you should not use caching.<a class="indexterm" id="id91"/>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>So when do we not need caching?</em></span> For a start, there is no need to use it while you are building your site, because any changes you make while you are setting things up may not display until the cache is flushed—this can lead to no small amount of confusion when you are expecting a change to manifest itself on a page. Accordingly, you should only really enable page caching just before your site is ready to go live in order to test that it works correctly.</p><p>The second setting in the<span class="strong"><strong> Cache settings</strong></span> section,<span class="strong"><strong> Minimum cache lifetime</strong></span>, determines how long Drupal holds a page in its cache. This is really determined by the nature of your content, and you should be able to work out what is best for your site depending on how quickly the content changes, and how much it is used. If you set the cache to be refreshed every minute, then you can be sure that all content on your site is at most a minute old because the page is refreshed every minute after it is called. A setting of one day means that content might be up to a day old. The longer the cache is held, the better the site's performance, but the more dated the content becomes. Obviously, for registered users or site administrators it is important to be able to view the latest version of each page, so:<a class="indexterm" id="id92"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"/>Note</h3><p>Only pages accessed by<span class="emphasis"><em> anonymous</em></span> users are cached!</p></div></div><p>How you deal with file system settings really depends on what type of content you visualize your site using. It is recommended that you set the<span class="strong"><strong> Download method</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> Private</strong></span> straight away, so that you can control file downloads properly from the start. If you know that all files will always be available for anyone to download on your site, then leave it as is.<a class="indexterm" id="id93"/>
</p><p>Assuming you<span class="emphasis"><em> do</em></span> want to make your download method private, then you will need to move the<code class="literal"> files</code> directory out of the document root so that it is not directly available over the Web. If you do this, you need to enter the<span class="emphasis"><em> fully-qualified</em></span> file path to this folder instead of the<span class="emphasis"><em> relative</em></span> path, because otherwise Drupal will try to find it in the normal place. For example, on the demo site's development machine, the following file path was entered with the<span class="strong"><strong> Private Download method</strong></span> selected:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">C:\apache2triad\files
</pre></div><p>As well as this, ensure that the<code class="literal"> temp</code> directory set is sensible, which in the case of the demo site is<code class="literal"> C:\apache2triad\temp</code>.</p><p>Before we continue though, we should make sure that we can upload a file to the site without any problems. In order to do this, go to the<span class="strong"><strong> modules</strong></span> section under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span>, enable the<span class="strong"><strong> upload</strong></span> option (found at the bottom of the list of modules), and click<span class="strong"><strong> Save configuration</strong></span>. Now when you attempt to<span class="strong"><strong> create content</strong></span>, you are presented with the following<span class="strong"><strong> File attachments</strong></span> option to go with the actual content:<a class="indexterm" id="id94"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Cache and File System Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_12.jpg"/></div><p>Once the file has been uploaded, you will see something like the following confirmation message:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Cache and File System Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_13.jpg"/></div><p>The new table shown below<span class="strong"><strong> File attachments</strong></span> in the previous figure has four columns:<a class="indexterm" id="id95"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Delete</strong></span>, which gives you the option to delete the attachment from the post</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>List</strong></span>, which lists the uploaded file in the attachment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Description</strong></span>, which is the name of the file</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span>, which is the size of the uploaded file</li></ul></div><p>In this case, the file uploaded is an image and weighs in at 2.45KB. If you are attaching files in order to display them within a page you will need to ensure that they are fairly small. Incidentally, if you do choose to list your attachment, by selecting the<span class="strong"><strong> List</strong></span> option, then it will appear in the post as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Cache and File System Settings" src="graphics/1800_03_14.jpg"/></div><p>Users can simply click the link to upload the file. Obviously, if you are attaching the file to your post so that you can display it from within the page, then you probably want to disable the<span class="strong"><strong> List</strong></span> option. For more information on file attachments head on over to<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced Content"> Chapter 7</a>, which deals with<span class="emphasis"><em> Advanced Content</em></span>.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="RSS Feed Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec05"/>RSS Feed Settings</h1></div></div></div><p>At some stage in the future you may wish to make use of some of the multitude of RSS feeds available on the Web. When this time comes, you will need to make a few choices about how these will be presented on your website. The options presented in this section allow you to control how many feeds per page you wish to display, and whether you would like to show the title alone, the title plus a teaser, or the entire feed. These options are pretty straightforward and won't affect anything as it stands for the moment.<a class="indexterm" id="id96"/>
</p><p>We will take a closer look at RSS feeds (including a discussion on what they are) when we work with the feed aggregator in<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Basic Content"> Chapter 6</a>.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Date Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec06"/>Date Settings</h1></div></div></div><p>Everything in this section is fairly straightforward and concerns the date and time values, and formats shown on the site. Select your default time zone according to your local time—for example, the demo site is two hours ahead of GMT.<a class="indexterm" id="id97"/>
</p><p>Following this you can decide whether users should be allowed to set their own time zones according to their location. By default, this is set to<span class="strong"><strong> Enabled</strong></span>, which is fairly sensible unless you happen to know that the vast majority of your users will be from a fairly small geographic location. For example, if you are running a community site for your local SPCA in Wyoming, then it is unlikely that the site will have members in Kinshasa, and so the<span class="strong"><strong> Configurable time zones</strong></span> option can be disabled.</p><p>Following on from this, there is a set of options pertaining to the format of the date and time displayed on the site, and you should select the ones that agree with the majority of the site's intended users, or alternatively, the site's locality. Nothing too life threatening in there, and you can always make modifications at a later date if a change is necessary.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Site Maintenance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec07"/>Site Maintenance</h1></div></div></div><p>The developers of Drupal should be given a pat on the back for making your life easier than that of most other website administrators by providing you with the site maintenance facility. Before we discuss it though, I should make the following point very clear:<a class="indexterm" id="id98"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"/>Note</h3><p>All major development or changes to your site should be performed on the development machine and thoroughly tested before being implemented or ported to the live site.</p></div></div><p>There will be times, however, when you simply have to make some changes directly to the live site—even if it is only to implement upgrades that have already been tested out on the development server. If this is the case, then rather than allow users to work on a site under maintenance, you can simply switch the<span class="strong"><strong> Site status</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> Off-line</strong></span>, and get on with your work.<a class="indexterm" id="id99"/>
</p><p>You can also add a simple message explaining why the site is currently offline so that when a user attempts to access the site they see something like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Site Maintenance" src="graphics/1800_03_15.jpg"/></div><p>Having this facility will make life easy for you in the event that you do have to perform some sort of major work on the site. But be very careful when working on this, because if you log out, then you have just locked yourself out of the site. This is because only user 1 (that is the administrative user) can do anything on the site while it is offline. If you log off and try logging on again, you are no longer the administrative user; you are instead anonymous.</p><p>This is not very helpful if you do happen to be the site administrator; so Drupal allows the login page to be accessed as normal. Navigate to<code class="literal"> http://localhost/drupal/user</code>, and you will be able to log in as the administrator and use the site without hindrance. Very important:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"/>Note</h3><p>Make certain you do not forget your administrator's password when setting the site's status to<span class="strong"><strong> Off‑line!</strong></span>
</p></div></div><p>Everyone else is locked out until the site's status is returned to<span class="strong"><strong> Online</strong></span>.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="String Handling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec08"/>String Handling</h1></div></div></div><p>At present there is no option for you to consider here, other than educating yourself on the Unicode string handling facilities in place. Drupal makes use of the<span class="strong"><strong> PHP mbstring extension</strong></span>, which is not enabled by default. Provided you ensure that the live host has this extension enabled, Drupal will faithfully support multi-byte Unicode operations allowing your site to cater to some pretty far out characters in any language you like.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec09"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter has covered a fair amount of ground in terms of setting up the site. We began by looking at some general configuration settings that are important in terms of getting the nuts and bolts in working order. Many of these settings will need to be revisited as the site develops, and as you become more adventurous.</p><p>However, you have learned some valuable information about where to go, and what's available when you need to deal with the site's overall well-being. From error handling to site maintenance, you should now be able to work with Drupal with some confidence.</p><p>It is worthwhile noting that with the standard Drupal configuration, there are also related technologies that are useful to know. In this instance, taking time out to learn a bit of HTML will definitely help to get your content nicely organized, and displayed on the site. Not only will this be of benefit now (and most definitely later on in the development phase), but it is an important tool to have when working with the Web in general.</p><p>Of course, if you are feeling up to it, a good understanding of PHP will also help! Take some time to browse over the PHP website at<a class="ulink" href="http://www.php.net"> http://www.php.net  </a>  to learn a bit more about the language.</p></div></body></html>
