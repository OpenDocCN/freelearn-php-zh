- en: This book provides a 360-degree overview of what it takes to design and build
    a performant application with Laravel Octane, why you should, and how to do it.
    This book also covers the different tools used by Laravel Octane, such as Swoole
    and RoadRunner, and lists and explains the various features and differentiating
    elements. But the most important thing is that it will enable you to understand
    why and when to use Swoole or RoadRunner.

- en: This book is for those Laravel developers who already know the fundamentals
    of the framework, such as routing mechanisms, controllers, services, and models.
    It is meant for those developers who would like to design their applications in
    a more scalable way and make them more performant.

    Web Application Architecture*, is where Laravel Octane introduces new features,
    but more importantly a new way of thinking about how to design high-performance
    Laravel applications.'

    Application Server*, shows us a scenario where Laravel Octane is based on the
    RoadRunner application server. RoadRunner is a very fast and effective application
    server that is easy to install. Because of its simplicity, it allows the user
    to approach Laravel Octane easily and straightforwardly.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17728_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048), *Configuring the Swoole Application
    Server*, shows us a scenario where Laravel Octane is based on the Swoole application
    server. Running Swoole as an application server allows the developer to use some
    advanced features, such as managing multiple workers and concurrent tasks, bootstrapping
    the application more efficiently, fast caching, and sharing data among workers.
    Laravel Octane uses Swoole, so it is important to have clear ideas about the opportunities
    that arise from using these application servers.'

    Data with an Asynchronous Approach*, teaches us that, once the developer has sped
    up the bootstrapping of the framework and has removed bottlenecks on the request
    side, they have to reduce latency in other parts of the application. The chapter
    introduces useful techniques to reduce latency in executing tasks and managing
    data.'

    Asynchronous Approach in Your Application*, teaches us that in addition to the
    various tools available with application servers, we can add extra components
    to our application architecture. One of the main tools to go alongside application
    servers for greater scalability of a solution is queuing mechanisms. This chapter
    shows what the benefits are of adding a queuing mechanism to our application.'
