<p>At this stage, you already know how versatile WordPress is when it comes to the range of designs you can have on your site—all because of themes. However, just getting a theme and using it as is isn't necessarily the most optimized approach. Therefore, in this chapter, we're going to take it up a notch<span>—</span>you'll learn how to customize your theme and make your website look exactly as you want it to.</p>
<p>We'll start by discussing how to manage navigation menus and work with the basic layout customization features to further enhance the capabilities of your entire website. Then, we'll talk about widgets and how to use them to make your sidebars even more functional and reader-friendly. We'll cover the topic of WordPress Customizer, and what it can do for your overall website presentation. Lastly, we'll talk about Google AMP and how to make sure that your site is more than optimized to be viewed on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the topics we'll dive into in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menus</li>
<li>Widgets</li>
<li>WordPress Customizer</li>
<li>Optimizing for mobile and working with AMP</li>

<p>Menus serve a very important role for any website's ease of navigation and helping readers find things. A classic website menu is one displayed near the top of the page, listing individual sub-pages that are part of the website. Those very often are pages such as <em>About</em>, and <em>Contact</em>. Under the hood, menus are just simple lists of links that point to different areas within your website.</p>
<p>It just so happens that WordPress handles menus in a very user-friendly way. You can easily create menus featuring links to pages, posts, category archives, and even arbitrary links to any URL. And when you're done configuring the menu itself, you can add it to be displayed in your design/theme.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the menus management screen.</p>
<ol>
<li>To get there, just navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Menus</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/8e00f5c1-094a-491c-a588-655dcb48ea5f.png" width="1322" height="877"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To create your first menu, enter a title (for example, <em>Main</em>) where it says <span class="packt_screen">Menu Name</span>, and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Create Menu</span>.</li>
<li>After doing so, you can select individual <em>pages</em> from the panel on the left and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add to Menu</span> button to confirm:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a9eaa5a6-34ae-41b5-b294-1505f294386f.png" style="width:16.33em;height:21.75em;" width="432" height="573"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If you want to add specific blog posts to the menu, you can do that too. Just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> heading in the panel and then pick the exact post you want to link to. To confirm, click on <span class="packt_screen">Add to Menu</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/eec8e467-8d11-471a-b1dd-b1e977ad392a.png" style="width:16.75em;height:27.83em;" width="431" height="719"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You can add some custom links to the menu as well. This can be done after clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Custom Links</span> heading on the left and then filling out the required link information. To confirm, click on <span class="packt_screen">Add to Menu</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c836dad5-941d-45a1-a9d0-4608ccd68cf5.png" style="width:17.33em;height:20.08em;" width="430" height="500"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Next, you can add some category links. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span> heading on the left and then proceed to click on the checkboxes next to the categories you want to include. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Add to Menu</span> to confirm:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6120089a-6179-4eb5-98df-1272c319adf7.png" style="width:15.25em;height:24.00em;" width="365" height="574"/></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Finally, be sure to click on <span class="packt_screen">Save Menu</span> in the upper-right corner. The following is what my new menu looks like now:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b6924144-1a1b-4560-a11d-d00413ebed88.png" style="width:45.08em;height:29.92em;" width="987" height="654"/></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>You can also drag items to the right to make them sub items of the item immediately above. For example, I'll drag one of my posts as a sub item under the <span class="packt_screen">Recipes</span> category. Now, my menu looks like the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9cc0eef1-2fd2-4d1f-9fda-ec731e8a06c5.png" style="width:28.17em;height:12.67em;" width="567" height="255"/></p>
<p>You can make more menus by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Create a new menu</span> link at the top and repeating the process.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask: <em>I created my new menu, but how do I make it show up on my site?</em></p>

<p>If you have a menu-enabled theme (which you probably do), then, once you have one menu, a new box will appear on the <span class="packt_screen">Menus</span> page showing you the menu locations. <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span> has three menu locations, and they're named <span class="packt_screen">Primary</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Footer Menu</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Social Links Menu</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c1c72197-c154-46d4-a437-75a4f016b738.png" style="width:35.92em;height:11.08em;" width="657" height="204"/></p>
<p>All you have to do to assign your newly created menu to the predefined menu area in <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span>, is to check one of the boxes, as shown in the preceding screenshot. Right now, my primary navigation on the website looks like the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9128adf0-9083-4c00-b287-a6f1c323fb1b.png" style="width:22.75em;height:3.58em;" width="650" height="104"/></p>
<p>When I click on the down arrow next to <span class="packt_screen">Recipes</span>, I will also see my other post that was saved as a sub item, as shown in the next screenshot. <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span> displays sub items in a rollover menu:</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Widgets</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Widgets are one of the native mechanisms in WordPress. Their main purpose is to provide us with an easy-to-use way of customizing the sidebars, footers, and headers of our sites, with the addition of extra content. Even though the most common placement of widgets is indeed the sidebar, the only actual rule is that a widget must be displayed inside a <em>widget area, a</em>nd a widget area can be anywhere a theme developer wants it to be. Common widgets contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A monthly archive of blog posts</li>
<li>A clickable list of pages</li>
<li>A clickable list of recent posts</li>
<li>A metadata box (containing logon/logutout links, RSS feed links, and other WordPress links)</li>
<li>Recent comments posted on the blog</li>
<li>A clickable list of categories</li>
<li>A tag cloud</li>
<li>A block of text and HTML</li>
<li>A search box</li>
</ul>
<p>These days, nearly all themes are widget-enabled, with one or more widget areas available for use. If I were to simplify this a bit, I'd say that widget areas behave like locations for menus.</p>
<p>To control the widgets on your new website, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Widgets</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span> comes with just one widget area. It's called <span class="packt_screen">Footer</span><span class="packt_screen">,</span> as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0a053f27-d2cf-4b1f-97a6-168edbb0f72a.png" style="width:41.67em;height:38.50em;" width="934" height="863"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>As the name indicates, this widget area appears in the footer of the site. The way you work with widgets is very simple. The only thing you have to do is take any of the widgets visible on the left-hand side and drag and drop them into the right-hand area under any of the available widget areas. For example, let's take the <span class="packt_screen">Navigation Menu</span> block and drag it all the way to <span class="packt_screen">Footer</span>. The result is as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a279d0ce-e401-40ff-86bc-966d3e298a35.png" style="width:25.92em;height:22.08em;" width="527" height="450"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now, we can give this block a title and also use the dropdown to select the custom menu we want to include in this widget. Currently, there's only one menu, which we created a while ago, <span class="packt_screen">Main</span>. Once we click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button (visible in the preceding screenshot), our menu is going to be added in place.</li>
<li>At this point, we have the main menu displayed twice on the site. There's one in the top area, and the second one is inside the footer. As you can see, if you want to place a menu somewhere on the site, you have two ways of doing so. You can either assign it inside the <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Menus</span> section, or use it as a navigation menu widget and place it in any widget area that your theme supports.</li>
<li>Enabling any other type of widget is very similar to the process described just now. All you need to do is drag the widget you like and drop it onto the area where you want to have it displayed. Then, once the widget is in place, you can adjust its settings and content.</li>
<li>When it comes to working in the <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Widgets</span> section, you can click on the little down arrow to the right of any widget to expand the details and see the options. You can drag a new widget in from the collection of available widgets on the left, you can drag existing widgets up and down to change their order, and you can delete a widget by expanding it and then clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Delete</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Experiment with putting widgets into different widget areas and then refresh your blog to see what they look like. Always be sure to click on <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> if you make any changes to a widget.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Also, at the bottom of the screen, there's one more section labeled <span class="packt_screen">Inactive Widgets</span>, as shown in the following screenshot. Many widgets have their settings and parameters. Therefore, even if you don't want to display a particular widget on your site at the moment, but don't necessarily want to lose its settings (in case you'd like to use the widget again in the future), this section is where you put it. Just like the label says, it's where you can drag your widgets to remove them from display but keep their settings. This is also where you will find any widgets that were previously active, but that got deactivated automatically after switching to a theme that didn't use the same widget area naming convention:</li>
</ol>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">WordPress Customizer</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Yet another feature in WordPress that's highly dependent on your theme is the <span class="packt_screen">Customizer</span> module. If you still have the welcome box enabled in your Dashboard's screen settings, you can access this module by clicking on the big <span class="packt_screen">Customize Your Site</span> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/29913e63-dfe8-49eb-8def-9c39a4d4da47.png" style="width:55.08em;height:15.42em;" width="1217" height="341"/></p>
<p>Another way of accessing this module is by visiting <kbd>http://yoursite.com/wp-admin<br/>
/customize.php</kbd>. This is what you'll see (provided you're working with the default theme):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/d1cc6dea-3d87-4ef2-9c33-f95fd7f3801b.png" style="width:53.92em;height:29.25em;" width="1740" height="944"/></p>
<p>By going through the individual tabs on the left, you can adjust various aspects of your site<span>—</span>some that we've already talked about in this chapter, as well as some that are completely new. We're going to look through them here. The customizations that are available in most themes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Site Identity</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Colors</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Header Media</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Menus</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Widgets</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Homepage Settings / Static Front Page</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Additional CSS</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The best thing about this module is that it provides a live preview, which makes editing the basic aspects of your design much quicker. When you're done, you can click on either the <span class="packt_screen">X</span> button or the <span class="packt_screen">Save &amp; Publish</span> button that are visible in the top-left corner.</p>
<p>Before we get into the individual sections of the Customizer, let's have a glance at those curious-looking pencil icons in various parts of the interface. You can see an example in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a1c7de0c-daf6-4278-8f60-7f357ecfedd4.png" style="width:56.42em;height:11.50em;" width="1362" height="277"/></p>
<p>In a nutshell, those are shortcut icons. Meaning, they get displayed next to specific interface elements that can be edited within the Customizer. So, instead of having to search for a given customization in the left sidebar, you can simply click on the shortcut icon corresponding to it, and you will be immediately taken to the correct options panel. For example, if you click on the site's title, you will be taken to the exact section where you can edit it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/fc9c359d-061c-4d74-be6a-26bf151f2a16.png" style="width:43.25em;height:13.83em;" width="1365" height="437"/></p>
<p>We'll explore the options one by one as we go through the Customizer.</p>

    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Site identity</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span class="packt_screen">Site Identity</span> is the first block that's available in the Customizer's sidebar:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/2d74ea09-b769-4080-ac45-861524228591.png" style="width:19.17em;height:32.08em;" width="407" height="681"/></p>
<p>When you click on it, you will be able to adjust things such as the site's <span class="packt_screen">Logo</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Site Title</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Tagline</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Site Icon</span>. What needs to be said here, however, is that the effect all those options have on your site depends greatly on your current theme. For example, one theme will display the logo in a completely different place than the other, and the same can be said for the site title, and so on. It's therefore always a good idea to experiment with the settings there, and find out on your own what effect they have. Under the hood, the options we're dealing with here are just standard input fields and image/media selection panels. This is everything that we have already covered in the previous chapters of this book</p>
<p>The one element that usually works the same for most WordPress themes is the <span class="packt_screen">Site Icon</span> setting. A site icon is this small icon that's visible in the corner of your web browser window. For instance, if you go to this book publisher's website, at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">https://www.packtpub.com/</a>, you will see the site icon presented in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/4fef2577-8a3a-414a-b017-722ffd07feec.png" style="width:24.33em;height:3.00em;" width="614" height="77"/></p>
<p>Overall, site icons are a nice way of giving your website some visual representation in the visitor's web browser, so that they can identify it more easily when having a handful of browser tabs open at the same time. You can pick your site icon easily by selecting it through the Customizer. The currently recommended image dimensions for the icon are at least 512 pixels wide and tall.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The second section in the Customizer sidebar is labeled <span class="packt_screen">Colors</span>. In it, you can pick one of the current theme's predefined color schemes for the site. The <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span> theme has two options there, as seen in the following screenshot. Furthermore, there's also an additional setting to define whether the primary color will have an effect on your pages' or posts' featured images (play around with it to see the effect yourself):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/2b55f9c3-5650-4faf-8d79-8808c1d1a8e1.png" style="width:21.25em;height:12.00em;" width="391" height="221"/></p>
<p>Changing from <span class="packt_screen">Default</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Custom</span> switches the site design from white background colors to whatever you want them to be. If you click on <span class="packt_screen">Custom</span>, you get to use a color picker to adjust some of the colors used in the design in a more freehand way.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Header Media</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span class="packt_screen">Header Media</span> is another popular section in the Customizer sidebar. That being said, this is not a section that's available in the current default theme, <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span>. However, I'm describing it here since you're likely to find it in many other themes. To demonstrate this, I'll switch to the previous default theme of WordPress, <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Seventeen</span>. This is what the <span class="packt_screen">Header Media</span> section looks like when using that theme. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c230f123-3dac-4c7e-864a-340c4ab289c8.png" style="width:37.00em;height:36.58em;" width="900" height="891"/></p>
<p>Most themes will allow you to select any image to be placed inside the header, and sometimes even a video, as <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Seventeen</span> does. <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Seventeen</span> also has some specific requirements for the header image (actually, most themes have, and <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Seventeen</span> is only an example of that). The suggested size is 2,000 pixels wide by 1,200 pixels tall, but you don't have to worry all that much about this because WordPress also provides some handy image editing tools. All you have to do here is use the <span class="packt_screen">Choose image</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Add new image</span> buttons and select one of the pictures from your <span class="packt_screen">Media Library</span>, or upload a new one. WordPress will immediately redirect you to the aforementioned image editing tools, where you can adjust and crop your image, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>After clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Crop Image</span> button and then <span class="packt_screen">Save &amp; Publish</span>, we're done with setting up the header image. Here's what the site might look like afterward:</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Background</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Some WordPress themes also allow you to adjust not only the header but the entire background of the site as well, meaning that you can place any image in the background of the whole site, and have it remain there at all times. This works similarly to a desktop wallpaper, but for your WordPress website. Although the current default theme, <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span>, doesn't offer this functionality, this is still a very common feature to find in other themes, so let's discuss it here using another former default theme, <span class="packt_screen">Twenty Fifteen</span>.</p>
<p>If you use that theme, and you go to the Customizer, you will see a new section in the sidebar called <span class="packt_screen">Background Image</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/530ff3b6-b5b2-4429-87e1-3e96c6252897.png" style="width:20.33em;height:25.92em;" width="365" height="465"/></p>
<p>The first thing we have to do is select an image we want to place in the background of our whole site. Let me say that again: our whole site. Right after selecting an image (just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Select Image</span> button that's visible in the preceding screenshot), the preview block will be refreshed, and you will be able to see what your background looks like at the moment. Immediately, there are some new options visible at the bottom of the options block:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9f4cb21d-5bd3-484c-ba29-cf569b3278e5.png" style="width:28.75em;height:43.25em;" width="458" height="691"/></p>
<p>The various options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Background Repeat</span>: This can be <span class="packt_screen">No Repeat</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Tile Horizontally</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Tile Vertically</span>:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">No Repeat</span>: This means that your background image will be displayed only once, and after the visitor scrolls down, they will simply <em>run out</em> of the background image.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tile</span>: This is the most popular setting and actually the default one as well. This means that WordPress will repeat your image in both dimensions (width and height). No matter what part of your site the visitor is browsing, the background image will always be visible.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tile Horizontally</span>: This tiles your image horizontally.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tile Vertically</span>: This tiles your image vertically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Background Position</span>: This can be <span class="packt_screen">Left</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Center</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Right</span>. This decides whether the background image should be aligned to the left, center, or right.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Background Attachment</span>: This can be either <span class="packt_screen">Scroll</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Fixed</span>:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Scroll</span>: Your image scrolls along with the content.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Fixed</span>: Your image remains in a fixed position. In other words, it stands still in the background at all times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I encourage you to play around with these settings for a while when adjusting your site.</p>

<p>Even though we did discuss widgets earlier in this chapter, the Customizer offers you an alternative way of working with them. You can do it in the section called <span class="packt_screen">Widgets</span>.</p>
<p>Once you click on it, you will see all the <em>widget areas</em> currently available in your theme. Then, when you click on any of those, you will see all the <em>individual widgets</em> that are assigned to that given area. All those widgets can be easily edited much like we did earlier in this chapter; the methodology is the same.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Homepage settings or Static Front Page</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This next section in the Customizer is commonly called either <span class="packt_screen">Homepage Settings</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Static Front Page</span>, based on the specific theme you're using. Once you navigate there, you will be able to change the main settings of the page that is displayed when a visitor comes to your home page<span>—t</span>he main address of your website. You can set a couple of things here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e971d957-2ee0-48a1-80ea-59d46037ef78.png" style="width:16.33em;height:21.42em;" width="311" height="410"/></p>
<p>Once you go there, you will be able to choose between the default setting of <span class="packt_screen">Your latest posts</span> (in this mode, the home page is just a classic listing of your latest blog posts; this is the default setting that you're probably used to) and a new setting labeled, <span class="packt_screen">A static page</span>. That second one gives you the possibility to set whatever page you wish as the home page of your website. You can either select an existing page from the dropdown list under <span class="packt_screen">Homepage</span> or create a new page by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> <span class="packt_screen">Add New Page</span> link.</p>
<p>As you might recall from <em><a href="74cf5381-e680-4dc0-8de9-7d95b3e08b69.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, Pages, Media, and Importing/Exporting Content</em>, what we did there was create a new page and set it as the custom home page for the site. We called the page <span class="packt_screen">Home<span>—</span></span>quite fittingly. It's important to remember that any page that you assign as your home page still remains an otherwise normal page, meaning that you can edit it like any other page via the <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> section of <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>.</p>
<p>Apart from the <span class="packt_screen">Homepage</span>, there's also another block here, labeled <span class="packt_screen">Posts page</span>. If you change your home page to a static one, it's always a good idea to assign a new <span class="packt_screen">Posts page</span> as well. Since the classic listing of your latest posts will no longer be displayed on the home page, the new <span class="packt_screen">Posts page</span> is meant to handle this task from now on. As with the home page, you can select an existing page to serve as the new posts page, or create a new one.</p>
<p>In this case, however, it's actually more convenient to create a completely new page rather than picking an existing one. You can call yours <span class="packt_screen">BLOG</span> or another similar name that conveys the page's purpose. What's interesting about this page is that you don't need to edit it manually or place any content on it. WordPress will populate this page with content on its own, so the only thing you need to do is just create it, and that's it.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If you do create a new <span class="packt_screen">posts page</span>, don't forget to link it from your main menu. Otherwise, your audience will have no way of finding it when they visit your website. We talked about menus earlier in this chapter.</div>

<p><span class="packt_screen">Additional CSS</span> is the final block of Customizer. This one can be handy if you want to include some custom changes in your current theme, changes that can't be achieved in any other way. Once you click on <span class="packt_screen">Additional CSS</span>, you will see a text input block where you will be able to incorporate any CSS code you wish. Be careful here, though. Working with raw CSS code can quickly cause problems if you're not sure what you're doing. Overall, this section is meant for advanced theme customizations:</p>

                            <header>

            <article>
                
<p>One more interesting thing that you can do in WordPress Customizer is schedule your changes to be made public on a given date, rather than being rolled out right away.</p>
<p>By default, when you click on the main <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button, whatever changes you made to your site will go public immediately. In order to schedule the changes instead, click on the <em>gear icon</em> right next to the main <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button of WordPress Customizer. Then, from the section that will appear, select <span class="packt_screen">Schedule</span> and then pick the exact date and time you want your changes to be made public. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ae8d1ce4-bc21-4405-94a5-50df5c80e25d.png" style="width:40.50em;height:36.25em;" width="823" height="738"/></p>
<p>Apart from that, one thing you might have noticed in the preceding screenshot is that there is also a <em>preview link</em> available. You can use it to share your changes with other people or to review them later on yourself.</p>
<p>This whole functionality can be advantageous in actual real-world scenarios when working on a live website. You simply don't always want your changes to go live the second you're done working on them. Preparing for a scheduled launch is often a more appealing perspective. Also, thanks to this feature, you can avoid rolling out changes at your website's peak traffic hours.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Last but not least, there are four interesting icons sitting in the bottom-left corner of the Customizer window, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f1b81291-0dd9-4a33-b17e-6d39e51d4aa1.png" style="width:20.92em;height:4.75em;" width="467" height="106"/></p>
<p>From the left, they are the <span class="packt_screen">Hide Controls</span> button (this hides the whole Customizer sidebar to give you a bigger canvas when adjusting your website), the <em>desktop view</em> icon, the <em>tablet view</em> icon, and the <em>mobile view</em> icon. Those final three icons are particularly important. These days, more people tend to browse the web on their mobile devices than on classic desktop computers. Because of that, it's crucially important for you to make sure that your website displays properly on those devices. These three icons<span>—</span>the desktop view icon, the tablet view icon, and the mobile view icon, allow you to do just that. When you click on any of them, the whole Customizer window will change in size to emulate the display mode on tablets and mobile devices. Switching back and forth between the modes, you can make sure that your site looks great on all devices. We will expand on the topic of mobile optimization in the very next part of this chapter.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p> <strong>Accelerated mobile pages</strong> (<span><strong>AMP</strong></span>) is an open source project introduced by Google in an effort to make the viewing of content on mobile more streamlined and user-friendly, no matter what device the user might be using.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, the idea of mobile web was only getting started, and a lot of websites were incredibly poorly optimized for mobile viewing. Back in the day, mobile wasn't so important, since the technology didn't allow for effective media consumption on a mobile phone. However, with the introduction of smartphones, this all changed. Nowadays, more people access the web on mobile than on desktops and laptops combined.</p>
<p>Clearly, websites needed to adapt and deliver an optimized interface for mobile viewing alongside their default, desktop-only view.</p>
<p>This is where AMP comes into play. In many cases, making an existing website mobile-friendly isn't the easiest of tasks. If your theme/design didn't come as mobile-optimized out of the box, retrofitting mobile on top of it can prove difficult. AMP provides an easier solution. Instead of forcing you to rebuild parts of your site manually, you can install an add-on AMP module, and have it done automatically. What you get as a result is an AMP version of your website. This new version will be displayed only to your mobile visitors. Here's what makes AMP a good idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's optimized for high performance—AMP pages load almost instantly, which is a preferable scenario for a mobile user than waiting a couple of seconds before starting to see anything appear on the page<span>—</span>a situation that's common for pages that are not optimized for mobile viewing</li>
<li>Google prefers AMP pages when displaying results for mobile searches</li>
<li>The design of AMP is simplified, putting content first and thus letting your visitor quickly get to the part that's of interest to them</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's add to that the fact that AMP is getting popular rather quickly. As data tells us (<a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/google-amp-one-year-later">https://theblog.adobe.com/google-amp-one-year-later</a>), in February 2017, AMP pages accounted for a whopping 7% of all web traffic for top publishers in the United States.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How to enable AMP in WordPress</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Unsurprisingly, there's a plugin that handles the integration for you. It's simply called <span class="packt_screen">AMP for WordPress</span>, and you can get it from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/dd6f96df-6470-42a0-8f8a-56638a593b72.png" style="width:38.25em;height:17.50em;" width="956" height="438"/></p>
<p>This plugin literally couldn't be easier to use. The only thing you need to do is install and activate it. After that, it picks up on its own and works on autopilot. There are only a few optional settings you can adjust. The first one can be found in <span class="packt_screen">AMP</span> | <span class="packt_screen">General</span>. By default, AMP for WordPress is enabled only for blog posts. You can change that by turning it on for your pages as well:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6610b413-05d0-494b-8aa8-d8a64a152e7d.png" style="width:28.50em;height:13.75em;" width="693" height="336"/></p>
<p>At this stage, your website is fully integrated with AMP. Whenever someone tries to access one of your posts or pages on mobile, they will be redirected to the AMP version of it. You can find those if you append <kbd>/amp/</kbd> to the end of your standard post URLs, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard version of a post</strong>: <kbd>yoursite.com/some-post/</kbd></li>
<li><strong>AMP version of a post</strong>: <kbd>yoursite.com/some-post/amp/</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>The second thing you can customize is the color scheme of the AMP theme. To do that, go to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">AMP</span>. You will be able to change the colors and the general vibe of the color scheme:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/66a190cb-bbfe-4684-a285-1eea6d6765cd.png" style="width:16.50em;height:16.92em;" width="355" height="365"/></p>
<p>Here's what an example post might look like when converted to AMP and viewed on mobile:</p>
