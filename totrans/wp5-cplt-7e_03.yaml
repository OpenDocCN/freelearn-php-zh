    of the popular hosting companies, rent some server space from them, and then have
    WordPress installed on that server. Even though this might sound intimidating

    a page or post for the future, show users accurate time stamps, or even just make
    sure that email notifications are correctly timestamped. Additionally, if you're
    planning to publish content internationally, meaning that your target audience

    represent your target audience and not yourself.

    the permanent URLs to your individual pages, blog posts, categories, and tags.
    By default, WordPress links to your new posts using a highly unoptimized URL structure.
    For instance, if you create a post titled *How to Cook the Best Meal Ever,* WordPress
    will link it as `http://yoursite.com/?p=123` (or something similar). The main
    problem with this structure is that it doesn''t indicate what the page is about.
    Neither your visitors nor Google will be able to make a guess. In the case of

    rankings. Therefore, to set a more optimized structure, you can go to Settings

    post will be `http://yoursite.com/how-to-cook-the-best-meal-ever/`, which is a

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One final point that's worth discussing in this chapter is the matter of WordPress
    avatars. Although WordPress provides a number of possibilities in this area, the
    most popular one revolves around an external service, **Globally Recognized Avatar** (**Gravatar**).
    Gravatar started as a tool meant to provide people with the capability of using
    the same profile picture (avatar) across the entire web.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What this means in plain English is that whenever you sign up for a web service,
    and if the service is Gravatar-compatible, so to speak, then it will fetch your
    profile picture from Gravatar automatically, instead of forcing you to upload
    it manually from your computer. Apart from the profile picture, Gravatar also
    gives you a personal online profile that anyone can see whenever they click on
    your (Gravatar) profile picture or something called Hovercard. Now, what does
    all this have to do with WordPress, right? Well, WordPress is one of those services
    and tools that widely support Gravatar in all possible areas of the platform.
    For example, if you create a new blog and use an admin email address that's hooked
    up to Gravatar, your profile picture in WordPress will immediately be replaced
    with the one provided by Gravatar. Moreover, if you ever comment on any WordPress
    blog with a Gravatar email address, your profile picture will be set as the avatar
    for the comment itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To set your own Gravatar, just go to [https://en.gravatar.com/](https://en.gravatar.com/) and
    click on the Create Your Own Gravatar button. You'll be presented with a sign-up
    form for Gravatar. Since Gravatar is part of WordPress.com, you are able to log
    in if you already have a WordPress.com account. If not, you can create a new one.
    The fields are quite standard, with you being prompted to enter your email address
    and your preferred username and password.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you've completed the sign-up process, you can finally set your Gravatar.
    On the main Manage Gravatars page (accessible via the top menu), there's a link
    labeled Add a new image—this is where you can upload a Gravatar. The good thing
    about Gravatar is that you can choose where you want to get the picture from.
    You can either upload it from your computer, get it from some other place on the
    web (for example, from a direct link to your Facebook profile image), or use a
    picture that you've uploaded as your Gravatar previously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the next step, Gravatar allows you to crop and adjust your image. When you're
    finally happy with the result, you can click the big button and proceed to the
    rating settings of your image. Every Gravatar can be classified as **G-rated**, **PG-rated**, **R-rated**,
    or **X-rated**. The fact is that if you select anything other than **G-rated**,
    your Gravatar won't be displayed on all sites. Thus, it's a good practice to upload
    only appropriate images. When you're done with this step, from now on, your Gravatar
    is set up and ready to use. Gravatar also enables you to hook up more than one
    email address to a single account, as well as use more than one image. This is
    actually a great feature because you can manage each of your email addresses and
    every form of your online presence with just one Gravatar account.
