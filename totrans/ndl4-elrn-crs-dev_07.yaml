- en: Resources are the instructional materials that students use to achieve the learning
    and performative outcomes of a course. In a world where face-to-face instruction
    is often severely curtailed, and synchronous web conferencing and asynchronous
    deliveries are often blended, readings, videos, maps, podcasts, and other kinds
    of documents are the key building blocks that are used in each course. Moodle
    gives you a way to organize the materials so that they flow in accordance with
    your course plan, and you can make the resources available in a way that makes
    sense, given your learning goals. The flexibility that Moodle offers has become
    increasingly important in today's environment of blended synchronous and asynchronous
    learning. This chapter will teach you how to add those resources to a course,
    as well as how to make the best use of them. We will also discuss how to select,
    sequence, and deploy the resources so that they contribute to student success
    in achieving outcomes.

    and **Course Design Document** (**CDD**), which we discussed in [*Chapter 3*](B17288_03_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259),
    *Creating Categories and Courses*. As you may recall, the course map and CDD constitute
    a storyboard and learning outcomes. In Moodle, "resources" refer to the content
    that you'll include in the course. The interactive assessments and engagers are
    referred to as "activities," but we'll cover that in [*Chapter 6*](B17288_06_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor467),
    *Adding Assignments, Lessons, Feedback, and Choice*. For now, let's consider the
    best way to develop the course materials that will best align with the course
    goals.
  prefs: []

- en: It is great to have lots of resources, especially those that align with all
    kinds of learners in the course. However, unless they are organized well, and
    they tie clearly to course outcomes, you'll generate frustration instead of confidence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Planning and organization are the keys to success in selecting, sequencing,
    and deploying your resources. Always tie them first to the learning outcomes,
    and then ensure that they are grouped in ascending order of complexity so that
    you're building a strong foundation and then scaffolding it at higher levels.

    asynchronous, blended pedagogy, and so on) so that you can optimize the way that
    they are deployed. For example, a 90-minute video might be appropriate for asynchronous
    or *on-demand* courses, but not for a synchronous course, where *live* interaction
    is where most of the learning takes place.

    includes a lot of non-standard HTML code. The same thing occurs with other word
    processing programs, such as Google Docs. This code doesn't work well in all browsers
    and it makes it more difficult to edit the HTML code on your page. Many advanced
    web page editors can clean up Word HTML code. Keep in mind that the editor cleans
    up any code that could be dangerous and create vulnerabilities that could be exploited
    by hackers. So, don't be surprised if your text looks different than you had expected.

    macros. First, the spacing is rarely exactly right, and to correct it takes quite
    a bit of time. However, it may not be possible to be online all that time, so
    you may wish to work offline and not in Moodle. So, you may want to compose your
    web page in an HTML editor such as **Adobe** **Dreamweaver** or even the free
    web-based HTML editor **SeaMonkey**. This is especially true if you want to take
    advantage of these editors'' ability to insert advanced features into your web
    page. How, then, do you get that page into your Moodle course? You can copy and

    attempt to open that file. Moodle will only pass the file to the student's computer.
    For example, if it's a PDF file, your student's computer will probably try to
    use Adobe Reader or the Preview app to open the file. If it's a word processing
    file, your student's computer will attempt to use Word or some other word processor
    to open it. If your student's computer doesn't have a program that can open that
    type of file, it will probably prompt the student to save the file. In the case
    of a graphic or a sound file, their computer will use whatever resident application's
    most convenient. It is usually not the ideal one.

  prefs:

- en: 'In the last few years, the number of educational videos has proliferated, and
    they are often of very high quality. For example, the **United States Department
    of Agriculture** (**USDA**) has made a number of their food inspection training
    videos available on their website: [https://www.fsis.usda.gov/inspection/inspection-training-videos/regulatory-education-video-seminars](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/inspection/inspection-training-videos/regulatory-education-video-seminars).
    If you are a school that offers vocational training, you''re probably thrilled
    that such high-quality resources exist and that they are free to use for educational
    purposes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may be tempting to simply upload the videos into separate modules. You say
    to yourself, "Yippee! Instant course!" and you tell yourself it's all good. After
    all, the videos contain instructions. But is such an approach legitimate? Is it
    a full course? The short answer is "no." Even if the video has learning objectives
    within it, you still need to frame the instructional video within an instructional
    strategy.

    align with your goals, you'll still need to create a course map and a CDD that
    include the elements we discussed earlier in this chapter.

    are non-interactive course materials (books, pages, URLs, files, and labels) that
    form the core of most online courses.
  prefs: []

- en: Adding static material first gives you a chance to think about how the material
    will be discussed and used. Later, you can add more dynamic resources, and make
    connections to the course objectives and the assessments. The intent of Moodle
    4.0 is to enhance your learning experience, as well as giving you more opportunities
    to deploy resources in ways that trigger thoughts and connections to the learning
    objectives and course goals, and help you demonstrate mastery.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we emphasized in this chapter was the importance of selecting, sequencing,
    and deploying resources so that they always advance the goals of the course and
    help students meet their learning objectives. We also discussed how to incorporate
    current practices that include blended asynchronous/synchronous delivery, particularly
    when there is a desire to include webinars, which are then recorded (with transcripts).

    they correspond to can help instill a sense of confidence and an "I can do it!"
    attitude in them. We also provided functionality tips for strategies to boost
    student engagement for blended synchronous and asynchronous courses.

    of just reading and viewing material that you post, the student will produce work
    and interact with their teacher and peers online.
