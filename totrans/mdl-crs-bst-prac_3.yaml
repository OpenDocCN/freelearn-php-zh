    course. In this chapter, we'll learn how to build a structure that accommodates
    your course content, activities, resources, information, and assessments. In [Chapter
    2](26182cb1-48bc-4e6d-846a-4a11089be075.xhtml), *Planning Your Course*, you learned
    how to plan your course with learning outcomes in mind. Now, as we start adding
    content, thinking about how students will demonstrate their knowledge, skills,
    and attitudes will help us effectively organize the course. We'll start by building
    a framework.

    used elements in Moodle courses. Keep in mind, however, that we're not including
    everything. Instead, we're aiming to build a basic framework in a step-by-step
    manner so that, by the end of this chapter, you will be in a position to add the
    content and activities in your course in a clear, coherent way, all the while
    keeping the overall learning outcomes in mind.

    reflecting upon what you want your students to be able to do by the end of the
    course and the course material that you'll need to include for them to demonstrate
    that they've achieved their learning outcomes. Keep in mind that it's best to
    keep your list simple and focused on the essential items rather than on all the
    potential supplemental or optional material, that might enrich your list but isn't
    vital.

    which to create functionally consistent courses for use in college degree programs,
    certificate courses, corporate training, and so on, and what we are doing in this
    chapter represents a very important step towards achieving it. So, if we keep
    the big picture in mind and consider the needs and ultimate objectives of the
    stakeholders, from learning organization administrators to curriculum developers,
    instructional designers, professors/teachers, and students, we will be in a better
    position to make good decisions as we select the settings and options in Moodle.
    This will help us make sure that our course is well designed and functional, resulting
    in a positive learning experience.

    it is a good idea to make sure that the roles have consistent names and that you
    do not rename roles in every course. Maintaining consistency will help you avoid

    of the ways to change the look and feel of your course is using themes. Moodle
    has a wide array of built-in themes that can be utilized to give your course a
    customized look and feel. It is often worthwhile to use a theme developed by a
    Moodle developer. Many are free and others can be licensed. Themes can be particularly
    useful if you are using multiple devices and you want your course to automatically
    display content well for tablets, laptops, smartphones, desktops, and other handheld
    devices.

    and works equally well with laptops, tablets, and smartphones, you may wish to
    select the Boost theme. It is flexible for individuals with impaired vision, and
    the font sizes and column heights can be adjusted by the users.

    customize it to get a recognizable, unique brand, you may wish to select the fluid-width,
    three-column **Clean** theme. Clean (or MoodleCloud) is a responsive, bootstrap-based
    theme. It is one of three standard Moodle themes.
  prefs: []

    the theme. Unfortunately, it is not standard in MoodleCloud, but it is available

    settings and elements to create a framework that can be consistent and flexible
    for all your courses. For example, you can develop a demo course and use it as
    a template or guide for future courses. We discussed the reasons for making certain
    decisions as we develop the framework and how to think about the best ways to
    make your course accessible for all your students.
