<p>From its very first versions, WordPress has always been designed as a very open platform. This openness has been exemplified not only through its open source licensing and distribution model, but also its open plugin architecture, providing developers with the ability to deliver an even richer experience to its users.</p>
<p>While a basic WordPress installation provides a great amount of functionality that continues to expand from one release to the next, users often have the need to add one more feature to make it the perfect website management system. This is where the plugins come into play. They can fill this gap by augmenting or manipulating virtually any aspect of a WordPress website's display and administrative tasks.</p>
<p>Just like WordPress, plugins are written in the PHP programming language, which is structurally similar to more traditional languages such as C and C++. This code is stored in plain ASCII text files that are read and executed on the web server when pages are requested to be displayed. The secret ingredient that enables plugins to have such great power in WordPress is the inclusion of callback mechanisms, called <strong>hooks</strong>, throughout the platform's source code. These hooks come in two flavors, called action and filter hooks, which allow plugins to add content to a site and modify data before it is displayed, respectively. Whether it's rendering a site's front page, a single article, or its administration pages, WordPress has hundreds of entry points where custom functions can be executed.</p>
<p>Beyond their ability to augment WordPress functionality, a side benefit of plugins is that most functionalities they add to a site are independent of the active theme. Therefore, users who like to change their theme frequently don't have to worry about manually adding back custom elements to their new themes when they make a switch.</p>
<p>This chapter explains the difference between action and filter hooks and shows how to use them to write a first set of plugins that will range in functionality from adding information to the page header to defining new custom shortcodes.</p>

<p>The first step of creating a WordPress plugin is to create a PHP file inside of the plugins directory and add the necessary information to have it recognized by the system. This first recipe shows you how to create a basic plugin file for WordPress and how to see and activate this new extension from the administration interface.</p>

<p>Plugin files can either be located directly in the <kbd>wp-content/plugins</kbd> directory or in a subdirectory under this location. When you access the installed plugins list in the administration interface, WordPress scans all potential plugin locations, looking for PHP files that contain comments following the format specified in this recipe. There can actually be one or more PHP files containing plugin header data in any of these directories, and each of them will show up as an entry in the plugin list.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the code that we entered in the file, the first line of the plugin file is a tag that identifies the beginning of the PHP code that will be analyzed and executed by the PHP interpreter. Optionally, we could include a closing PHP tag (?&gt;) at the end of the file. However, most PHP developers omit the closing tag, since having any spaces after that tag will cause warnings to be displayed by the interpreter.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">To ensure compatibility with most WordPress installations, it is important to use the complete <kbd>&lt;?php</kbd> open tag syntax in your plugin code instead of the <kbd>&lt;?</kbd> short-hand version, since not all PHP installations are configured to support the short version and many users don't have access to change this type of configuration on their server.</div>
<p>The second and last lines indicate that the enclosed text should be considered as text comments. Finally, each line within the comment contains a specific label, indicating the type of information that follows it. When this information is found, WordPress retrieves data about the plugin and adds it to the list.</p>
<p>When a plugin is activated, WordPress validates the file's content to be sure that it is valid PHP code. It will then execute this content every time any page is rendered on the site, whether that page is front-facing or a backend administration section. For this reason, it is preferable to activate plugins only when they are in use, to avoid site slowdowns.</p>
<p>Of course, at this point, our new plugin does not add or modify any functionality in our WordPress installation, since it does not contain real code, but this is still an important first step.</p>

<p>A common action performed by plugins is to add extra content to the header of visitor-facing pages generated by WordPress. This recipe shows you how to register an action hook function to be able to add such additional content. To make this example more concrete, we will use the Google Analytics page header JavaScript code that so many people use to get good page view statistics for their site.</p>

<p>The <kbd>add_action</kbd> function is used to associate custom plugin code to one of the two types of WordPress hooks, the action hook. As mentioned briefly in this chapter's introduction, hooks are the enabling functionality that make plugins possible in WordPress. Action hooks enable the execution of additional code at specific points when either public-facing or administration pages are prepared to be displayed. This code usually adds content to a site or changes the way a given action is performed.</p>
<p>In this recipe, the first line of code that we wrote registered a function named <kbd>ch2pho_page_header_output</kbd> with an action hook called <kbd>wp_head</kbd>. This action is one among more than 2,400 action hooks that are available in current versions of WordPress and it allows any registered function to output additional content to the page header. Since all echoed content will be displayed, we can write our callback function very simply by placing <kbd>?&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;?php</kbd> tags around the Google Analytics code. This will tell PHP to display all the content that is within that function's body, as opposed to interpreting it.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, the current code is not very flexible, since you would need to hardcode your Google Analytics account number in the output for it to function properly. The creation of a configuration panel in <a href="0346c3c6-27ee-45fb-bfd6-df398e04b2b4.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 3</span></a>, <em>User Settings and Administration Pages</em>, will provide a way to configure such information to make our plugins more flexible.</p>
<p>Now, to fully understand its syntax, let's take a closer look at the complete <kbd>add_action</kbd> function:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">add_action ( 'hook_name', 'your_function_name', [priority],<br/>             [accepted_args] );</pre>
<p>The first parameter, the hook name, indicates the name of the WordPress hook that we want our custom function to be associated with. This name must be accurately spelled; otherwise, our function will not be called and no error message will be displayed.</p>
<p>The second parameter is the name of the plugin function that will be called to perform an action. This function can have any name, with the only condition being that this name must be unique enough to avoid conflicts with function names from other plugins or from the core WordPress code. In this recipe, the function name starts with an acronym representing the name of the plugin, making it much more unique.</p>
<p>The priority parameter is optional, as indicated by the square brackets, and has a default value of 10. It indicates the execution priority of this plugin relative to other plugin functions that hook into the same action, with a lower number indicating a higher priority.</p>
<p>Any plugin can register one or more functions with an action hook using the <kbd>add_action</kbd> function. As it is rendering web pages, WordPress keeps a queue of all entries and calls them at the appropriate moment. It is interesting to note that the hook mechanism is also used by WordPress itself, as it regularly calls the <kbd>add_action</kbd> function in its own code to register functions to be called at the right time. If you realize that you need your function to be called before or after other plugins that are registering with the same hook, change the value of the priority parameter.</p>
<p>The last parameter of the <kbd>add_action</kbd> function, <kbd>accepted_args</kbd>, has a default value of <kbd>1</kbd> and should be assigned a number. It should also only be set to a different value for some particular hooks where more than one parameter should be passed to the registered function. Some of these hooks will be covered in later recipes.</p>

<p>Finding the right hooks to register plugin functions is a large part of WordPress plugin development. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to get information on existing hooks and learn when they get called during the WordPress page generation process.</p>

<p>The WordPress Codex (<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/">https://codex.wordpress.org/</a>) and WordPress Code Reference (<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/">https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/</a>) are documentation sites that contain a multitude of information that is useful to users and developers alike. When it comes to action hooks, the Codex contains information on the most commonly used hooks, with basic descriptions indicating how they can be used, and can be found here: <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference"><span class="URLPACKT">https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference</span></a>. That being said, this is not a complete listing.</p>
<p>There are many third-party sites that parse the WordPress source code and provide their own hook listings (for example, <a href="http://hookr.io"><span class="URLPACKT">http://hookr.io</span></a>). While hooks are not as eloquently documented in these types of raw listings, they do provide basic information on their names and where they are called as WordPress generates pages for visitors and administrators. These details can be enough to find a hook based on the functionality that you are trying to implement.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Since WordPress is open source, another way to find information about hooks is to search directly within its code. For every action hook that accepts user functions, you will see a call to the <kbd>do_action</kbd> function to execute all the registered items. As can be seen, the function takes two or more arguments, with the second one(s) being optional:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">do_action ( 'tag', [$arg] ); </pre>
<p>For the example shown in this recipe, a search for <kbd>do_action( 'wp_head' )</kbd> reveals that it is the only function that is called when a theme makes a call to the <kbd>wp_head()</kbd> function in its header file:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">do_action( 'wp_head' ); </pre>

            <article>
                
<p>On occasion, plugins need to refer to external files (for example, images, JavaScript, or jQuery script files) that are stored in the plugin directory. Since users are free to rename a plugin's folder or even install plugin files straight into the WordPress plugin directory, paths to any external files must be built dynamically based on the actual plugin location. Thankfully, a number of utility functions are present to simplify this task. In this recipe, we will write a simple plugin that will add a favicon meta tag to a website's header, pointing to an image file located in the plugin directory.</p>

<p>The <kbd>plugins_url</kbd> utility function, used in conjunction with the <kbd>__FILE__</kbd> PHP constant and the name of our favicon file, enables us to quickly get the URL of the directory where our plugin files are located and print out the appropriate HTML command to notify browsers of the location of this file:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">plugins_url( $path, $plugin ); </pre>
<p>The <kbd>plugins_url</kbd> function can be called with or without parameters. In the first case, it builds a URL by appending the path found in the first parameter to the location of the file specified in the second argument. In the second situation, it simply returns the location of the plugin directory.<br/>
<br/>
Before we display our plugin's favicon file, we also check to see whether the user has already assigned a site icon using the WordPress customizer. If that is the case, we give priority to that icon and display it using the built-in <kbd>wp_site_icon</kbd> function.</p>

<p>Beyond adding functionality or content to a site, the other major task commonly performed by plugins is to augment, modify, or reduce information before it is displayed on the screen. This is done by using WordPress filter hooks, which allow plugins to register a custom function through the WordPress API to be called, since content is prepared before it is sent to the browser. In this recipe, you will learn how to implement your first filter callback function to modify the contents of the generator meta tag that is output as part of the site header.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>

<p>The <kbd>add_filter</kbd> function is used to associate a custom plugin function to the second type of WordPress hooks, the filter hook. Filter hooks give plugins the chance to augment, modify, delete, or completely replace information while WordPress is executed. To enable this, filter functions are sent data that can be modified as a function parameter. They must return the resulting set of data back to WordPress once they have finished making the changes.</p>
<p>Unlike action hooks, filter functions must not output any text or HTML code, since they are executed while output is being prepared and that would likely result in the output showing up in unexpected places in the site layout. Instead, they should return the filtered data.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the parameters of the <kbd>add_filter</kbd> function, we can see that it is very similar to the <kbd>add_action</kbd> function that we saw in the previous recipes:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">add_filter( 'hook_name', 'your_function_name', [priority],<br/>            [accepted_args] ); </pre>
<p>The first parameter, the hook name, indicates the name of the WordPress hook that we want our custom function to be associated with. This name must be accurately spelled; otherwise, our function will not be called and no error message will be displayed.</p>
<p>The second parameter is the name of the plugin function that will be called to filter data. This function can have any name, with the only condition being that this name must be unique enough to avoid conflicting with functions from other plugins or from the WordPress code.</p>
<p>The <kbd>priority</kbd> parameter is optional, as indicated by the square brackets, and has a default value of <kbd>10</kbd>. It indicates the execution priority of this plugin relative to other plugins that are loaded by WordPress, with a lower number indicating a higher priority.</p>
<p>The last parameter of the function, <kbd>accepted_args</kbd>, has a default value of <kbd>1</kbd> and indicates how many parameters will be sent to your custom filter function. It should only be set to higher values when you are using filters that will send multiple parameters, as shown in this recipe with the <kbd>$html</kbd> and <kbd>$type</kbd> arguments.</p>

<p>The <kbd>preg_replace</kbd> function is a PHP function that can be used to perform a search and replace operation within a string based on a search pattern. We use this function rather than the simpler <kbd>str_replace</kbd><span>,</span> since we want to find and replace both the WordPress keyword and its associated version number, which changes with every version.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Similar to action hooks, information about commonly used filter hooks can be found on the WordPress Codex (<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference"><span class="URLPACKT">https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference</span></a>) or on sites that provide raw function lists (for example, <a href="http://hookr.io"><span class="URLPACKT">http://hookr.io</span></a>).</p>
<p>It is also possible to learn about filter hooks by searching for occurrences of the <kbd>apply_filters</kbd> function in the WordPress code. As can be seen in the following code, this function has a variable number of arguments, with the first one being the name of the filter hook, the second representing the value that the registered function will be able to modify, and the remaining optional parameters containing additional data that may be useful in the implementation of the filter function:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">apply_filters( $tag, $value, $var ... );  </pre>
<p>For the example shown in this recipe, a search for <kbd>apply_filters( 'the_generator'</kbd> in the WordPress code reveals that it is called within the <kbd>the_generator</kbd> template function:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">echo apply_filters( 'the_generator', <br/>                    get_the_generator( $type ), $type ); </pre>

<p>After making a number of changes to the page header, the generator meta tag, and the site favicon, this recipe takes a more active role by adding a link to each post or page, allowing visitors to email a link to the item that they are currently viewing. This functionality is implemented using a filter hook attached to the page and post content, allowing our custom function to append custom output code to all entries that get displayed on the screen.</p>

<p>Similar to the previous recipe, this plugin uses the <kbd>add_filter</kbd> function to register a custom function to be called by WordPress as it prepares an item's content to be displayed on the screen. When the filter function is called, the first action that it performs is to create a URL to the email icon that was downloaded in the recipe. It then goes on to modify the original content by appending the HTML code to display a <kbd>mailto</kbd> link. The same technique could be used to create links to popular social media and link sharing sites, with simple changes to the syntax of the link. Once the new content is ready, it is returned back to WordPress to be sent to any other registered filters and subsequently be displayed on the site.</p>

<p>The content filter function that is put in place by calling <kbd>add_filter</kbd> receives the entire content of all the posts and pages before they are rendered to the browser and is allowed to make any number of changes to this information. In this case, we are using the PHP <kbd>str_replace</kbd> function to search for any occurrence of the string <kbd>href</kbd>, which indicates a link. When the string is found, it is replaced with a call to a JavaScript function as well as the original <kbd>href</kbd> tag.</p>
<p>To make this plugin complete, it also needs to provide an implementation for the JavaScript <kbd>recordOutboundLink</kbd> function. This is done by registering a custom function with the <kbd>wp_footer</kbd> hook that will output extra content with the function code in the website's footer.</p>
<p>The resulting plugin automates many of the tasks related to tracking usage data on a website using Google Analytics.</p>

<p>As you transcribe code segments from the pages of this book or start writing your own plugins, there is a strong chance that you will have to troubleshoot problems with your code or have trouble working with data that your plugin is meant to manipulate. This recipe shows the basic techniques to identify and quickly resolve these errors while creating a plugin that will hide an item from the navigation menu for users who are not logged in to your site.</p>

<p>As WordPress assembles a list of all available plugins to display them in the administration interface, it does not check to see if each plugin's PHP code is valid. This check is actually done when a plugin is activated. At that time, any syntax error will be caught immediately and the newly-activated plugin will remain inactive, preventing a failure of the entire website.</p>
<p>That being said, once a plugin is activated, its code is evaluated every time WordPress renders a web page, and any subsequent code error that gets saved to the plugin file will cause the site to stop working correctly. For this reason, it is highly recommended to set up a local development environment, as shown in <a href=""><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 1</span></a>, <em>Preparing a Local Development Environment</em>, to avoid affecting a live site when an inevitable error creeps up in your plugin code. On a live website, to avoid potential outages, a safer method is to deactivate plugins before making changes to them, then reactivating them once changes have been made so that they are revalidated before their functionality is enabled. It should be noted that, with this method, the plugin's functionality won't be available on your site while you make changes, so it is not an optimal way to modify deployed code.</p>
<p>Once the code is working correctly, the second part of this recipe shows us how to visualize the information that is received by a custom filter function. While the WordPress Codex website provides great documentation about the purpose of most filters available, it does not go into details about the structure of the information that is sent to each filter function. Thankfully, the PHP <kbd>print_r</kbd> function comes in very handy, since it can display the content of any variable on the screen, no matter what information is stored in the variable it receives as an argument.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the implementation of the custom filter function uses the WordPress API function <kbd>is_user_logged_in()</kbd> to see whether the person viewing the site has provided login credentials, and then goes on to parse all the menu items and remove the <span class="packt_screen">Private</span> <span class="packt_screen">Area</span> menu item if the visitor is not logged in.</p>

<p>While the <kbd>wp-config.php</kbd> file, located at the top of the WordPress file structure, is primarily used to store basic site configuration data, it can also be used to trigger a number of debugging features. The first of these is the debug mode, which will display all PHP errors, warnings, and notices at the top of site pages. For example, having this option active will show all the undefined variables that you try to access in your code along with any deprecated WordPress function. To activate this tool, change the second parameter of the line defining the <kbd>WP_DEBUG</kbd> constant from <kbd>false</kbd> to <kbd>true</kbd> in <kbd>wp_config.php</kbd>:</p>
<pre>define( 'WP_DEBUG', true ); </pre>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To prevent debug messages from affecting the site's layout, you can download a useful plugin called Debug Bar (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/</span></a>) to collect messages and display them in the admin bar:</p>

<p>Other debugging features that can be activated from the <kbd>wp-config.php</kbd> file are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>WP_DEBUG_LOG</kbd>: Stores all debug messages in a file named <kbd>debug.log</kbd> in the site's <kbd>wp-content</kbd> directory for later analysis</li>
<li><kbd>WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY</kbd>: Indicates whether or not error messages should be displayed on the screen</li>
<li><kbd>SAVEQUERIES</kbd>: Stores database queries in a variable that can be displayed in the page footer (see <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Save_queries_for_analysis"><span class="URLPACKT">https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Save_queries_for_analysis</span></a> for more information)</li>

<p>Shortcodes are a very popular tool in WordPress that allow users to easily add content generated by plugins or themes to any page or post without needing to be familiar with PHP code and editing theme template files. As they are very simple to create, shortcodes can also be used to easily automate the output of content that repeatedly needs to be included in your site's content.</p>
<p>This recipe explains how to create a new custom shortcode that will be used to quickly add a link to a Twitter page in any post or page, automating a repetitive task.</p>

<p>Shortcodes have similarities with both action hooks and filter hooks, since their associated custom function is called when it is time to perform a task, just like an action hook, but they must return their output through a return value, just like a filter hook. In terms of external data, the function associated with a shortcode will receive data in the case of some types of codes, while it will only produce output in other cases.</p>
<p>When used in the text of a post or page, any shortcode surrounded by a pair of square brackets is identified by the WordPress engine, which then searches for functions registered for that specific code. If found, the associated function is called and the expected result is used to replace the original shortcode text in the item's content. Just like filter functions, shortcode functions must not output any text directly, since it would likely appear in an unexpected place in the page layout, as WordPress calls all shortcode-processing functions before displaying the body of an item.</p>
<p>For simple shortcodes, such as those in this recipe, the plugin functions associated with them must return information, but they do not receive any additional data through function parameters. That being said, they can rely on utility functions, such as <kbd>get_the_ID</kbd>, <kbd>get_the_title</kbd>, and other WordPress utility functions, to be able to produce the appropriate output. Other types of shortcodes seen in later recipes will have more context and configuration options. It is also possible for shortcodes to access stored options data, which will be covered in <a href="0346c3c6-27ee-45fb-bfd6-df398e04b2b4.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 3</span></a>, <em>User Settings and Administration Pages</em>.</p>

<p>While simple shortcodes already provide a lot of potential to output complex content to a page by entering a few characters in the post editor, shortcodes become even more useful when they are coupled with parameters that will be passed to their associated processing function. Using this technique, it becomes very easy to create a shortcode that accelerates the insertion of external content in WordPress posts or pages by only needing to specify the shortcode and the unique identifier of the source element to be displayed.</p>
<p>We will illustrate this concept in this recipe by creating a shortcode that will be used to quickly add Twitter feeds to posts or pages.</p>

<p>When shortcodes are used with parameters, these extra pieces of data are sent to the associated processing function in the <kbd>$atts</kbd> parameter variable. By using a combination of the standard PHP <kbd>extract</kbd> and WordPress-specific <kbd>shortcode_atts</kbd> functions, our plugin is able to parse the data sent to the shortcode and create an array of identifiers and values that are subsequently transformed into PHP variables that we can use in the rest of our shortcode implementation function. In this specific example, we expect a single variable to be used, called <kbd>user_name</kbd>, which will be stored in a PHP variable called <kbd>$user_name</kbd>. If the user enters the shortcode without any parameter, a default value of <kbd>ylefebvre</kbd> will be assigned to the username variable to ensure that the plugin still works. Since we are going to accept user input in this code, we also verify that the user did not provide an empty string and we use the <kbd>esc_html</kbd> and <kbd>esc_url</kbd> functions to remove any potentially harmful HTML characters from the input string and make sure that the link destination URL is valid.</p>
<p>Once we have access to the Twitter username, we can put together the required HTML code that will embed a Twitter feed in our page and display the selected user's tweets.</p>
<p>While this example only has one argument, it is possible to define multiple parameters for a shortcode.</p>

<p>A different type of shortcode is available in WordPress that encloses content in posts and pages. Using a syntax similar to HTML tags, enclosing shortcodes can be used to identify parts of an item's content that need to be treated in a special way. For example, it is possible to use this type of shortcode to style a part of the post.</p>
<p>As an example of how to create enclosing shortcodes, this recipe shows you how to create a set of tags that will identify part of a post or page that should only be shown to visitors that are logged in to a site. In this way, the shortcode acts similarly to a filter hook, with the added bonus that you do not need to parse for instances of these tags, as would normally be done in a filter.</p>

<p>Similar to a filter function, enclosing shortcodes receive a copy of the text that has been wrapped with the new tags. It is then possible to return this text with additional HTML code, or completely replace it with new content. In this specific case, we used the <kbd>is_user_logged_in</kbd> WordPress function to determine whether the current visitor is logged in to the site. Based on the result of that query, the code determines whether the original content should be displayed with some additional styling code, or if the visitor should see a message encouraging them to join the website.</p>

<p>When a plugin adds custom content or inserts styling tags to a post or page's existing content, as was done in the previous recipe showing how to create an enclosing shortcode, it usually needs to load a custom style sheet to style these new elements. This recipe shows how to add a style sheet in the WordPress style queue to format the private output created in the previous recipe. This queue is processed when the page header is rendered, listing all the style sheets that need to be loaded to display the site correctly.</p>

<p>While it would have been possible to write straight HTML code to load the CSS file by registering a function with the <kbd>wp_head</kbd> action hook, as we have done previously, WordPress has utility functions designed to help avoid loading duplicate style sheets or scripts on a site. In this specific example, <kbd>wp_enqueue_script</kbd> is used to place the plugin's style sheet file in a queue that will be processed when the plugin header is rendered, with the associated name <kbd>privateshortcodestyle</kbd>. Once WordPress has processed all the plugins and boiled down all the style sheet requests to single instances, it will output the necessary HTML code to load all of them.</p>
<p>The content of the <kbd>stylesheet.css</kbd> file is normal CSS code that specifies that any text that is assigned the <kbd>private</kbd> class should be displayed in gray, while the text displayed to non-registered users should be displayed in white on a red background.</p>

<p>So far, all plugin examples that have been covered in this chapter have been written using the procedural PHP programming style, with all the functions declared directly in the main body of the plugin and the hook registration functions having direct access to these functions.</p>
<p>WordPress can also be written using an object-oriented PHP approach. This recipe explains how to convert the code from the previous recipe into a class-based version of the same functionality.</p>

<p>The code changes that we applied to the plugin first declare a class for all of our plugin's functionality and also contain a constructor method for that class. The constructor method is called once, as soon as the class is instantiated by the last line in the plugin's code, and can be used to associate custom functions with all action hooks, filter hooks, and shortcodes.</p>
<p>The main benefit of using an object-oriented approach is that you don't have to be as careful when naming your hook callbacks and all other functions, since these names are local to the class and can be the same as function names declared in any other classes or in procedural PHP code.</p>
