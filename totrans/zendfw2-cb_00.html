Although the first framework was a real bulky framework with not much documentation, I feel that the second version of the framework improved greatly. The incredible toolshed full of features, makes this framework (personally) one of the best frameworks to work in.</p><p>But as we all probably know, because of its incredibly vast library of features the learning curve can appear very steep. That is why I felt the need to write about all the important parts of the framework, in bite-size pieces that don't overwhelm someone (you in this case) who wants to learn it.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To follow the book in the best possible way I would recommend using a Linux-based web server, as most of the recipes are more Linux oriented than Windows. If you are a Windows user you'll probably be better off installing a virtual machine with Linux on it, or installing a Zend Server community edition to make sure your machine is compatible for Zend Framework 2 development (you can also do this without Zend Server, but it is just more convenient).</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Zend Framework 2 Cookbook</em></span> is for PHP developers who are fairly advanced in PHP programming. It will also be useful for developers who have a keen interest in expanding their knowledge outside the boundaries of simply scripting pages together. As unit testing and MVC will be discussed, it is beneficial for the reader to know what these technologies are, although experience with developing applications is not necessarily essential.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can either get the flags from a message by using the <code class="literal">getFlags()</code> method, or by using the <code class="literal">hasFlag()</code> method."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?php
echo $this-&gt;dateFormat(
    // Format the current UNIX timestamp.
    time(),

    // Our date is to be a LONG date format.
    IntlDateFormatter::LONG,

    // We want to omit the time, defining this is 
    // optional as the default is NONE.
    IntlDateFormatter::NONE

);</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">SampleModule/
  config/
    module.config.php
<span class="strong"><strong>  language/</strong></span>
  src/
    SampleModule/
      Controller/
        IndexController.php
  view/
    samplemodule/
      index/
        index.phtml
  Module.php</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>php composer.phar update</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "After we have done all that we can, click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> and you can choose a location to save our file."</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
