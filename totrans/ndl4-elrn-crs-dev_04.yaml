    will see how to create the course, choose the best format for your course considering

- en: Moodle 4.0 offers major **user experience** (**UX**) improvements, and they
    are evident from the moment you start creating courses. First, there are navigation
    improvements that allow you to see your courses at a glance, navigate back to
    the last place you visited, and see all your courses at a glance in an improved
    Dashboard that merges calendars and timelines from all courses. You will also
    learn how to create course categories and use those categories to organize your
    course catalog. In keeping with current methods of instruction, which often involve
    Zoom, Teams, BigBlueButton, and other web conferencing software, you can also
    make it clear which courses are fully online or which have a blended delivery,
    with both synchronous and asynchronous elements. They should align with your institution's
    mission and vision so that you maintain a coherent presence. You will also be
    able to use the results for marketing and promoting your programs and your institution.

- en: Many learning organizations offer similar courses, yet their students feed back
    remarkably different experiences and outcomes. How can that be, if the content
    is identical? The reality is that your course content is just a part of the learning
    equation because it's all about the learning, not the teaching. A large component
    has to do with how the content is framed, contextualized, and then applied. Each
    ties into the primary mission and vision of your organization.
  prefs: []

    to make an impact, it must devise its primary mission – that is, the *how we will
    do it* component to the overarching *what our ideal world looks like* question.
    If you think this sounds a bit utopian, you are right. It is. The best learning
    organizations want to create a better world, even if that utopia will never actually
    exist in the real world, and to get there, they need to determine action steps,
    which translate to a mission implemented by strategy and tactics that can be implemented
    as follows:'

    target? Who are your learners? Where are they? What are their main strengths,

    well as your instructors if you want to have an effective learning organization.
    You''ll also need to have a sense of your learners, the learning environment,

    invoking experiential learning and connecting to real-world situations and problems.
    So, as you create your courses and classify them, be sure to think about how it
    will be possible for your learners to put learning blocks together across a curriculum
    and prepare themselves to be completely autonomous.'

    about right now. After all, aren't you just putting together a list of courses?
    Yes and no. The list cannot be properly categorized if you do not know its ultimate
    purpose, its level, and what you want your students to do with the knowledge.
    This is particularly the case as you start thinking about ways to build on knowledge
    and have your students develop knowledge that will have real-world implications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to maintain accreditation, colleges and universities must undergo periodic
    reviews. With the proliferation of online courses, it is more important than ever
    to clearly map out an overall curriculum and course goals, and ensure that courses
    align with the institutional mission and vision, along with long-term goals and
    objectives. Further, with the need to be flexible with synchronous and asynchronous
    course delivery, it is important to demonstrate that you are including faculty
    training. Most accredited organizations that offer online instruction require
    instructors to take and successfully complete, at the very minimum, a course in
    the subject. They may also take courses covering the basics of instructional design
    and student motivation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best strategies for demonstrating that your courses and curriculum
    have been designed with a plan in mind and that they adhere to a mission is to
    create categories and subcategories that then appear on your Moodle site. If you
    use personalized learning that allows students to advance to higher levels of
    learning once they have demonstrated mastery of concepts or skills, this is a
    time to map out competency frameworks. Basically, each learning objective aligns
    with an assessment, and when the assessment is completed with a passing score,
    that competency has been satisfied, and the student can move on to the next section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every Moodle course must be assigned to at least one course category. The categories
    should correspond to your institution's course catalog, the document that you
    prepare for your self-review study, and then later, the document you submit to
    the accreditation team. This is an excellent example of how Moodle's organization
    can help you achieve consistency in all the places where you display courses,
    ranging from the course catalog to the strategic planning documents. Moodle can
    function as your foundation.

    or weeks your course will have. You can change the number of weeks or topics in
    a course whenever you want. If you increase the number, blank weeks/topics are
    added. If you decrease the number, weeks/topics are deleted, or so it seems. One
    of Moodle's quirks is that when you decrease the number of sections in a course,
    the topics that are dropped are not really deleted; they're just not displayed
    to the students. If you increase the number of topics, those hidden topics will
    again be displayed to the students with their content intact. Also, teachers who
    are in editing mode will see the dropped topics as grayed out, in a section called
    **Orphan**. The teacher can still access and edit those orphaned topics.

    hide topics or weeks, students can't see them, but the teacher can. When a section
    disappears because the number of weeks/topics in the course is reduced, it is
    unseen to everyone, even the teacher. The only way to bring it back is to increase
    the number of weeks/topics.
