Web content is now viewed in a myriad of ways by users with mobile phones, tablets, and even watches. Content on the Internet may not be consumed directly by humans at all—web services now power apps on our phones and almost every device that's part of the emerging and much lauded Internet of Things.</p><p>Drupal is evolving to reflect the changes we're seeing on the Internet as a whole, and Drupal 8 represents a big technological leap forward for open source content management systems. Its central focus is shifting from building websites, where desktop users came first, to supporting a whole range of ways in which content is now consumed on the Internet.</p><p>Drupal 8 comes with mobile-first, responsive themes by default. HTML5 is baked in, making Drupal content viewable by any user with a device that supports a web browser. RESTful web services are included in Drupal 8 core, meaning that Drupal content can be consumed through apps or other machines, as well as through the traditional web browser.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, major changes in the way Drupal is used are accompanied by some major changes in the way you will be working with it as a developer. This book will guide you through the exciting and far-reaching changes that Drupal 8 brings. You'll learn how to build complex, powerful web applications by configuring Drupal without having to write any code. You'll also learn how to create responsive, mobile-first themes, write custom modules, and manage your Drupal projects using modern incremental development techniques.</p><p>If you're already a PHP developer, Drupal 8 is going to be an exhilarating ride for you. Modern object-orientated programming techniques that use many elements of the Symfony PHP framework are going to help you write more flexible, robust, and reusable code. The Drupal community will be attracting more and more non-Drupal PHP programmers over the coming years, as it's more elegant and cutting edge than before. Whether or not you're part of the Drupal community, there has never been a better, more exciting time to get heavily involved.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Setting Up a Drupal Development Environment">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Setting Up a Drupal Development Environment</em></span>, walks you through the setup of a Drupal development environment as the professionals do it. You'll be introduced to a range of powerful tools that will make Drupal development more efficient and fun, and it will also help you drastically improve your productivity.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Custom Module Development">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom Module Development</em></span>, gets stuck into code. You'll be writing object-orientated code to make your modules more flexible and extendable. The chapter will also cover test-driven development, which is the basis of everything you need to deploy Drupal sites that consistently do what they should.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Drupal Views and Configuration Management">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Drupal Views and Configuration Management</em></span>, showcases the new configuration management system of Drupal 8, which allows you to properly separate site configuration from site content. You'll see how content types and field configuration is now done using a markup language called YAML.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Introduction to the Field Types API and Developing the Custom Field Module">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to the Field Types API and Developing the Custom Field Module</em></span>, explores how HTML5 support has been built into Drupal 8 and the new features that this provides. You'll be building a new custom field to showcase some of these features.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Theming in Drupal 8">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Theming in Drupal 8</em></span>, introduces the Twig templating engine and guides you through building a fully responsive theme. The chapter will also cover theme hooks that allow you to further modify the default look and feel of Drupal 8.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Enhancing the Content Author's User Experience">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Enhancing the Content Author's User Experience</em></span>, illustrates how Drupal 8 vastly improves the administration interface, where users have often been sadly forgotten in previous versions of Drupal. Drupal 8 isn't just for end users, it's also for editors, moderators, and administrators of the site too.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Adding Media to Our Site">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding Media to Our Site</em></span>, helps you launch a multimedia campaign by introducing a range of media elements to your site. You'll learn how to make your site more compelling and convey the required message, not only in words, but also in other types of media.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. How Does It Taste? – Getting Feedback">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>How Does it Taste? – Getting Feedback</em></span>, walks you through the built-in functionality of Drupal 8 to get feedback from your users. This chapter will also cover starting a two-way conversation by building a form to help your users communicate with you and submit their views or requests.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Advanced Views Development">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Views Development</em></span>, takes an in-depth look at the Views module, which you'll use in many of your Drupal projects. We'll look at how to create a custom Views plugin that uses jQuery.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Drupal Project Management and Collaboration">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Drupal Project Management and Collaboration</em></span>, introduces you to a place where you can make some best friends—the Drupal community. We'll look at tools for collaboration, how to get more involved in the Drupal community, and how to work as a team to build something amazing.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Searching Your Site with the Search API Module">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Searching Your Site with the Search API Module</em></span>, introduces some powerful search functionality provided by the Search API, a framework for extending Drupal's standard search. We'll look at what it can achieve on its own, and then take a look at Apache Solr, a third-party search engine that will make your search functionality lightning fast.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. RESTful Web Services in Drupal">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>RESTful Web Services in Drupal</em></span>, breaks down all the boundaries of your Drupal development. You'll create a custom API using REST and an AngularJS app that will consume content from Drupal using the API. Now Drupal doesn't just need to power websites—it could power almost anything.</p><p><a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Pop Quiz Answers">Appendix</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Pop Quiz Answers</em></span>, covers all the answers enlisted in the pop quiz sections of the book.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To follow the examples in this book, you'll need a computer on which you can set up your own development environment with a number of useful tools. All these tools are either open source or have free equivalents. The PhpStorm IDE mentioned in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Setting Up a Drupal Development Environment">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Setting Up a Drupal Development Environment</em></span>, is a proprietary and fairly expensive piece of software, but you could also use NetBeans or Eclipse as alternative IDEs, as they have comparable features.</p><p>You're also going to need an Internet connection. Many of the examples in this book rely on external services such as GitHub or PuPHPet and you'll have to do some fairly large downloads if you're installing some of the recommended software packages from scratch.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is aimed at people who would like to start configuring, developing, or theming with Drupal 8. Although no experience with previous versions of Drupal is necessary, you'll find many familiar Drupal concepts if you've already used Drupal 7.</p><p>For development-focused chapters, it's assumed that you have some prior knowledge of PHP and are aware of modern PHP development practices. The theming chapters will assume that you are familiar with HTML and CSS. Some experience using the command line would be useful, but not essential.</p><p>Above all, an inquisitive mind, a readiness to make mistakes, and an enthusiasm to embark on a great Drupal adventure are most important.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Sections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Sections</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find several headings that appear frequently (Time for action, What just happened?, Pop quiz, and Have a go hero).</p><p>To give clear instructions on how to complete a procedure or task, we use these sections as follows:</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2013; heading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec06"/>Time for action – heading</h1></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Action 1</li><li class="listitem">Action 2</li><li class="listitem">Action 3</li></ol></div><p>Instructions often need some extra explanation to ensure they make sense, so they are followed with these sections:</p><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec02"/><span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span></h2></div></div></div><p>This section explains the working of the tasks or instructions that you have just completed.</p><p>You will also find some other learning aids in the book, for example:</p></div><div class="section" title="Pop quiz – heading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec03"/>Pop quiz – heading</h2></div></div></div><p>These are short multiple-choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding.</p></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero – heading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec04"/>Have a go hero – heading</h2></div></div></div><p>These are practical challenges that give you ideas to experiment with what you have learned.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec07"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>You will also find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Navigate to the module page on Drupal to get the link to the latest packaged <code class="literal">tar.gz</code> file."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;content 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;content 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>git checkout [filename]</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>git reset --hard</strong></span>
</pre></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> and then re-index your content."</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
