- en: 'Hi, all! *From PHP to Ruby to Rails* is a guide for people who have a PHP background
    and understanding but wish to extend their knowledge to another object-oriented
    programming language: Ruby. Ruby is a programming language originally created
    by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and publicly released in 1995\. Since its inception,
    Ruby has been a very verbose language, and the open source community has adopted
    this trait to make Ruby programs very explicit regarding the intent of each line
    of code. This guide will not only teach you Ruby’s language features but also
    help you get into the mindset of Ruby application development. Along this journey
    of learning Ruby, you will also learn the basics of Ruby on Rails, a framework
    for creating web applications developed by David Heinemeier Hansson and released
    as an open source tool in 2004\. With the growing popularity and adoption of Ruby
    and Ruby on Rails by tech companies, there is a lot of demand for Ruby developers
    all over the world. Whether you’re curious about Ruby and Ruby on Rails or want
    to find out whether Ruby is for you, this guide is for you.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need Ruby 3.1.1 installed (follow the instructions in the book if needed
    to set up Ruby). You will also need Git installed on your computer as Ruby libraries
    (gems) rely on git to obtain its source code. If you’re using macOS, you will
    require either Xcode command-line tools or Xcode itself to be installed before
    you can use Ruby. Though not compulsory, you should also install `rbenv` to allow
    yourself to install different versions of Ruby.
