<h1 id="_idParaDest-182" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Configuring Educational Features</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle supports a wide range of tools and features that require administrative attention, some only once, others regularly. Due to the volume of configuration areas, we have divided the topic into educational and technical configurations, each represented by a <span class="No-Break" lang="">dedicated chapter:</span></p>
<div>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1 – Educational configuration topics</p>
<p lang="en-GB">This chapter deals with configuring educational settings. Therefore, we will cover the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">Configuring <span class="No-Break" lang="">collaboration tools</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Configuring content <span class="No-Break" lang="">creation features</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Configuring grades <span class="No-Break" lang="">and assessments</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Managing skills <span class="No-Break" lang="">and incentives</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Configuring educational settings usually requires input from domain experts, such as curriculum planners, content creators, or assessors. It has proven beneficial to liaise with these specialists to ensure the optimal setup for your <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle system.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">By the end of this chapter, you should be in a good position to approach your colleagues, ask the right educational questions, and implement <span class="No-Break" lang="">their requirements.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-183" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Configuring collaboration tools</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">One of Moodle’s many <a id="_idIndexMarker824"/>advantages is its built-in support for collaboration among learners and instructors. This ranges from several collaborative course activities, such as <strong class="bold" lang="">Forum</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Wiki</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Glossary</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">Database</strong>, the ability to run activities in group mode, and support for groupings. Additionally, there are three social tools in Moodle that have to be configured by the administrator: <strong class="bold" lang="">blogs</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">comments</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">tags</strong>. We will discuss these in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsections.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-184" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Configuring blogs</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The <a id="_idIndexMarker825"/>blogging mechanism<a id="_idIndexMarker826"/> provided<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> to users in Moodle allows them to create personal and public entries and posts relating <span class="No-Break" lang="">to courses.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Blogs are a means for users to express themselves either in the form of a learning journal or as a personal account <span class="No-Break" lang="">of events.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">As an administrator, you must ensure that <strong class="bold" lang="">Enable blogs</strong> is turned on in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced features</strong>. Next, you should navigate to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Appearance</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Blog</strong> to configure the following settings, which apply to all <span class="No-Break" lang="">blog users:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer238">
<img alt="Figure 9.2 – Configuring blogs " height="1378" src="image/Figure_9.02_B18779.jpg" width="1635"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – Configuring blogs</p>
<p lang="en-GB">There are<a id="_idIndexMarker828"/> four types of <a id="_idIndexMarker829"/>settings that you <span class="No-Break" lang="">should double-check:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Enable blog associations</strong>: If checked, course and activity blogs become available, which allow learners to choose link entries to a course or course module. If unchecked, all blog posts will be converted into user blog posts. This setting can be overridden locally via the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moodle/blog:associatecourse</strong> and <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="source-inline" lang="">moodle/blog:associatemodule</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> capabilities.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Blog visibility</strong>: What you choose here depends on your organization’s policy and how blogs are used as part of the <span class="No-Break" lang="">learning process.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">External blogs</strong>: Moodle supports external blogs, such as those from WordPress. If enabled, users can link external blogs via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Register an external blog</strong> link in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Preferences</strong> menu. The entries will be shown as if they had been entered in the Moodle blog but cannot <span class="No-Break" lang="">be modified.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Blog comments</strong>: If <a id="_idIndexMarker830"/>enabled, others can <a id="_idIndexMarker831"/>provide comments on blog posts; for instance, a teacher can leave private or public feedback on a journal entry. You can further specify whether the comments count should <span class="No-Break" lang="">be shown.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">We have just come across comments in blogs, which are the second collaboration tool to <span class="No-Break" lang="">be configured.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-185" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Configuring comments</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle<a id="_idIndexMarker832"/> comes <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>with a generic comments functionality <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>independent of the one in the blogging tools. It allows you to place the <strong class="bold" lang="">Comments</strong> block in any context of the system, such as in a course or an <span class="No-Break" lang="">individual activity.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Comments are remarks that can be attached to various <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle artifacts.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Enable comments</strong> parameter under <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced features</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">There are several areas where additional comment-related settings can be set; for instance, when they are included in backups or supported by certain activities. You can also look at a report by going to <strong class="bold" lang="">Reports</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Comments</strong>, where you will see all the comments throughout the system. You might want to check this frequently in case anything offensive or inappropriate has <span class="No-Break" lang="">been entered.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You can search for <strong class="source-inline" lang="">comments</strong> using the <strong class="bold" lang="">Search</strong> box to see these settings. As always, these options can be overridden locally via the respective <span class="No-Break" lang="">role capabilities.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The third and last collaboration activity in Moodle is tagging, which we deal with in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-186" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Configuring tags</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Tagging<a id="_idIndexMarker835"/> is the process of describing artifacts or users using keywords. These <a id="_idIndexMarker836"/>tags are then harnessed to search for, share, and perform various collaborative activities to <span class="No-Break" lang="">match interests.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Tagging <a id="_idIndexMarker837"/>is the process of describing artifacts or users <span class="No-Break" lang="">using keywords.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Users create <a id="_idIndexMarker838"/>their own tags that represent their personal or educational interests. However, as an educational institution, you might want to create site-wide tags that can be used in addition to the user-defined tags or even limit tagging to a set of standard tags. Examples of global tags include organization-related keywords, topics your entity specializes in, campaigns your company runs, and newsworthy topics relevant to <span class="No-Break" lang="">your institution.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">As with blogs and comments, tags can be enabled (default) and disabled for the entire site via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Enable tags functionality</strong> parameter under <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced features</strong>. The following diagram illustrates how tags are organized <span class="No-Break" lang="">in Moodle:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer239">
<img alt="Figure 9.3 – Moodle tags " height="956" src="image/Figure_9.03_B18779.jpg" width="1047"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.3 – Moodle tags</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Tags are<a id="_idIndexMarker839"/> organized in <strong class="bold" lang="">tag collections</strong>. A tag belongs <a id="_idIndexMarker840"/>to one<a id="_idIndexMarker841"/> collection; a tag cannot belong to more than one collection. There are several predefined tag areas, each representing Moodle features that support tags. Each <strong class="bold" lang="">tag area</strong> has <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>an associated tag collection; one tag collection can be associated with multiple tag areas. To see the tags, tag areas, and tag collections in action, navigate to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Appearance</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage tags</strong>, where you will see <span class="No-Break" lang="">the following:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer240">
<img alt="Figure 9.4 – Managing tags I " height="994" src="image/Figure_9.04_B18779.jpg" width="1209"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.4 – Managing tags I</p>
<p lang="en-GB">There are two<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> tag collections <a id="_idIndexMarker844"/>at the top of the screen, one of which has been added via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Add tag collection</strong> link. To associate a tag collection with a tag area, you need to select it in the respective column in the tag areas table. The <strong class="bold" lang="">Standard tags usage</strong> setting indicates how tags are being dealt with when entered in the tag area: they can be proposed once you start typing (<strong class="bold" lang="">Suggest</strong>), only standard tags can be selected (<strong class="bold" lang="">Force</strong>), or no tags are shown (<span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Don’t suggest</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">).</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Disabling a tag area (via the standard eye symbol) completely hides the tagging functionality from this component. For example, when turning off tagging in <strong class="bold" lang="">User interests</strong>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker845"/>respective entry in the user profile won’t be <span class="No-Break" lang="">available anymore.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">When you select the <a id="_idIndexMarker846"/>name of a tag collection, you will see all tags of <span class="No-Break" lang="">that collection:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer241">
<img alt="Figure 9.5 – Managing tags II " height="374" src="image/Figure_9.05_B18779.jpg" width="1092"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.5 – Managing tags II</p>
<p lang="en-GB">For each tag, the following settings/actions <span class="No-Break" lang="">are available:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Tag name</strong>: When selected, you see which users have been tagged with <span class="No-Break" lang="">this tag.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">First name / Surname</strong>: <span class="No-Break" lang="">Tag creator.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Count</strong>: This is the number of times the tag has been used throughout the site. This will be used as a basis for tag cloud sizes in the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Tag</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> block.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Flag</strong>: This shows whether the tag has been flagged as inappropriate and the number of times <span class="No-Break" lang="">in brackets.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Modified</strong>: This shows the last time the tag <span class="No-Break" lang="">was edited.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Standard</strong>: Standard tags are available to <span class="No-Break" lang="">all users.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Edit</strong>: You can alter the tag’s name, change its description, and select any <span class="No-Break" lang="">related tags.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Delete</strong>: This removes the tag from <span class="No-Break" lang="">the system.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">You can add<a id="_idIndexMarker847"/> standard tags via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Add standard tags</strong> link. If you identify any tags that should be combined, such as when a tag name has been misspelled, use the <strong class="bold" lang="">Combine selected</strong> button and select the tag that should <span class="No-Break" lang="">be kept.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">If you need to <a id="_idIndexMarker848"/>block users from tagging, you will need to create a separate role and adjust the two relevant capabilities, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moodle/tag:create</strong> and <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moodle/tag:edit</strong>. If you want tag names to keep the original casing as entered by the users who created them, ensure that the <strong class="bold" lang="">Keep tag name casing</strong> setting is ticked under <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Security</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Site </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">security settings</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This concludes this subsection on configuring tags and, thus, the section on administering collaborative Moodle tools. Next up is configuring the features required by your <span class="No-Break" lang="">content creators.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-187" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Configuring content creation features</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Course authors <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>heavily rely on the content creation tools made available to them. Moodle allows you to create content with built-in tools, incorporate content from external applications, and add structure and conditions among <span class="No-Break" lang="">content items.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">In this section, you will learn how to configure different content creation features, namely the content bank and H5P, LTI platforms and tools, filters, plagiarism prevention, and licenses. First, let’s configure some generic content <span class="No-Break" lang="">creation settings.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-188" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Configuring content creation settings</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Several site-wide settings <a id="_idIndexMarker850"/>impact content creation, which are <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Require activity description</strong>: Activities and resources do not require a description by default. To enforce a descriptive explanation, you must enable the parameter in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Common </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">activity settings</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Completion tracking</strong>: Course and activity completion allows authors to set completion criteria for activities and courses. It is recommended to leave the feature enabled in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced features</strong>, where you can also find the <strong class="bold" lang="">Default completion </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">tracking</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> option.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Restricting access</strong>: Inside Moodle courses, a course author can restrict access <a id="_idIndexMarker851"/>to individual activities or resources. The types of available restrictions can be configured by navigating to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Availability restrictions</strong> | <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Manage restrictions</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">:</span></li>
</ul>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.6 – Managing availability restrictions</p>
<p lang="en-GB">You only have the option to show and hide each restriction; by default, all the plugins are enabled. Some restrictions require other elements to be present or configured, respectively. For example, groups and groupings only appear in a course’s <strong class="bold" lang="">Access restriction</strong> when they exist in a particular course. Ensure <strong class="bold" lang="">Enable restricted access</strong> is turned on in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced features</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">A popular third-party availability<a id="_idIndexMarker852"/> restriction is <strong class="bold" lang="">Restriction by language</strong> (<a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/availability_language">moodle.org/plugins/availability_language</a>), which will be described in more detail in the <em class="italic" lang="">Managing localization</em> section of <a href="B18779_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor204"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Configuring </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Technical Features</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Stealth activities</strong>: These are available but invisible activities, previously known as orphans. These are useful if course creators wish to hide activities and provide<a id="_idIndexMarker853"/> links from elsewhere, such as a page resource or a <span class="No-Break" lang="">text block.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Each activity or resource has a settings page in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong>. The majority of settings are default values that are often accompanied by the following additional value states, <span class="No-Break" lang="">if applicable:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Enabled</strong>: If set, the standard setting will be ticked; otherwise, it will <span class="No-Break" lang="">be unticked</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced</strong>: If set, the teacher has to select the <strong class="bold" lang="">Show more…</strong> link to see them, which is recommended for settings <span class="No-Break" lang="">used infrequently</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Locked</strong>: If set, the teacher cannot alter the setting; for example, if you wish to enforce a description for all activities across <span class="No-Break" lang="">the system</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">The following is an example from the <strong class="bold" lang="">Assignment</strong> activity where all three states are shown on the <span class="No-Break" lang="">right-hand side:</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">Once you have checked and configured these general course and activity settings, we can configure the content bank in general and H5P <span class="No-Break" lang="">in particular.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-189" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Configuring the content bank and H5P</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">H5P lets <a id="_idIndexMarker854"/>your course authors create, share, and reuse rich, interactive, and mobile-friendly HTML5 content. In Moodle, a content<a id="_idIndexMarker855"/> bank has been implemented to incorporate H5P content, as illustrated in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">Moodle supports the concept <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>of <strong class="bold" lang="">content integrations</strong>, where each integration is represented as a separate entity.

<p lang="en-GB">H5P represents interactive content that’s been stored, edited, and created in Moodle. Another type of content integration is LTI, which will be dealt with in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-190" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Configuring LTI platforms and tools</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">According <a id="_idIndexMarker863"/>to IMS, <strong class="bold" lang="">Learning Tools Interoperability</strong> (<strong class="bold" lang="">LTI</strong>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker864"/>standard for learning tool interoperability to allow remote tools and content to be integrated into a Learning Management System. Moodle supports depreciated versions of LTI and the<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> latest <strong class="bold" lang="">LTI Advantage</strong> (core LTI 1.3 packaged with some essential services). Moodle can act as an LTI platform (external content can be used in Moodle) and LTI tool (Moodle content can be used in other <span class="No-Break" lang="">LTI platforms).</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Legacy LTI uses the terms <strong class="bold" lang="">Consumer</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Provider</strong>, whereas LTI Advantage uses <strong class="bold" lang="">Platform</strong> <span class="No-Break" lang="">and </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Tool</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">We will use these new terms going forward, starting with Moodle operating as an <span class="No-Break" lang="">LTI platform.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Moodle as an LTI platform</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">For <a id="_idIndexMarker866"/>Moodle to<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> act as <a id="_idIndexMarker868"/>an LTI platform, course authors must use the <strong class="bold" lang="">External tool</strong> activity. The simplified data flow between Moodle (LTI platform) and an external system (LTI tool) is depicted in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer247">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.11 – Moodle as an LTI platform I</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The tool has to be connected to Moodle via a URL and some credentials; the latter can be a consumer key/shared secret pair, an RSA key, or a keyset URL. Once the connection has been established, learning <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>content is embedded via the aforementioned external tool activity. Additional data might be transferred, which are usually results to be stored locally in <span class="No-Break" lang="">the gradebook.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">As an<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> administrator, you have to configure external content providers, which will then appear in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Preconfigured tool</strong> dropdown in the activity inside a course. Go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">External tool</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage tools</strong>, where you have multiple options to add <span class="No-Break" lang="">new providers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Add LTI Advantage</strong>: If the provider supports this workflow, enter a <strong class="bold" lang="">Tool URL</strong>; you will be directed to the tool registration page, where you will be guided through the <span class="No-Break" lang="">registration steps.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Add Legacy LTI</strong>: Moodle supports deprecated LTI versions; depending on the current version, either a key/secret pair has to be provided (version 1.1), or a registration process similar to LTI Advantage will be kicked off (<span class="No-Break" lang="">version 2.0).</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Configure tool manually</strong>: If neither of the preceding two options works, you must provide the tool parameters manually. The external tool settings are well documented <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/External_tool_settings"><span class="No-Break" lang="">docs.moodle.org/en/External_tool_settings</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Added tools <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>will first be given a pending state, which allows you to review the tool configuration and the privacy and services granted, and apply possible modifications before activating the tool via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage preconfigured </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">tools</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> link.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">For a tool to appear as a separate item in the activity chooser, change the <strong class="bold" lang="">Tool configuration usage</strong> setting to <strong class="bold" lang="">Show in activity chooser and as a </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">preconfigured tool</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">Now <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>that we <a id="_idIndexMarker873"/>have configured Moodle to act as an LTI platform, let’s look at the opposite, where Moodle is the LTI tool, provisioning content for <span class="No-Break" lang="">other systems.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Moodle as an LTI tool</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">For <a id="_idIndexMarker874"/>Moodle to <a id="_idIndexMarker875"/>operate <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>as an LTI tool, it is essential to understand the simplified data flow between an external platform (LTI consumer) and Moodle (LTI producer), as shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer249">

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.13 – Moodle as an LTI tool I</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>LTI tool and<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> the LTI platform <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>must register with one another; they effectively sign a security contract that allows communication and data exchange between the two systems. Content (an entire course or a single activity) and, optionally, grades are shared by the LTI tool and utilized in the LTI platform. When both LTI sites are Moodle systems, this process is identical to the Moodle as LTI platform workflow. For users of the LTI platform to access published content in the LTI tool, an authentication and enrolment mechanism have to be activated. These two steps and further configurations to enable Moodle as an LTI tool are <span class="No-Break" lang="">outlined here:</span></p>
<ol>
<li lang="en-GB">Go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Authentication</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage authentication</strong> and enable the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">LTI</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> plugin.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Enrolments</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage enroll plugins</strong> and enable <strong class="bold" lang="">Publish as LTI tool</strong>. Configure the user default values in the plugin settings with <span class="No-Break" lang="">your details.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Enrolments</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Publish as LTI tool</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Tool registration</strong> and select <strong class="bold" lang="">Register </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">a platform</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-GB">After providing a name, Moodle will automatically generate tool details, which must be entered into the LTI platform. Once the tool has been set up in the platform, details must be recorded on the <strong class="bold" lang="">Platform details</strong> tab to complete the registration. For dynamic registrations, this information is entered automatically; for manual registrations, it must be copied and <span class="No-Break" lang="">entered manually.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">We have<a id="_idIndexMarker880"/> registered two platforms on<a id="_idIndexMarker881"/> the right-hand side of the following screenshot (one active and one pending).

<ol>
<li lang="en-GB" value="4">Inside a course, teachers can publish content (the entire course or an individual activity) via <strong class="bold" lang="">Published as LTI tools</strong>. Here, grade and user synchronization must be configured. <strong class="bold" lang="">User synchronization mode</strong> determines how the enrollment of remote users has to <span class="No-Break" lang="">be handled.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">When remote users access a shared activity or course for the first time, Moodle will either use an existing account or create a new one. How this user account provisioning is<a id="_idIndexMarker883"/> carried out (automatic or user-prompted) is determined by the settings in <strong class="bold" lang="">Teacher first launch provisioning mode</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Student first launch </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">provisioning mode</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-GB">While<a id="_idIndexMarker884"/> teachers carry out <em class="italic" lang="">steps 4</em> and <em class="italic" lang="">5</em>, they usually <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>require assistance with this partly technical procedure. The preceding list only crudely outlines the setup steps of the LTI tool when using dynamic registration. At <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Publish_as_LTI_tool">docs.moodle.org/en/Publish_as_LTI_tool</a>, you can find very well-written documentation on other LTI setups, such as manual registration, sharing access, and user provisioning, as well as information on <span class="No-Break" lang="">legacy LTI.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Tip</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">It is recommended that the <strong class="bold" lang="">Allow frame embedding</strong> setting is enabled by going to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Security</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">HTTP security</strong> so that tools are displayed within a frame rather than in a <span class="No-Break" lang="">new window.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">LTI is a powerful standard that opens up your Moodle system to grant access to and from external content. Filters, which we will cover next, transform content inside your <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle instance.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-191" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Configuring filters</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Filters scan<a id="_idIndexMarker886"/> any text entered via the Atto editor and <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>automatically transform it into different and often more complex forms. For example, entries or concepts in glossaries are automatically hyperlinked in text, URLs pointing to MP3 files become an embedded audio player, mathematical equations are represented as visual formulae, uploaded videos are given play controls, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">so on.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle ships several filters, which can be accessed by navigating to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Filters</strong> | <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Manage filters</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">:</span></p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.15 – Filter configuration</p>
<p lang="en-GB">By <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>default, all the<a id="_idIndexMarker889"/> filters are disabled. You can enable them by changing the <strong class="bold" lang="">Active?</strong> status from <strong class="bold" lang="">Disabled</strong> to <strong class="bold" lang="">On</strong> or <strong class="bold" lang="">Off, but available</strong>. If the status is set to <strong class="bold" lang="">On</strong>, the filter is activated throughout the system but can be deactivated locally. If the status is set to <strong class="bold" lang="">Off, but available</strong>, the filter is not activated but can be enabled locally. Managing local filter settings requires the <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moodle/filter:manage</strong> capability, which is allowed by default for the <strong class="bold" lang="">Manager</strong> and <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Teacher</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> roles.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Filters used throughout the LMS and by most of your users should be turned on. Typical candidates are <strong class="bold" lang="">Multimedia plugins</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Display H5P</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Display emoticons as images</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">Multi-language content</strong>. Filters that are only used by some users should not be activated but made available locally, such as <strong class="bold" lang="">TeX notation</strong>, to deal with mathematical or scientific notation. Enabled filters might also be switched off temporarily at the activity level, for instance, <strong class="bold" lang="">Glossary auto-linking</strong> in an online exam. Activating some filters might trigger the appearance of an editor button, such as <strong class="bold" lang="">Display emoticons as images</strong> (emoji selection) or <strong class="bold" lang="">TeX notation</strong> (<span class="No-Break" lang="">equation editor).</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You can change the order in which the filters are applied to text using the up and down arrows in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Order</strong> column. If a particular filter isn’t working, try moving it higher up <span class="No-Break" lang="">the list.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">The filtering mechanism operates on a first-come, first-served basis; if a filter detects a text element that has to be transformed, it will do this before the next filter <span class="No-Break" lang="">is applied.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Each filter <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>can be configured to be applied to <strong class="bold" lang="">Content and headings</strong> or <strong class="bold" lang="">Content</strong> only; that is, filters will be ignored in the names of <span class="No-Break" lang="">activity modules.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Applying filters to headings as well as content can significantly increase the load on your server, so use <span class="No-Break" lang="">them sparingly.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Some filters <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>provide settings that either indicate to which text format the filter should apply or are specific to the filter; the latter is described in detail in the respective Moodle Docs. In addition to filter-specific settings, Moodle provides several settings that are shared among all filters. These can be accessed via <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Filters</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Common filter settings</strong> and are <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Filter uploaded files</strong>: By default, only text entered via the Moodle editor is filtered. If you wish to include uploaded files, you can choose any of them from the <strong class="bold" lang="">HTML files only</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">All </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">files</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> options.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Filter match once per page</strong>: Enable this setting if the filter should stop analyzing text after it finds a match; that is, only the first occurrence will <span class="No-Break" lang="">be transformed.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Filter match once per text</strong>: Enable this setting if the filter should only generate a single link for the first matching text instance found in each text item on a page. This setting is ignored if the <strong class="bold" lang="">Filter match once per page</strong> parameter <span class="No-Break" lang="">is enabled.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Filter navigation within system context</strong>: Filters are context-sensitive, which might cause performance issues when filtering is enabled for headings. Selecting this option should reduce the number of filter operations <span class="No-Break" lang="">to pages.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">The following diagram provides a summary of how filters are applied, considering the order of filters, filter matching, and <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>what text the<a id="_idIndexMarker893"/> filter is applied to (content and heading or <span class="No-Break" lang="">content only):</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">Plagiarism prevention is next on the (long) list of content creation topics that require <span class="No-Break" lang="">admin attention.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-192" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Configuring plagiarism prevention</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The<a id="_idIndexMarker894"/> idea behind plagiarism prevention is<a id="_idIndexMarker895"/> to check students’ submitted content against others’ work – the higher the overlap, the more likely the content has been plagiarized. This detection can either be for users’ content in Moodle or through <span class="No-Break" lang="">public resources.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Plagiarism prevention <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>must be enabled by selecting the <strong class="bold" lang="">Enable plagiarism plugins</strong> parameter at <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced features</strong>. Once this occurs, you can access any installed plagiarism prevention plugins when navigating to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plagiarism</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">plagiarism plugins</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">At the time of writing, about a dozen plugins are available at <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:plagiarism">moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:plagiarism</a> that cater to plagiarism prevention. The two most popular <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>are <strong class="bold" lang="">Turnitin</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Ouriginal</strong> (previously <strong class="bold" lang="">Urkund</strong>). Both systems <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>are commercial tools and require a paid subscription. Once installed and configured, the plagiarism prevention functionality will be available as part of the <strong class="bold" lang="">Assignment</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Forum</strong> modules <span class="No-Break" lang="">inside courses.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Another topic that requires agreement across the site and organization is which licenses are available in your Moodle system; this is the topic of the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-193" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Managing licenses</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">A license <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>can be selected when adding a file via <strong class="bold" lang="">File picker</strong>. This information will then be attached to the metadata of the file. To configure the licenses that are available to your users, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">License</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">License manager</strong>, where all available licenses <span class="No-Break" lang="">are listed:</span></p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.17 – Managing licenses</p>
<p lang="en-GB">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>create new licenses via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Create license</strong> button, where you have to provide the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">License short name</strong>: Internal <span class="No-Break" lang="">license name</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">License full name</strong>: Display <span class="No-Break" lang="">license name</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">License source</strong>: The URL where the license’s terms and conditions can <span class="No-Break" lang="">be found</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">License version</strong>: Publication date of the license version <span class="No-Break" lang="">being utilized</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">The license manager can edit and delete manually added licenses; those that ship with Moodle can’t. Except for the default site license, all licenses can be <span class="No-Break" lang="">disabled (hidden).</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">The license attached to an uploaded file does not affect its visibility; it simply creates the default when it’s <span class="No-Break" lang="">reused elsewhere.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>select <strong class="bold" lang="">Default site license</strong> under <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">License</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">License settings</strong>. By default, the last license selected by a user is pre-selected when uploading a file via the file picker. If the <strong class="bold" lang="">Remember user license preference</strong> setting is disabled, the default site license <span class="No-Break" lang="">is pre-selected.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This concludes this section on content creation features, where we covered configuring the content bank and H5P, LTI platforms and tools, filters, plagiarism prevention, and licenses. One particular type of content – assessments and grading thereof – has been ignored so far and will be covered in the following <span class="No-Break" lang="">dedicated section.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-194" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Configuring grades and assessments</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">In addition to <a id="_idIndexMarker902"/>learning per se, assessment <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>is a critical requirement in educational settings. Moodle offers a wide range of tools to facilitate formative, interim, and summative assessments and handles the inevitable grades that go <span class="No-Break" lang="">with it.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">In this section, we will cover the administrative elements of the gradebook before we deal with assessments, where we will cover how to configure assignments, quizzes and the question bank, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">SCORM packages.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-195" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Configuring grades and the gradebook</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The<a id="_idIndexMarker904"/> gradebook is one of the most important constructs in any LMS, and Moodle is no exception. The Moodle gradebook is a powerful, flexible, and accurate grade management system. Its flexibility and customizability result in a very high degree of complexity. Consequently, a considerable number of administrative settings are at your disposal that affect how teachers, trainers, and assessors use grades throughout <span class="No-Break" lang="">the system.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Most parameters <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>are tightly linked to the gradebook, and teachers at the course level deal with the related reports. A site-wide agreement on default values and global settings for grades should be in place for <span class="No-Break" lang="">your organization.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">A <strong class="bold" lang="">gradebook</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker906"/> a container that holds grades for all the learners <span class="No-Break" lang="">in Moodle.</span></p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">A <strong class="bold" lang="">grade</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker907"/>item in <span class="No-Break" lang="">the gradebook.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The following is a <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>high-level overview of grades and all relevant <span class="No-Break" lang="">gradebook elements:</span></p>

We will only briefly describe each element in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Grades</strong> tab and <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>highlight some key parameters, which are listed <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">General settings</strong>: These parameters influence the gradebook and grades in general. <strong class="bold" lang="">Enable publishing</strong> (the ability to publish results via external URLs) is a setting that is turned off by default and is required regularly. Another setting that is changed frequently is <strong class="bold" lang="">Navigation method</strong>, in which most users prefer the <strong class="bold" lang="">Tabs</strong> option as it is consistent with the rest <span class="No-Break" lang="">of Moodle.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Grade category settings</strong>: Grades are organized into categories; you can set the relevant settings here. Different grading strategies can be leveraged with the gradebook’s aggregation system, such as sum-of-points <span class="No-Break" lang="">or percentage-category.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Grade item settings</strong>: These are settings that impact individual grades and <span class="No-Break" lang="">grade items.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Scales</strong>: Here, you can specify site-wide scales used for grading and rating. The global scales are often linked to qualifications offered by <span class="No-Break" lang="">your organization.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Outcomes</strong>: Outcomes are used by most vocational and some academic curricula to specify the expected competencies or goals of a subject being taught. Outcomes have to be enabled by going to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Advanced features</strong>. Most organizations prefer to use the more powerful competencies instead <span class="No-Break" lang="">of outcomes.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Letters</strong>: Many education systems use letters (A, A-, B+, …, and F) to grade items. Here, you specify which percentage range corresponds to which <span class="No-Break" lang="">grading letter.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle comes with several predefined gradebook reports. <strong class="bold" lang="">Report settings</strong> determines the appearance and content of the reports. If additional user-defined reports (plugins) are<a id="_idIndexMarker910"/> installed, this list is likely to have a separate configuration page for each report type (a good tutorial on creating custom reports can be found at <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Gradebook_reports">docs.moodle.org/dev/Gradebook_reports</a>). The different types of reports are <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Grader report</strong>: This setting includes whether to show calculations, show or hide icons, column averages, and so on. Teachers can override most of the settings in the <strong class="bold" lang="">My report </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">preferences</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> tab.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Grade history</strong>: The gradebook keeps track of all the changes that are made to the gradebook entries. Here, you can specify how many entries will be displayed on the page. You can <strong class="bold" lang="">Disable grade history</strong> by going to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Server</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Cleanup</strong>. On the same page, you can also specify the length of time the grade history should be kept (<strong class="bold" lang="">Grade </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">history lifetime</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">).</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Overview report</strong>: This consists of two settings that determine whether the ranking information is shown and how to deal with totals containing hidden <span class="No-Break" lang="">grades, respectively.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">User report</strong>: This shows the settings that determine whether the ranking information is shown and how to deal with <span class="No-Break" lang="">hidden items.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">We have only touched upon the customization options of the gradebook since the complete gradebook management heavily depends on grading strategies deployed in <span class="No-Break" lang="">your organization.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Next, we will deal with administering the three most used assessment tools in Moodle: assignments, quizzes, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and SCORM.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-196" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Configuring assignments</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">According to<a id="_idIndexMarker911"/> MoodleDocs, the <em class="italic" lang="">assignment activity allows students to submit work to their teacher for </em><em class="italic" lang="">grading</em>. A simplified assignment workflow is shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer255">
<img alt="Figure 9.19 – Assignment workflow" height="284" src="image/Figure_9.19_B18779.jpg" width="1209"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.19 – Assignment workflow</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The<a id="_idIndexMarker912"/> assignment workflow consists of the following <span class="No-Break" lang="">three steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li lang="en-GB" value="1">When an assignment is set by the teacher, a range of assignment settings have to be provided, covering instructions (<strong class="bold" lang="">What</strong>), various availability dates such as the start, due, and cut-off date (<strong class="bold" lang="">When</strong>), submission types, submission settings, and whether group submissions are supported (<strong class="bold" lang="">How</strong>), plus various <strong class="bold" lang="">Other</strong> settings, such <span class="No-Break" lang="">as notifications.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">The students then submit their work via one of the required submission types: online text, uploaded file(s), and/or an <span class="No-Break" lang="">auxiliary commentary.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Finally, the teacher provides feedback via one of the supported channels: comments, PDF annotations, offline grading sheets, and feedback via files. As described in the previous section, any given grades will automatically be transferred to the gradebook for the student <span class="No-Break" lang="">to review.</span></li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-GB">The elements that require administrator input are assignment settings, submission plugins, and <span class="No-Break" lang="">feedback plugins:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Assignment settings</strong>: In <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Assignment</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Assignment settings</strong>, you should specify the fields based on the requirements of your powers to be – for example, the wording of submission statements. In the second part of the screen, you can specify default values for the <span class="No-Break" lang="">assignment activity.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Submission plugins</strong>: Activated submission plugins dictate how students can submit their work. By default, the available options are online text, file, and comments. To configure each type, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Assignment</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Submission plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage assignment </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">submission plugins</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Feedback plugins</strong>: Activated <a id="_idIndexMarker913"/>feedback plugins dictate how teachers can grade, rate, and comment on submitted work. By default, the available options are comments, PDF annotations, offline grading worksheets, and file. To configure each type, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Assignment</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Submission plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage assignment </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">submission plugins</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Additional submission and feedback plugins can be found <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:assignfeedback"><span class="No-Break" lang="">moodle.org/plugins/?q=</span> type:assignfeedback</a> and <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:assignsubmission">moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:assignsubmission</a>, respectively. Further plugins can be installed to convert uploaded assignment submissions into PDF format for teachers to annotate. The list of available converters is available at <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Document converters</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage document converters</strong>. At the time of writing, two <strong class="bold" lang="">document converters</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>available as standard plugins: Google Drive (requires OAuth 2 Google service to be enabled) and Unoconv (requires Unoconv to be installed on <span class="No-Break" lang="">a server).</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">For PDF annotations to work correctly, <strong class="bold" lang="">Path to ghostscript</strong> must be set in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Server</strong> | <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">System paths</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The second popular assessment module in Moodle is the quiz activity, which is the topic of the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-197" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Configuring quizzes</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The<a id="_idIndexMarker915"/> quiz activity<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> enables teachers to create quizzes comprising questions of various types, including multiple-choice, matching, short-answer, numerical, and drag <span class="No-Break" lang="">and drop.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Creating a quiz is a two-step process. In the first step, content authors populate the question bank with questions. In the second step, teachers create the quiz activity, set its options that<a id="_idIndexMarker917"/> specify the rules for interacting with the quiz, and add questions from the <span class="No-Break" lang="">question bank.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Moodle stores questions used in quizzes in a question bank. Within the question bank, questions are organized <span class="No-Break" lang="">into categories.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Learners<a id="_idIndexMarker918"/> take quizzes in their standard browser or, if configured, in the Safe Exam Browser. The specified question behavior determines how submitted questions are dealt with. Grading takes place automatically (except for Essay type questions), and results are pushed to the gradebook as usual. A simplified quiz workflow is shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer256">
<img alt="Figure 9.20 – Quiz workflow " height="284" src="image/Figure_9.20_B18779.jpg" width="1214"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.20 – Quiz workflow</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Two parts of this process require configuration by the administrator: customizing the question bank and quiz activity and enabling the Safe <span class="No-Break" lang="">Exam Browser.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Customizing the question bank and quiz activity</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle has a <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>powerful question engine that supports a wide range of features, question types, and question behaviors. All three elements can be <span class="No-Break" lang="">configured separately:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Question bank features</strong>: At <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Question bank plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage question bank plugins</strong>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>can see all the available question bank features. You can change the column sort order and add question custom fields <span class="No-Break" lang="">if required.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Question types</strong>: At <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Question types</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage question types</strong>, you<a id="_idIndexMarker921"/> should disable any question types that are not in use and might want to change the default values for the <span class="No-Break" lang="">multiple-choice type.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Question behaviors</strong>: At <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Question behaviors</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage question behaviors</strong>, you should hide any methods through which submitted <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>questions are dealt with that are not in use in <span class="No-Break" lang="">your organization.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">In the<a id="_idIndexMarker923"/> following figure, you can (hopefully) see parts of the three <span class="No-Break" lang="">question-related elements:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer257">
<img alt="Figure 9.21 – Question bank plugins, question types, and question behaviors " height="696" src="image/Figure_9.21_B18779.jpg" width="1209"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.21 – Question bank plugins, question types, and question behaviors</p>
<p lang="en-GB">In true Moodle style, all three constructs are handled as plugins, and it is possible to add additional question bank plugins, question types, and question behaviors to <span class="No-Break" lang="">the system.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">There is one more setting you should have a look at, namely the <strong class="bold" lang="">Auto-save delay</strong> parameter in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Quiz</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General settings</strong>. The<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> specified value determines how often students’ work is automatically saved during <span class="No-Break" lang="">quiz attempts.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">The<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> short <strong class="bold" lang="">auto-save delay</strong> increases the server load but reduces the chance that students lose <span class="No-Break" lang="">their work.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">All other settings on this screen are default values for the quiz activity and do not require further explanation. The Safe Exam Browser is often utilized when quizzes are used for examinations, as covered in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Enabling the Safe Exam Browser</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">Quiz</strong> activity<a id="_idIndexMarker926"/> is used frequently for exams. Depending<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> on the physical setup and the importance of the examination, different levels of security may be required. The <strong class="bold" lang="">Quiz</strong> activity offers some built-in settings in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Extra restrictions on </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">attempts</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> section:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Require password</strong>: The password must be entered before access to the quiz <span class="No-Break" lang="">is granted</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Require network address</strong>: Access to the quiz is restricted to the specified IP address(es) on your LAN or <span class="No-Break" lang="">the internet</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Browser security</strong>: When the <strong class="bold" lang="">Full screen pop-up with some JavaScript security</strong> option is enabled, the quiz will only work in a JavaScript-enabled browser, shown full-screen, and, if technically possible, disallow certain operations such as copy <span class="No-Break" lang="">and paste</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">If these facilities are insufficient for specific exam setups, whether classroom-based or invigilated online, Moodle<a id="_idIndexMarker928"/> offers <strong class="bold" lang="">Safe Exam Browser</strong> (<strong class="bold" lang="">SEB</strong>) support. According to its website, <a href="http://safeexambrowser.org">safeexambrowser.org</a>, SEB is <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<p class="author-quote" lang="en-GB">“a web browser environment to carry out e-assessments safely. The software turns any computer temporarily into a secure workstation. It controls access to resources like system functions, other websites, and applications, and prevents unauthorized resources being used during an exam.”</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The <a id="_idIndexMarker929"/>architecture and components of SEB in connection <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>with Moodle are shown in the following schematic illustration (partly borrowed <span class="No-Break" lang="">from </span><a href="http://safeexambrowser.org"><span class="No-Break" lang="">safeexambrowser.org</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">):</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.22 – Safe Exam Browser architecture and components</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Kiosk Application</strong> locks down the computer or tablet and starts the SEB plus optional third-party applications. The <strong class="bold" lang="">Config</strong> file specifies the browser’s behavior, such as disabling features such as shortcuts, stopping audio, or hiding screen elements, and which external applications can be launched. <strong class="bold" lang="">SEB Browser</strong> loads and displays the Moodle quiz using a preset URL and hides any navigation elements such as the address bar, search engine field, and more. <strong class="bold" lang="">SEB Plugin</strong> is an extension to Moodle to facilitate the interaction between SEB and the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Quiz</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> activity.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">From a Moodle administrator’s point of view, you need to configure the following components to ensure SEB support <span class="No-Break" lang="">for quizzes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Safe Exam Browser templates</strong>: A SEB template<a id="_idIndexMarker931"/> is effectively a configuration file. The easiest way to create a SEB file is to create a quiz, configure the SEB settings manually, and download the configuration file. Then, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Quiz</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Safe Exam Browser templates</strong>, where you can create new<a id="_idIndexMarker932"/> templates (using the downloaded SEB file) and manage <span class="No-Break" lang="">existing ones:</span></li>

</ul>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">SEB requires students to download the browser on their computer or tablet. Doing a trial run with everybody’s equipment is recommended to avoid panic attacks minutes before an <span class="No-Break" lang="">important exam.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The third <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>popular assessment module in Moodle is the SCORM activity, which is the topic of the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsection.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-198" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Configuring SCORM</h2>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Shareable Content Object Reference Model</strong> (<strong class="bold" lang="">SCORM</strong>) is the de facto standard for <a id="_idIndexMarker936"/>exchanging learning objects across different learning management systems. Like assignments and quizzes, SCORM packages <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>are incorporated into courses via a dedicated activity. Unlike the other two assessment tools, the SCORM activity requires little<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> <span class="No-Break" lang="">administrative configuration.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">In <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Activity modules</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">SCORM package</strong>, there are two types <span class="No-Break" lang="">of parameters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Default settings</strong>: These have been grouped into three categories (display, grade, and others) and are described in detail <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/SCORM_settings"><span class="No-Break" lang="">docs.moodle.org/en/SCORM_settings</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Admin settings</strong>: The first four settings directly impact the features available to users and are all disabled by default. SCORM standards mode enforces strict compatibility with version 1.2, whereas the other three settings allow/disallow different <span class="No-Break" lang="">package types:</span></li>
</ul>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer260">

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.24 – SCORM configuration</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The <a id="_idIndexMarker939"/>remaining admin settings present internal data (sessions, timeout, user ID) or debugging features. Only adjust these settings if your users experience technical issues with their <span class="No-Break" lang="">SCORM packages.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This <a id="_idIndexMarker940"/>completes this section on configuring assignments, quizzes, and SCORMs. Other activities are classified as educational, such as Book, Database, Workshop, and Glossary, which haven’t been covered here. Almost all administrative settings are default values, appearance settings, or file upload limits. The tricky job of a Moodle administrator is to find a consensus among all their staff on what these parameters should be. We recommend leaving those activity-related settings at their default values unless specific requirements exist to <span class="No-Break" lang="">adjust them.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Closely related to assessments are skills and incentives, which we will deal with in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following section.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-199" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Managing skills and incentives</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Skills and<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> incentives are at the heart of each assessment strategy. Since Moodle is a strategic building block of a modern learning environment, we feel the two concepts deserve a <span class="No-Break" lang="">dedicated section.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">A <strong class="bold" lang="">skill</strong> is the ability to perform a particular action to solve a given problem. Skills are represented in Moodle <span class="No-Break" lang="">as competencies.</span></p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">An <strong class="bold" lang="">incentive</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker942"/>motivator to acquire a skill. Incentives are represented in Moodle as grades, feedback, badges, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and certificates.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">We will <a id="_idIndexMarker943"/>now focus <a id="_idIndexMarker944"/>on three skills and incentives tools being offered in Moodle, as depicted in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.25 – Moodle skills and incentives</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The left part of the diagram covers <strong class="bold" lang="">achievements</strong> in <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>the form of completions at different levels, such as activity and course (or program and certification in Moodle Workplace). Various components support a range of award mechanisms; for instance, attaching a <strong class="bold" lang="">Competency</strong> once a certain number of points have been achieved in a quiz, issuing a <strong class="bold" lang="">Badge</strong> when completing a course, or awarding a <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificate</strong> after completing <span class="No-Break" lang="">a program.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This section focuses on administrative tasks for the aforementioned components – competencies, badges, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and certificates.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-200" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>Managing competencies</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Competencies<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> describe <a id="_idIndexMarker947"/>the learner’s proficiency or level of understanding in specific subject-related skills. Moodle has powerful competency management that fully supports modeling and awarding competencies. The main components and issuing mechanisms of competencies are depicted in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer262">
<img alt="Figure 9.26 – Moodle competencies " height="544" src="image/Figure_9.26_B18779.jpg" width="1384"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.26 – Moodle competencies</p>
<p lang="en-GB">A <strong class="bold" lang="">competency</strong> has specific properties such as name, scale (for instance, not competent, competent with supervision, competent), the competency framework it belongs to, and a parent to model competency hierarchies. A competency is usually tied to course and/or activity completions. Competencies can be part of a <strong class="bold" lang="">Learning Plan</strong> (template) that’s assigned to users or cohorts. Moodle supports different awarding mechanisms, namely <strong class="bold" lang="">Automatic</strong> upon completion, following a <strong class="bold" lang="">review</strong> process after providing additional <strong class="bold" lang="">Evidence</strong>, or <strong class="bold" lang="">Manual</strong>. In Moodle Workplace, competencies can also be awarded via dynamic rules, where competencies can be configured via the <span class="No-Break" lang="">rule action.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Detailed information on <a id="_idIndexMarker948"/>competencies can be found at <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Competencies">docs.moodle.org/en/Competencies</a>. We will focus on the main mechanisms of how to model competencies and configure awarding mechanisms since this is done site-wide and thus requires <span class="No-Break" lang="">administrative permissions.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">We will <a id="_idIndexMarker949"/>use the <strong class="bold" lang="">Common European Framework of Reference for Languages</strong> (<strong class="bold" lang="">CEFR</strong>) as<a id="_idIndexMarker950"/> an exemplar competency framework since it is used across Europe and, increasingly, in other countries to measure a learner’s language skill sets. First, you need to create a competency framework at <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Competencies</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Competency frameworks</strong>, as shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following screenshot:</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">For simplicity, we have imported the <strong class="bold" lang="">CEFR</strong> framework from the public Moodle <strong class="bold" lang="">Competency frameworks repository</strong> (via the respective button at the top). The result of the framework and its competencies (<strong class="bold" lang="">A1</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">A2</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">B1</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">B2</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">C1</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">C2</strong>), along with its sub-competencies, is shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following screenshot:</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">Once <a id="_idIndexMarker951"/>competencies have been modeled in a competency framework, the next step is to configure how to award competencies to users once they are proficient in the skill to be acquired. There are two options regarding how to award a competency <span class="No-Break" lang="">to learners:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">Via <strong class="bold" lang="">course and activity completion</strong>, where proficiency is achieved by completing defined tasks. The most straightforward option is competency <strong class="bold" lang="">completion</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker952"/>concludes the user’s process of achieving the competency. Attaching <strong class="bold" lang="">evidence</strong> allows users to submit <a id="_idIndexMarker953"/>a testimony of training received outside of Moodle – for instance, a link to a public webinar or a certificate of participation in an external seminar. The last option is for the learner to request a <strong class="bold" lang="">review</strong> by <a id="_idIndexMarker954"/><span class="No-Break" lang="">the instructor.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">As an administrator, you do not need to configure course and activity completion since teachers or course authors do this. All that is required are the aforementioned competencies inside <span class="No-Break" lang="">competency frameworks.</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">Via <strong class="bold" lang="">learning plans</strong>, to ensure that groups of users achieve competency – for instance, all data protection officers. <strong class="bold" lang="">Learning plans</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker955"/>a means to ensure that all of your learners have targeted learning based on their goals and training needs and that it has been delivered in a structured way based on learning plan templates, which themselves are based on competencies. You can create learning<a id="_idIndexMarker956"/> plans based on the learning plan template, either manually for individual users or automatically <span class="No-Break" lang="">via cohorts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>

<p lang="en-GB">Once a learning plan template has been finalized, you can create individual learning plans one by one via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Create learning plans</strong> option in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Edit</strong> menu or automatically via <strong class="bold" lang="">Add cohorts to sync</strong>. Users can view their learning plans via the <strong class="bold" lang="">Learning plans</strong> link in their respective user profiles, where they also have the option to provide evidence of prior learning – for instance, documentation of <span class="No-Break" lang="">prior learning.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle Workplace <a id="_idIndexMarker957"/>supports a third option via dynamic rules to award competencies based on flexible criteria, such as cohort membership.

<p lang="en-GB">This concludes our quick run-down of Moodle’s robust and flexible implementation of competencies, which included modeling competency frameworks and configuring awarding mechanisms via activity and course completion, as well as via learning plans. Next up is the second incentive <span class="No-Break" lang="">type: badges.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-201" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Managing badges</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Badges <a id="_idIndexMarker958"/>are a good way of celebrating achievement and showing learning progress. Moodle allows you to manage badges and gives you different ways to award badges. Moodle badges are fully compatible with Open Badges and can be published in any Open <span class="No-Break" lang="">Badges-compatible backpack.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Badges <a id="_idIndexMarker959"/>are awarded based on various chosen criteria and will be displayed on a user’s profile. The main components and issuing mechanisms of badges are depicted in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer266">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.30 – Moodle badges</p>
<p lang="en-GB">A badge has <a id="_idIndexMarker960"/>specific properties such as name, expiry date, and issuer. Additionally, badges have one or many <strong class="bold" lang="">criteria</strong> to be fulfilled to trigger their award. Some criteria only exist at the <strong class="bold" lang="">course level</strong>, while others exist at the <strong class="bold" lang="">site level</strong>. The <strong class="bold" lang="">awarding</strong> itself is automatic, except for <span class="No-Break" lang="">manual assignment.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Detailed information on badges can be <a id="_idIndexMarker961"/>found at <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Badges">docs.moodle.org/en/Badges</a>. We will now focus on the main mechanisms of managing and <span class="No-Break" lang="">awarding badges.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Once you or some creative whiz kid in your marketing department has created the badges to be awarded to your learners, you will need to add and manage these in your learning management system. In Moodle, there are two types <span class="No-Break" lang="">of badges:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Course badges</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>assigned at the course level and are <a id="_idIndexMarker963"/>related to the activities and completions inside <span class="No-Break" lang="">a course</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Site badges</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>assigned site-wide and are related to achievements, such <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>as completing a set of courses in Moodle or a certification in <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle Workplace</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">As an administrator, you are only concerned about site badges, which are managed under <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Badges</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage Badges</strong>. Once you have added a badge and provided its properties, you must specify the <strong class="bold" lang="">badge criteria</strong>. There are different types<a id="_idIndexMarker966"/> of course badge criteria and site badge criteria, as shown in the following <span class="No-Break" lang="">screenshot comparison:</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.31 – Course badge criteria versus site badge criteria</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>following badge criteria <span class="No-Break" lang="">are available:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Course completion</strong> (course): The user has completed the <span class="No-Break" lang="">current course</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Awarded badges</strong> (both): The user has been awarded the <span class="No-Break" lang="">selected badge(s)</span></li>

<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Manual issue by role</strong> (site): To be awarded manually by users with a particular role within the site or <span class="No-Break" lang="">a course</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Completing set of courses</strong> (site): The user has completed the <span class="No-Break" lang="">selected course(s)</span></li>

<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Cohort membership</strong> (site): The user is a member of the <span class="No-Break" lang="">selected cohort(s)</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">As with competencies, there are two options regarding how to award a badge to <span class="No-Break" lang="">a learner:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Automatic</strong>: All <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>preceding criteria, except <strong class="bold" lang="">Manual issue by role</strong>, trigger awarding a badge to the users who have successfully fulfilled the <span class="No-Break" lang="">respective criteria</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Manual</strong>: When<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> the <strong class="bold" lang="">Manual issue by role</strong> criterion has been selected (site badges only), a user with the correct permissions can award a badge to <span class="No-Break" lang="">another user</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">In Moodle Workplace, badges can also be awarded via dynamic rules, where badges can be configured via the rule action. This awarding mechanism is described in detail <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Dynamic_rules"><span class="No-Break" lang="">docs.moodle.org/en/Dynamic_rules</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Users can view their awarded badges in the <strong class="bold" lang="">Badges</strong> section of their <span class="No-Break" lang="">user profile.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This completes<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> our brief introduction to badges, where we covered Moodle’s management and awarding mechanisms. Next up is the third and last incentive <span class="No-Break" lang="">type: certificates.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-202" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Managing certificates</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Certificates <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>are an excellent incentive for both formal and informal training. However, at the time of writing, they are not (yet?) part of Moodle, but they are of Moodle Workplace. However, the module works without a glitch in Moodle. We installed<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> the <strong class="bold" lang="">Workplace certificate manager</strong> in <a href="B18779_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor168"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Understanding Moodle Plugins</em>. Moodle HQ has developed the plugin, so it is safe to assume that it is here to stay. As always, we will concentrate on the administrative <a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>elements of the tool. You find the full documentation <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Certificates"><span class="No-Break" lang="">docs.moodle.org/en/Certificates</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The certificate<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> manager allows you to design engaging certificates and then award them to users in different ways. The tool comes with a certificate generator, which lets you design templates so that diplomas or certificates of participation can be issued. The basic workflow is shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following diagram:</span></p>

<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer268">

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.32 – Basic certificate workflow</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Certificate templates</strong> act <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>as a blueprint <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>and contain <strong class="bold" lang="">static elements</strong> (organization name or logo), <strong class="bold" lang="">dynamic elements</strong> (username or certification title), and <strong class="bold" lang="">verification elements</strong> (code or digital signature). Based <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>on the<a id="_idIndexMarker978"/> template, individual <strong class="bold" lang="">certificates</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker979"/> generated and assigned to <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>users, which can be done manually or via the course certificate activity. Moodle Workplace also supports certificate issuing via <span class="No-Break" lang="">dynamic rules.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">We will <a id="_idIndexMarker981"/>mainly deal with the basics of certificate template management as teachers or instructors usually trigger the awarding via the aforementioned course certificate activity. Most of this content has been borrowed from <a href="B18779_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Skills and Incentives</em> of <em class="italic" lang="">Corporate Learning with Moodle Workplace,</em> published by <span class="No-Break" lang="">Packt Publishing.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You can manage certificate templates via <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage certificate templates</strong>, where you will see a list of certificate templates. In our demo instance, we have already created three certificate templates. On the right of each item, you will see several actions, some of which are the usual Moodle icons (<strong class="bold" lang="">Edit</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Details</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Preview</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Duplicate</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">Delete</strong>), while others are specific to certificates (<strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates issued</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Issue certificates</strong>). We will discuss these in <span class="No-Break" lang="">due course:</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.33 – Certificate templates</p>
<p lang="en-GB">To create a new certificate template, select the <strong class="bold" lang="">+ New certificate template</strong> button; you will then <a id="_idIndexMarker982"/>be greeted with a pop-up screen and the following mostly <span class="No-Break" lang="">self-explanatory settings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Name</strong>: This doesn’t have to be unique, but it is recommended not to use the same name more <span class="No-Break" lang="">than once.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Course category</strong>: The certificate is available in the selected course category; it is also <strong class="bold" lang="">Available in sub-categories and courses</strong> if the option is enabled. When no course category is selected, the certificate is available across <span class="No-Break" lang="">the site.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Page width</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Page height</strong>: The default values depend on your server locale. For reference, the dimensions of A4 are 297 mm and 210 mm; the ones for letter size are 279 mm and 216 <span class="No-Break" lang="">mm, respectively.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Left margin</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Right margin</strong>: These are for the edge width on the left and right in mm. The default <span class="No-Break" lang="">is 0.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">As soon as<a id="_idIndexMarker983"/> you save the certificate template, you will be directed to the certificate designer, which we will work <span class="No-Break" lang="">with next.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Certificate designer</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">certificate designer</strong> lets<a id="_idIndexMarker984"/> you interactively create multi-page, multi-language certificate templates.

<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Page actions</strong>.

<p lang="en-GB">Once some <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>elements have been added to a template, each item will be listed on the left.

<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Tip</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">To modify the element values, simply click the element on <span class="No-Break" lang="">the canvas.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Now, let’s go through the different elements that can be added to a <span class="No-Break" lang="">certificate template.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Adding certificate elements</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">To add an <a id="_idIndexMarker987"/>element to the certificate template, select it from the <strong class="bold" lang="">Add element</strong> drop-down, which opens up a pop-up menu containing element options. Each element contains the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following settings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Element name</strong>: This identifies an element when editing a certificate. Note that this will not be displayed on <span class="No-Break" lang="">the certificate.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Element-specific settings</strong>: These, mostly self-explanatory options, depend on the added element type. For example, a text string has a font and size, whereas the date field also has <span class="No-Break" lang="">a format.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Element dimension(s)</strong>: Every element has a <strong class="bold" lang="">Width</strong>, while some elements (for example, images) also have <span class="No-Break" lang="">a </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Height</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Element position</strong>: When you select <strong class="bold" lang="">Show more…</strong>, two more settings – <strong class="bold" lang="">Position X</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Position Y</strong> – will be shown, with the apex at the top left of the certificate template. Usually, you position your image by dragging and dropping it onto the canvas; however, sometimes, it is useful to position elements manually, especially when you need to align multiple items horizontally <span class="No-Break" lang="">or vertically.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">We have <a id="_idIndexMarker988"/>grouped the available element-specific certificate settings into three categories – static, dynamic, and validation – which<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> will be covered in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following subsections.</span></p>
<h4 lang="en-GB">Adding static certificate elements</h4>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Static elements</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker990"/> fixed for <a id="_idIndexMarker991"/>every certificate issued from the certificate template, and they will be identical on every certificate that will be generated. The<a id="_idIndexMarker992"/> three static elements that are available are <strong class="bold" lang="">Border</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Image</strong>, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Text</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">certificate border</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker993"/>only element that cannot be moved around on <span class="No-Break" lang="">the canvas.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">You will need to <a id="_idIndexMarker994"/>upload a <strong class="bold" lang="">certificate image</strong> that has been prepared elsewhere. The supported image file types are GIF, JPE, JPG, JPEG, PNG, SVG, and SVGZ. Alternatively, you can select a <strong class="bold" lang="">shared image</strong>, which is managed centrally and acts as a simple repository for assets used on multiple certificates; for instance, your company logo or the signatures of certificate signees. You can manage shared images by going to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificate images</strong>. If you tick the <strong class="bold" lang="">Use as a background image</strong> box, the picture will be stretched across the entire certificate and shown behind all other elements. It is recommended that you use an image with added transparency when it is used as <span class="No-Break" lang="">a background.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Certificate text</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker995"/>effectively a label for which you can specify <strong class="bold" lang="">Font</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Size</strong> (in <strong class="bold" lang="">pt</strong>), and <strong class="bold" lang="">Colour</strong>. You also have three <strong class="bold" lang="">Text alignment</strong> options: <strong class="bold" lang="">Left</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Centre</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">Right</strong>. Right alignment of the text means that the element coordinates’ <strong class="bold" lang="">Position X</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Position Y</strong> will refer to the top-right corner of the text box; in center alignment, they will refer to the top middle, and in left alignment, they will refer to the <span class="No-Break" lang="">top-left corner:</span></li>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.35 – Certificate text element</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Text supports <a id="_idIndexMarker996"/>multi-lingual content to generate certificates in the user’s language via so-called lang tags. Ensure the <strong class="bold" lang="">Issue certificate in user language</strong> setting in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates settings</strong> is ticked, the multi-language content filter is enabled, and text fields contain multi-language tags.

<p lang="en-GB">Now that we have added all the required static elements, namely <strong class="bold" lang="">Border</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Image</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">Text</strong>, let’s look at the different dynamic elements that can be placed on a <span class="No-Break" lang="">certificate template.</span></p>
<h4 lang="en-GB">Adding dynamic certificate elements</h4>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Dynamic elements</strong> will <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>be replaced<a id="_idIndexMarker998"/> with specific data for every certificate issued from the certificate template. Thus, each dynamic element acts as a mini placeholder <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>on the certificate template. Typical dynamic values include the receiver’s name, the course title, or simply the date when the certificate will be issued. The four dynamic elements available are <strong class="bold" lang="">Date</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Dynamic fields</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">User field</strong>, and <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">User picture</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">certificate Date</strong> element <a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/>adds a date field to the template, either <strong class="bold" lang="">Issued date</strong> (when the PDF will be generated) or <strong class="bold" lang="">Expiry date</strong> (when the certificate’s validity ends). You can further choose from one of the seven available <strong class="bold" lang="">Date format</strong> options. Please note that the <strong class="bold" lang="">Date format</strong> options will be adjusted according to the active language pack while editing the certificate template. While there is no limit to the number of date elements you can put on a certificate template, usually, one item is placed on <span class="No-Break" lang="">the document.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">certificate Dynamic fields</strong> element<a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/> type is effectively a placeholder for several course fields: short name, full name, URL, completion grade, and, if present, custom course fields. In our example, we have selected the course’s full name, which will be displayed on the PDF once generated. In Moodle Workplace, additional program and certification fields are at <span class="No-Break" lang="">your disposal.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">certificate User field</strong> displays<a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/> textual information on the certificate, which supports all plain text fields (that is, no rich text/HTML text fields) in the user profile, including custom profile fields. We have added the user’s full name on our certificate, which is almost always part of a <span class="No-Break" lang="">personalized certificate.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">The <strong class="bold" lang="">certificate User picture</strong> type <a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/>adds the user’s image to the template. User pictures are handled the same way as elements of the <strong class="bold" lang="">Image</strong> type; the only difference is that the picture cannot be selected since it is already set in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">user profile.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">This concludes this subsection on dynamic certificate elements, where we covered <strong class="bold" lang="">Date</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Dynamic fields</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">User field</strong>, and <strong class="bold" lang="">User picture</strong>. Next up are <span class="No-Break" lang="">validation elements.</span></p>
<h4 lang="en-GB">Adding validation certificate elements</h4>
<p lang="en-GB">Certificates<a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/> are regularly <a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/>issued in settings where their validity is critical; for example, diplomas, compliance documents, and qualification credentials. To ensure that the certificates have been<a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/> generated by the Moodle system, two validation mechanisms <span class="No-Break" lang="">are offered:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Certificate code</strong>: Every<a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/> issued certificate contains a unique <strong class="bold" lang="">code</strong>, made up of 10 digits plus two uppercase letters; for instance, 0123456789AB (The last two letters are the user’s initials). This code can be displayed on the certificate in four different formats: <strong class="bold" lang="">Code only</strong> (default), <strong class="bold" lang="">Code with link</strong>, <strong class="bold" lang="">Verification URL</strong> (code without a link), and <strong class="bold" lang="">QR Code</strong> (as used in <span class="No-Break" lang="">our example).</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">To verify the certificate’s validity (code), Moodle offers a dedicated form that can be reached via one of the four described display options. It is also possible to enter codes manually via <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Verify certificates</strong>, as shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following screenshot:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer272">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.36 – Certificate validation</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Once <a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/>you select <strong class="bold" lang="">Verify</strong>, information regarding the certificate metadata is displayed. You can also access the document’s PDF version by selecting the <strong class="bold" lang="">View certificate</strong> link at <span class="No-Break" lang="">the bottom.</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Digital signatures</strong> can<a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/> be added to a certificate (template) based on self-signed CRT certificates that follow the X.509 standard. They offer a higher degree of security than the code element by electronically signing the generated PDF file with a self-signed certificate to prevent forgery and falsification <span class="No-Break" lang="">of certificates.</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">It is<a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/> common to sign an image in a document using a logo, a signature, or a seal, although creating signed PDFs with no in-document visualization is possible. The only compulsory field is the digital signature itself, represented as a CRT file. You will either have to use an existing CRT file from your organization or generate a self-signed certificate. Follow these three steps via the Linux <span class="No-Break" lang="">command line:</span></p>
<p class="source-code" lang="en-GB">openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365000 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout moodle.crt -out moodle.crt</p>
<p class="source-code" lang="en-GB">openssl pkcs12 -export -in moodle.crt -out moodle.p12</p>
<p class="source-code" lang="en-GB">openssl pkcs12 -in moodle.p12 -out moodle.crt -nodes</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>first command creates a <a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/>self-signed signature that’s valid for 10 years (365,000 days) and is RSA-encrypted with 1,024 bytes. It contains both the private key and the certificate part. The second step is to export the CRT file in P12 format before converting it into a PEM file. You will need to provide the CRT file – here, <strong class="source-inline" lang="">moodle.crt</strong> – to the digital signature on your certificate, which uses the standard key part to tag the certificate as valid and verifiable. Internally, the PDF generator uses functionality in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">TCPDF library.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">With that, we have listed the supported certificate elements, all of which have been utilized in our sample certificate, as shown in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer273">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.37 – Certificate elements</p>
<p lang="en-GB">By default, all available certificate plugins are shown in alphabetical order in the certificate designer menu. If you wish to change the order of the elements or hide any elements that are not in use in your organization, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Admin tools</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Manage certificate element plugins</strong> and configure the list as required. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/>also possible for developers to create new certificate element plugins, which <a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/>will appear in this list and be treated like <span class="No-Break" lang="">core elements.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Now that we have dealt with creating certificate templates, let’s look at administrative tasks for <span class="No-Break" lang="">certificate issuing.</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Issuing certificates</h3>
<p lang="en-GB">The key objective<a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/> of certificates is to be awarded to users once they have completed a specific task or solved a given problem. Certificates can either be issued manually or via the course <span class="No-Break" lang="">certificate activity.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">To <strong class="bold" lang="">manually issue a certificate</strong>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/>have to select the <strong class="bold" lang="">Issue certificates from this template</strong> icon to the right of the certificate template. This will open a pop-up form where you have to choose at least one user and, optionally, specify an expiry date or period. In the following screenshot, two users have <span class="No-Break" lang="">been selected:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer274">
<img alt="Figure 9.38 – Manually issuing certificates " height="647" src="image/Figure_9.38_B18779.jpg" width="1156"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.38 – Manually issuing certificates</p>
<p lang="en-GB">For every<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> issued certificate, no matter how it has been generated, metadata will be stored in the underlying Moodle database. Select the <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates issued</strong> icon beside the certificate template to view this data. In addition to self-explanatory standard fields, the table shows the certificate code and a link to the verification page. In the <strong class="bold" lang="">Actions</strong> column, a <strong class="bold" lang="">Preview</strong> of the generated PDF file can be viewed, the PDF file can be regenerated on the fly and re-issued to the user (the award date and time remain unchanged), and the certificate can <span class="No-Break" lang="">be revoked.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">To use <a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/>the <strong class="bold" lang="">Course Certificate activity</strong>, you must install <strong class="bold" lang="">mod_coursecertificate</strong> from <a href="http://moodle.org/plugins/mod_coursecertificate">moodle.org/plugins/mod_coursecertificate</a>. This activity allows teachers to choose from certificate templates. Learners will then be able to download a PDF copy of the certificate themselves, and there are options to email PDF copies automatically. As all this takes place at the course level, you, as the administrator, don’t have to worry about this. More details on this activity can be found <span class="No-Break" lang="">at </span><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_certificate_activity"><span class="No-Break" lang="">docs.moodle.org/en/Course_certificate_activity</span></a><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">One last certificate-related admin setting might be relevant: users can see their certificates on the <strong class="bold" lang="">My certificates</strong> page in their user profile. If the <strong class="bold" lang="">Show share on LinkedIn</strong> option is ticked in <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">General</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Certificates settings</strong>, an additional column labeled <strong class="bold" lang="">Share on LinkedIn</strong> will be shown. When users select the LinkedIn icon, the certificate will be added to their feed. You need to<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> follow the instructions shown to receive your <strong class="bold" lang="">LinkedIn organization ID</strong> for this <span class="No-Break" lang="">to work.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This completes our look at the trio of skills and incentives covered in this chapter, where we covered competency management, badge configuration, and creating and <span class="No-Break" lang="">issuing certificates.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-203" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>Summary</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">This chapter taught you how to administer any Moodle tools and features classified <span class="No-Break" lang="">as educational.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">First, we configured collaboration tools while covering blogs, comments, and tags. Next, we dealt with various content creation features and looked at the Moodle content bank and H5P, LTI platforms and tools, filters, plagiarism prevention, and licenses. We then configured grades and assessments, namely the gradebook and the configuration of the three activity types – assignment, quiz, and SCORM. Finally, we managed skills and incentives in the form of competencies and learning plans, badges, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and certificates.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You should now be in a good position to approach all organizational stakeholders to gather relevant input to ensure a suitable setup of <span class="No-Break" lang="">educational components.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Due to the high volume of configuration areas, we have divided the configuration topic into two separate chapters – educational configuration, which we dealt with in this chapter, and technical configuration, which we will cover in the <span class="No-Break" lang="">next chapter.</span></p>
