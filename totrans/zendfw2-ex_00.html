This version has considerably eased the process of building complex web applications with minimal development effort using plug and play components. Zend Framework 2 also provides a highly robust and scalable framework for developing web applications.</p><p>This book will guide you through the process of developing powerful web applications using ZF2. It covers all aspects of Zend Framework application development right from installation and configuration; the tasks are designed in a way that readers can easily understand and use them to build their own applications with ease.</p><p>This book begins with basic installation and configuration of the Zend Framework. As you progress through the exercises, you will become thoroughly acquainted with ZF2. With this book, you will learn about the basic concepts of building solid MVC web applications using Zend Framework 2. The detailed step-by-step instructions will enable you to build functionality such as a group chat, a file and media sharing service, search, and a simple store, to name a few. You will also use a wide range of external modules to implement features that are not natively available.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be well versed in building complex and functionality-rich web applications using Zend Framework 2.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
