                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As you have seen while reading this book, WordPress comes fully equipped to power a blog, with all of the particular requirements of post handling, categorization, chronological display, and so on, that come with a blog. However, powering blogs is not WordPress' only purpose. Not anymore. In fact, there are millions of websites out there right now that run WordPress, but where blogging is not the primary focus of the website. I myself have built a number of such sites.</p>
<p>Just to give you a general idea of what's possible, the following is a list of some popular non-blog type websites that you can build and launch using WordPress (we will cover some of them in more detail later in this and the next chapter):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static websites</strong>: These feature just a handful of static subpages that are not meant to be updated very often; also, the main content is not organized chronologically like blog posts.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate or business websites</strong>: These are similar to the previous type, but usually a bit bigger in size and in the number of subpages; additionally, for most business sites, their design appears very official and toned down.</li>
<li><strong>One-page websites</strong>: These are websites that only have a single page of content; used mostly as a business card-type site, or used by businesses that don't have a lot of content to showcase on their site. Even though the whole site is comprised of just a page, the designs are usually attractive, with a lot of dynamic transition effects and parallax scrolling backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce stores</strong>: These are websites where anyone can browse through a number of products and then use a shopping cart to make a purchase. Apart from the shopping cart functionality, there's also online payment integration and often a backend inventory management system.</li>
<li><strong>Membership websites</strong>: A type of site where some of the content is available only to those users who have signed up for a membership and (often) paid a small fee for the privilege; such members-only areas can contain any type of content that the site owner finds suitable<span>—</span>WordPress doesn't limit this in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Video blogs</strong>: This is just like a standard blog, only instead of text-based posts, the blogger publishes video posts.</li>
<li><strong>Photo blogs</strong>: These are just like video blogs, only revolving around photos; they are a very common type of blog for photographers, graphic designers, and other people of similar professions.</li>
<li><strong>Product websites</strong>: In short, it's a type of site very similar to an e-commerce store, only this time, we're usually dealing with just a single product on sale. It's a very popular type of website for all kinds of web, iOS, Android apps.</li>
<li><strong>Social networks</strong>: Just like Facebook, only these are run on WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>Niche business websites</strong>: Some examples of such sites are local restaurant websites, hotel websites, coffee shop websites, personal portfolio websites, art gallery websites, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if I were to explain, in brief, what a general non-blog website is, I'd say that it's any kind of website where the blog is not the main functionality used by the website owner. And of course, non-blog websites make up the majority of the internet as a whole. However, since we're discussing WordPress here, which many still believe to be a blog system only, I just want to assure you that this is no longer the case. These days, WordPress can be used for virtually anything.</p>
<p>In this chapter and the next, we will go through some of the types of websites we have just mentioned and present an effective way of building them with WordPress. We'll also use the knowledge that we've acquired in the previous chapters, so it's best that you get familiar with everything that's been going on so far, before consuming the information in the following pages.</p>
<p>Here are the types of websites that we're going to cover in depth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites</li>
<li>Corporate or business websites</li>
<li>One-page websites</li>
<li>E-commerce stores</li>
<li>Video blogs and photo blogs</li>
<li>Social networks</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Also, there are a number of new pieces of functionality that we have not explored in the previous chapters, and this is what we will be focusing on. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a custom post type with a custom taxonomy</li>
<li>Altering the custom post type display in <kbd>wp-admin</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's get started!</p>

<p>Even though there are many different types of sites that one can build with WordPress, there are some steps that are mandatory for all of them.</p>
<p>For instance, no matter what type of website you want to launch, you always have to start by installing WordPress properly. This is exactly what we talked about in <a href="2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Getting Started with WordPress</em>. Virtually, nothing is different at this point. The installation process is the same, all of the steps are the same, and the final result is the same too<span>—</span>you end up with a clean, blank WordPress installation. Also, whenever installing specific themes and plugins, make sure to follow the same guidelines that we discussed in <a href="1f05677b-dcae-4511-9add-b4cf68718507.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Plugins – What They Are and Why You Need Them,</em> and <a href="ffd72a00-558a-4dfc-a5c2-83f6051196a7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Choosing and Installing Themes</em>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, to ensure that your site is secure and has a good user management structure, you have to keep in mind all of the best practices revolving around user accounts and editorial workflow (publishing new content).</p>
<p>Basically, the only element that's different when building a non-blog website is the process of picking the theme and selecting the plugins for the site. Additionally, if you want to take it to the next level, you'll have to look into implementing various functionalities by hand, or getting a custom solution made for you by a professional.</p>
<p>Luckily though, the process itself is not much more difficult than working with a standard blog. So, once you have some experience with WordPress under your belt, you'll be able to get it done just as quickly.</p>

<p>Let's start with static websites, as they are the simplest type of non-blog websites, and also the easiest ones to create (which shouldn't be surprising).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The best part about static websites is that building them doesn't require any specific themes or plugins. The secret is your mindset as the developer. In essence, to pull this off effectively, the only things you need to do are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilize the page's functionality in WordPress</li>
<li>Tune up the default home page to create a more static experience</li>
</ol>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">The process</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Firstly, let's tackle one common misconception. The point of a static website isn't to make the content hard coded into the HTML or PHP files at all. The actual point is to abandon the standard chronological organization of content (to abandon the blog functionality) and to focus on building a site where pages exist on their own, independently of one another. So, in the end, we can still edit everything pretty easily through <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, and the only difference is that we're not using the standard WordPress posts for anything. Instead, we're focusing on the WordPress pages.</p>
<p>During the setup process of a good static page, you'll have to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a WordPress theme that fits your goals and looks attractive for your particular project (something we talked about in <a href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/wordpress_complete___7th_edition/wp-admin/post.php?post=35&amp;action=edit#post_30" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a><span>,</span><em> Choosing and Installing Themes</em>); this is a mandatory step for all types of non-blog websites. Quite simply, not every theme will fit every type of website. So, whenever picking a specific one, keep in mind what you want to use the website for—this is going to make your work easier as a developer and make the website better for future visitors once the site is launched.</li>
<li>Create a list of all of the static pages that you want to make a part of your website. For instance, for a local pet grooming service, the pages could be a gallery, offers and pricing, testimonials, a contact page, and a map.</li>
<li>Create each page in the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> (through <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>).</li>
<li>Create one more page, call it <span class="packt_screen">HOME</span>, and tweak it to provide a good home page experience. For instance, start by focusing on the elements that a first-time visitor would consider useful on your home page. A good home page should answer the question, <em>what is this site about?</em></li>
<li>Create easy-to-grasp menus to make navigation a breeze.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 1 to 3 are pretty straightforward, so let's just focus on the last two.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Building your home page</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>By default, WordPress takes the main blog listing (the chronological list of posts) and uses it as the home page. This is not the desired situation in our case, since there will be no posts. What we'll do instead is create a custom page and then use it as a static front page (home page).</p>
<p>We talked about how to do this in detail back in <a href="74cf5381-e680-4dc0-8de9-7d95b3e08b69.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Pages, Media, and Importing/Exporting Content</em>. Therefore, let's just focus on a basic overview here, but feel free to go back to <a href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/wordpress_complete___7th_edition/wp-admin/post.php?post=35&amp;action=edit#post_27" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a><span>,</span><em><span> </span>Pages, Media, and Importing/Exporting Content,</em> for a more hands-on tutorial.</p>
<p>To build a new home page, go to <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> and proceed as if you were working on any other page. You can call it <span class="packt_screen">HOME</span> to make it clear what it is for. What you place on this page is up to you. Essentially, a home page should be a great starting page for anyone who visits a given site for the first time. For instance, you can go with a short introductory message, a list of some popular articles on your site, a contact form provided by the <span class="packt_screen">Contact Form 7</span> plugin, and an interactive map by <em>Google Maps</em>. You can place all of those elements using the new block-editor that's in WordPress.</p>
<p>Once you have your page ready, the only thing you have to do is assign it as the <em>front page</em>. This can be done in <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Reading</span>, as discussed in <a href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/wordpress_complete___7th_edition/wp-admin/post.php?post=35&amp;action=edit#post_27" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a><span>,</span><em><span> </span>Pages, Media, and Importing/Exporting Content</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to make your home page more fancy, you can create a custom page template (described in <a href="eb8f8110-a317-4b1f-afd4-b2bf72714b39.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Developing Your Own Theme</em>), which will allow you to include any design elements you might need, along with a wealth of custom functionality. Again, it all depends on the project.</p>

<p>The last element of this static-website puzzle is a proper menu (or menus). Because our home page is just like any other page that you can create in WordPress, it will appear in the default pages menu (pages widget), which isn't the most optimized situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever working with static websites, make sure to use only custom menus created in <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Menus</span>. This gives you full control over what gets displayed in the header, the sidebar, and anywhere else on the site.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Corporate or business websites</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When we look at the main purpose of corporate or business websites, it becomes apparent that their construction is very similar to static websites. The only difference is that they are much bigger (with more pages and more content), and their design seems much more official. Also, most businesses like to publish some occasional announcements, so a blog-like functionality is required too (but it still won't be the main element on the site).</p>
<p>In essence, creating a quality corporate site with WordPress is all about picking (or building) the right theme. If you do a quick bit of research on the web, you'll see that most corporate sites (at least the good ones) feature hardly any design. The thing that makes them stand out is their very subtle branding (through a certain color scheme or clever use of logos), and stellar navigation layout.</p>
<p>What this means is that the easiest way to build a great corporate site with WordPress is to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a clean theme with good content organization and featuring almost none of the design bells and whistles</li>
<li>Include specific branding elements and pick the right color scheme</li>
<li>Build a nice user-friendly navigation structure through custom menus</li>
<li>Construct a custom home page</li>
<li>Add one visual element in the form of a home page slider to make the site seem more alive (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's go through this list one by one.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Picking a clean theme</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is something we talked about in the previous chapters, so let me just point you toward some of the top places where you can get WordPress themes real quick. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The official directory (<a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a>)</li>
<li>ThemeIsle (<a href="https://themeisle.com/">https://themeisle.com/</a>)</li>
<li>Elegant Themes (<a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/">https://www.elegantthemes.com/</a>)</li>
<li>ThemeForest (<a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress">https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The thing to keep in mind is to go straight to the business-related part of the theme directory you're browsing. For example, at ThemeForest, go straight to <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress/corporate">https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress/corporate</a>. This will make the selection process a lot quicker.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Keep in mind that if it's a free theme you're after, you should always get it from the official directory (we discussed this in <a href="ffd72a00-558a-4dfc-a5c2-83f6051196a7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Choosing and Installing Themes</em>).</div>
<p>The features to look for in a quality corporate theme include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimal design that lets you include branding elements</li>
<li>An easy way of adding a logo and other graphics</li>
<li>Custom header functionality</li>
<li>Favicon support</li>
<li>A responsive layout (meaning that it'll be equally as attractive on a desktop computer as on a mobile phone)</li>
<li>Customizable sidebars</li>
<li>Customizable layouts (for example, full-width, 1-sidebar, 2-sidebar, and so on)</li>
<li>Multi-author support (there's usually a number of people taking care of a corporate site simultaneously)</li>
<li>Built-in color schemes to choose from</li>
<li>Be SEO-ready</li>
<li>Custom page templates for the home page, contact page, FAQ, offers, gallery, team, testimonials, 404 errors, portfolio, and so on</li>
<li>Be cross-browser compatible</li>
</ul>
<p>Your theme doesn't have to do all of these things, but this list should be a good benchmark in determining how suitable the theme you're about to pick is when it comes to running a corporate site.</p>


            </article>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Branding elements</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>From a business point of view, branding is the most important parameter of a recognizable site. Therefore, make sure that both the logo and the corporate identity of the company match the color scheme of the theme. Also, as I mentioned in the previous section, a good theme should allow you to pick the color scheme from one of the predefined ones.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Finally, turn the logo into a favicon and upload it to the site too (this can be done through your theme's built-in favicon functionality, or via a plugin, such as <span class="packt_screen">All In One Favicon</span>, available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-favicon/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-favicon/</a>). This will give the site some additional visibility in the bookmarks menu (should the visitor choose to bookmark it).</p>

        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Good navigation</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is probably the toughest part of the job when building a corporate site, mainly because we can never be sure how much content the site is eventually going to feature. There's always the danger that our navigation will either be too much for a handful of pages of content or too little for hundreds of pages. There are, however, some good practices that you can follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on providing an extensive menu in the footer. This will make sure that every visitor will be able to find what they're looking for once they scroll down to the bottom of the page. This is easily doable with footer widget areas, which every good corporate theme should provide you with. The following screenshot shows an example by Samsung:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cfb59694-d34b-4130-95f5-eefe04baedc6.png" width="1000" height="401"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a top menu with only a couple of the most essential pages. Sometimes, just four links will be enough. For example, the following screenshot demonstrates how Home Chef does this:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/09215f45-b429-469c-965b-f0d2c40317aa.png" style="width:30.50em;height:14.00em;" width="1109" height="510"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a sidebar menu linking to the important areas of the site, such as specific categories, products, announcements, or other things the average visitor might find interesting.</li>
<li>Use breadcrumbs: Breadcrumbs are small links that present the path of the visitor in relation to the home page. Most themes provide this functionality by default. It's best to place them just below the header. That way, the reader can easily go back to a more general page. An example of this is highlighted in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/995ae22c-a602-4f20-ba51-dd311316e7cd.png" style="width:31.75em;height:15.17em;" width="561" height="268"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Display a visible search field. A large number of visitors coming to a corporate site are after a specific piece of information, so they naturally start looking for a search field right away. Making their life easier is a very good idea. A great placement for a search field is in the header and in the main sidebar (sidebar menu) for good visibility.</li>
</ul>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Custom home page</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Just as with static websites, the default blog listing rarely makes a good home page for a corporate site. Going with a custom home page is always a better strategy, and gives us a more optimized way of presenting the company, its goals, and its field of expertise. To create such a home page, you can safely follow the instructions given earlier in this chapter, when we were discussing static websites.</p>
<p>Now, like I said, showing the default blog listing as the home page is not a good approach here. However, we should still provide at least some integration with the blog part of the website. The two most sensible solutions are to either link to the blog listing page in a visible place on the home page, or include a simplified listing as a widget in one of the available widget areas on the home page itself.</p>
<p>The latter can be done by the <span class="packt_screen">Recent Posts</span> widget that's available in WordPress by default (we covered widgets and how to use them in <a href="1f05677b-dcae-4511-9add-b4cf68718507.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Plugins – What They Are and Why You Need Them</em>). The former can be done as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new page (<span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>) and call it <span class="packt_screen">NEWS</span>. The page doesn't have to feature any content. It only needs to exist with a unique name. I'm suggesting <span class="packt_screen">NEWS</span> because it gives a clear indication of what's going on.</li>
<li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Reading</span> and set your new page as the default <span class="packt_screen">Posts page</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c43028e0-0afd-4068-a2a4-7c0aa7326188.png" style="width:31.75em;height:15.92em;" width="560" height="281"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>As you can see, there's also the old <span class="packt_screen">HOME</span> page that's currently set as the <span class="packt_screen">Front page</span>; we're going to leave it like that.</li>
</ol>

<li>Place the link to the new blog section (<span class="packt_screen">NEWS</span>) in the top menu (preferably). You can do it in <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Menus</span>.</li>
<li>Now, if you navigate to your new <span class="packt_screen">NEWS</span> page (using something like <kbd>http://yoursite.com/news</kbd>), you will see the default blog listing, which the company (or the owner of the website) can use to publish various announcements, or whatever else they see fit.</li>

<p>The last element worth discussing here is a home page slider. Although most corporate websites are not about the graphics, this single visual element is often added. Animated sliders make any website seem more alive and attractive to the visitor. For a corporate site, the slider can present photos from events, individual announcements, product offers, or contact details, as well as a number of other things.</p>
<p>Some themes will come with a slider functionality built-in right from the get-go. If they don't, you can always get a plugin to handle the job. The only downside is that most slider plugins are not free. Among those that are free, I can point out these two, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master Slider</strong>: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/master-slider/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/master-slider/</a></li>
<li><strong>Nivo Slider</strong>: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/nivo-slider-lite/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/nivo-slider-lite/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, sliders are not a mandatory thing for corporate websites, but they might improve user experience, so they're probably worth a try.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">One-page websites</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One-page websites are a relatively new invention in the online world. A couple of years ago, webmasters were not that keen on having just a single page to make up their entire website. It simply seemed like not working hard enough on your website's presence. These days, however, things have changed. It's no longer looked down on. In fact, single-page websites are the new trend.</p>
<p>In some way, a one-page or a single-page website is similar to a static website. You mostly get to work with WordPress pages rather than its blog functionality, and after you set that page in place, it will likely stay that way for a longer period of time—that is, it will remain static. On one-page websites, though, you simply get to work with only one page as opposed to having a number of them.</p>
<p>Just to give you a general overview of what a one-page site looks like, visit <a href="http://karol.cc/">http://karol.cc/</a>. It's my personal website, which I use to market my freelance writing services, and can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b7b4c314-3e67-4216-94f7-e301932af23c.png" style="width:35.50em;height:51.17em;" width="1000" height="1441"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As you can see, the website is built up of just a single page<span>—</span>the home page. However, each block on this page is visually separated from the previous and the next one. This visual separation is one of the most important aspects of single-page websites. So, as with many types of websites, creating a truly great-looking one-page site is about picking the right theme<span>—</span>something that your target audience will enjoy and appreciate. The easiest way to build a great one-page site with WordPress is to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a theme that's marketed explicitly as a one-page theme and has a clean design, with good-looking content blocks on the main page</li>
<li>Include specific branding elements and pick the right color scheme</li>
<li>Make sure to prepare a number of high-quality images that you can use in the background</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's go through this list one by one.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Picking a one-page theme</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Just as with most other categories, one-page themes are now highly popular in theme stores across the web. The best places to go find them include, again, the official directory (<a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a>), ThemeIsle (<a href="https://themeisle.com/">https://themeisle.com/</a>), and ThemeForest (<a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress">https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress</a>). Not all of them, however, feature specialized categories for one-page themes, so you might have to use the search option to find something interesting. Searching for terms such as <em>single page</em> or <em>one page</em> should give you great results.</p>
<p>The features to look for in a quality one-page theme are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimal design that lets you include your branding elements</li>
<li>An easy way of adding a logo and other graphics</li>
<li>Custom header functionality</li>
<li>A parallax scrolling option (where the background images appear to move more slowly than the foreground)</li>
<li>A responsive layout (meaning that it'll be equally as attractive on a desktop computer as on a mobile phone)</li>
<li>Built-in color schemes to choose from</li>
<li>Be SEO-ready</li>
<li>Be cross-browser compatible</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The more of these preceding features that your theme includes, the better. If anything is missing, you can always find a plugin that will fill the void. After all, there's a plugin for everything, remember?</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Branding elements</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Branding elements are particularly important with one-page sites because, by definition, you don't get much online real estate to work with, so to speak. If there's just one page on the site, you need to make sure that it's as in tune with your brand and identity as possible. Therefore, a good theme should allow you to place elements, such as your own logo, social media links, and custom graphics, in places such as the header, footer, and the background. Luckily, those sorts of features are considered the standard among modern WordPress themes, so you probably won't have to worry about this part at all.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">High-quality images</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One of the main flaws with one-page themes is that they often rely heavily on good visuals and high-quality images. The designs are often simple and very minimalist, and their attractive appearance is based on the images used in the background of the site. Unfortunately, finding such images is entirely up to you. Themes rarely come with unique images that you will be able to use on your site.</p>
<p>How to get those images? You can buy them in places such as <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/">https://www.istockphoto.com/</a>, that's one solution. But you can also get a lot of great images for free in places such as <a href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a>. The last solution is, of course, to take your own photos and use them on your site.</p>
<p>As an example, I will get one of the most popular one-page themes in the WordPress directory right now<span>—</span><strong>Hestia</strong> (available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/">https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/</a>), and do some basic tuning up around it to show you how one-page themes work.</p>
<p>Right after downloading and activating the theme (this is the standard procedure; see <a href="ffd72a00-558a-4dfc-a5c2-83f6051196a7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Choosing and Installing Themes,</em> for the how-to), you can go straight to WordPress Customizer at <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Customize</span>. You'll see a large customization panel there. With it, I can change the main headline on the site, the buttons, the appearance of individual blocks, and also the background image of the whole site, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/39668197-abfc-45b0-80b6-bec6ff814c18.png" width="935" height="307"/></p>
<p>After a handful of tweaks, I end up with a great-looking one-page site. You can see what my final header looks like in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ebe52f3e-59fa-4da3-a632-1b8ec61c78cd.png" width="976" height="492"/></p>
<p>That's pretty much it when it comes to launching a nice one-page website with WordPress. The most remarkable thing here is how easy it is to actually do this. Just imagine how much time it would take to create something like this from the ground up, or the cost required to set it up. The possibilities that WordPress delivers these days are really incredible.</p>

<p>We covered a lot of excellent material in this chapter. We started by listing some of the popular types of non-blog websites that you can build successfully with WordPress. Then, we went through some of those websites individually and discussed the specific elements to focus on, in order to guarantee a quality final product.</p>
<p>The next chapter is part two of our guide to creating a non-blog website. In it, we'll go through some of the more user-centered types of websites, such as e-commerce stores, photo and video blogs, and finally, building your own social network.</p>
