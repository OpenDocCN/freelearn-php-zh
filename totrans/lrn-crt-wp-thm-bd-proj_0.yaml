    to finish. We will look at all the fundamental concepts that are needed to start
    building great themes.

- en: To get through the book, you should have some experience in HTML/CSS and PHP.
    You will also need to have a general idea of what WordPress is—it's installation
    and WordPress website management—and a basic understanding of some programming
    fundamentals, for example, arrays, variables, loops, statements, and so on. The
    projects are mainly based around HTML5, CSS3, and PHP.

- en: Apart from these, there are some other technologies and concepts that we will
    be looking at throughout the book. These include WordPress post loops, which is
    the main loop that grabs database to WordPress, hooks/actions, the `functions.php`
    file where we put our dynamic code for our WordPress theme, widgets, WP_queries,
    and theme customizer. Also, we'll be using a range of frameworks such as Bootstrap,
    Foundation, and W3 CSS, which is a fairly new framework.
