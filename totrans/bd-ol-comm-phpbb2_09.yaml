- en: A full download of phpBB 2.0 contains about three hundred files sorted into
    twenty-one directories. In order to do certain types of more advanced work with
    your phpBB forum, you will need to know which directories contain important files
    and what phpBB accomplishes with each file. Some directories and files are optional,
    while others are absolutely required for a forum to function correctly. This appendix
    provides a quick summary of each directory and the files it contains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the most part, you should never rename any directory or file. There are
    exceptions to this, of course, which may include installing modifications, customizing
    aspects of your forum, or some other instances noted elsewhere in this book. When
    you do change a name, be sure you understand what you are doing. Changing directory
    or file names without making other changes will usually cause errors to appear
    on your forum when it cannot find necessary files.

- en: The majority of the directories created when you extract phpBB from a compressed
    file you have downloaded must be present on your website so that your forum works
    without errors. These basic required directories also contain most of the forum’s
    necessary files, but you will find that some files within the required directories
    are actually optional.

- en: Your forum’s main directory, which contains all the related files and other
    directories of the phpBB forum, is called the **root directory**. By default,
    this directory is named `phpBB2`. Renaming `phpBB2` is a common practice; some
    of the more popular names are `forums` and `boards`. No specific name is required;
    the internal code of phpBB will always refer to this name with a special shortcut
    notation.

- en: The directories inside the root directory, and the files stored within those
    directories, will be examined individually. Contained in the root directory itself
    are many important files, most of which are constantly accessed directly by forum
    members. These files include other files, or add their contents to the current
    code, to perform certain necessary tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Three exceptions are the `extension.inc, common.php`, and `config.php` files,
    which are included by the other files in the root directory. The following table
    lists the other files contained in the root directory and their uses, after which
    we examine the three more important files in detail.

- en: As the first file called by all pages of your forum, `extension.inc` would seem
    to be one of the most important phpBB files of all. It is a very simple file,
    however, and rarely touched at all. The sole purpose of `extension.inc` is to
    define a variable, `$phpEx`, containing the file extension associated with PHP
    code files on a server. This extension is usually `.php`, which is also the default
    setting in `extension.inc`, so the file hardly ever needs to be altered. Some
    older servers that use PHP 3 might use the extension `.php3` instead of `.php`.
    If for some reason you must use one of these, you would need to change the file
    extension in this file and rename all files ending in `.php` so that their names
    end with `.php3`.

    checking for the panel. It may also include `page_header_admin.php`, a file that
    creates the very top of administration pages. The matching `page_footer_admin.php`

- en: One of phpBB’s features is the ability to work with several different types
    of SQL database software packages. That feature is provided by use of a **database
    abstraction layer**, which is a set of files used to create a common interface
    capable of accessing each supported software package. These files are located
    in the directory named `db`. One file is provided for each supported software
    package. Your forum only uses the file for your specific database, so you can
    delete the others to conserve a little server space. If any of these files are
    deleted, you will need to restore them should you decide to change database software
    packages later. The table that follows lists the files and their matching database
    software. The `index.htm` file in `db` is just a placeholder to prevent servers
    listing the contents of the directory. These placeholder files are present in
    several of phpBB’s directories and are always named `index.htm`.

    the upgrade installer file will vary with each phpBB release, but is in the general
    format of `update_to_2xxx.php`, where `2xxx` is replaced with the version number,

    as reply or post buttons.

- en: In addition to the required directories you have just learned about, phpBB forums
    also include some directories that are optional. Some of these can be beneficial
    to have or useless in regards to the forum itself. Generally speaking, it is a
    good idea to delete these directories and their contents if you do not intend
    to use them on your website.

- en: Cached Pages
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One popular method of speeding up a forum is to add a caching system. **Caching
    systems** store code generated by the phpBB template system when a page is viewed,
    and then use that stored code when the page is viewed again. The speed boost comes
    from referencing the stored code; this is quicker than regenerating the code every
    time the page is viewed. The stored code is often saved in files in a `cache`
    directory. phpBB does not use a caching system by default, but does include a
    couple of optional systems, as you’ll see a little later. A `cache` directory
    is provided for use with one of these options.

- en: phpBB’s `docs` directory contains documentation files. By looking at these files,
    you can find such things as install and upgrade instructions, a copy of the license
    under which phpBB is released, and an FAQ about using phpBB. These files are not
    used by the forum in any way, so it is safe to delete this directory. Keep a copy
    of the files on your own computer in case you need to reference them later.

- en: The `images` directory is commonly used as a place to store image files for
    emoticons, ranks, and avatars. You can place those files in other locations within
    the forum’s directory structure, but doing so usually requires changing some configuration
    settings in the Administration Control Panel. phpBB ships with `smilies` (containing
    the default emoticons) and `avatars` subdirectories inside `images`.

- en: Beyond both the optional and required directories in phpBB’s structure, there
    are a few others. These are a bit unique. phpBB does not absolutely need to have
    them, but sometimes you do not really have a choice about including them or not.
    They are definitely worth a closer look.

- en: A special `contrib` directory is included with phpBB. It contains some extra
    add-ons you have the option of installing on your forum. To learn about these
    add-ons, read the `README.html` file in your browser. The add-ons included vary
    with each phpBB release, but you can expect to see things like the template caching
    systems mentioned previously. phpBB will not use any add-ons or other files in
    this directory unless you actively install them to the forum.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with the `install` directory, phpBB will display an error message if you
    leave the `contrib` directory in place on your website. In order for people to
    use your forum, you must delete `contrib` and all files within it.

- en: At this point, you have already learned about all of the directories and files
    that come with phpBB. While reading, you may have noted that some sections said
    modifications may add files in certain areas. The truth is, modifications can
    do anything to the directory structure of your forum, including add new directories
    or files, move existing ones, or even remove some altogether.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many modification authors have adopted a mutual standard of placing new files
    within a `mods` directory, which is added inside the root directory. phpBB does
    not include a `mods` directory when downloaded; this is a community-created concept.
    The `mods` directory typically has a subdirectory for each modification that adds
    files there, such as `prillian` for the Prillian messenger modification and `phpbb_fetch_all`
    for the phpBB Fetch All syndication modification. Using `mods` for new files keeps
    them grouped closely together and easy to find.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of `mods` is not practiced by all modification creators. Some will place
    new directories elsewhere in the forum structure. If you create modifications,
    you should place new files and directories wherever you feel comfortable. Unless
    you install modifications that use the `mods` directory, you do not need to create
    it. You will need to create the directories used by any modifications you install
    if those directories do not already exist.

- en: New language files are almost always placed within the `language` directories,
    even among authors that use the `mods` directory. Likewise, template files usually
    go within the `templates` directory. It is easier to keep track of—and use—these
    files when they are stored in these areas.
