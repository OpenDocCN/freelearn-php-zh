    "live," or blended delivery.

    plan to build courses that incorporate Moodle's activities and resources as well
    as the new functionality of Moodle 4.0\. You will be able to use the flexibility
    of Moodle to incorporate content that engages students, accommodates all kinds
    of learners, and allows multiple methods of delivery. You'll also be able to add
    activities that keep your students engaged and on tasks. In addition, you'll find
    ways for students to interact with each other and collaborate. Finally, you'll
    be able to develop a wide array of assessments that help assure that students
    can demonstrate achievement of learning objectives and course goals.
