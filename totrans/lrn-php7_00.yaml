- en: There is no need to state how much weight web applications have in our lives.
    We use web applications to know what our friends are doing, to get the latest
    news about politics, to check the results of our favorite football team in a game,
    or graduate from an online university. And as you are holding this book, you already
    know that building these applications is not a job that only a selected group
    of geniuses can perform, and that it's rather the opposite.

- en: There isn't only one way to build web applications; there are actually quite
    a lot of languages and technologies with the sole purpose of doing this. However,
    if there is one language that stands out from the rest, either historically or
    because it is extremely easy to use, it is PHP and all the tools of its ecosystem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Internet is full of resources that detail how to use PHP, so why bother
    reading this book? That's easy. We will not give you the full documentation of
    PHP as the official website does. Our goal is not that you get a PHP certification,
    but rather to teach you what you really need in order to build web applications
    by yourself. From the very beginning, we will use all the information provided
    in order to build applications, so you can note why each piece of information
    is useful.

- en: However, we will not stop here. Not only will we show you what the language
    offers you, but also we will discuss the best approaches to writing code. You
    will learn all the techniques that any web developer has to master, from OOP and
    design patterns such as MVC, to testing. You will even work with the existing
    PHP frameworks that big and small companies use for their own projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, you will start a journey in which you will learn how to master web
    development rather than how to master a programming language. We hope you enjoy
    it.

    not need to be a computer science graduate in order to understand it. In fact,
    we will assume that you have no knowledge at all of software development, neither
    with PHP nor with any other language. We will start from the very beginning so
    that everybody can follow the book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Experienced readers can still take advantage of the book. You can quickly review
    the first chapter in order to discover the new features PHP 7 comes with, and
    then focus on the chapters that might interest you. You do not need to read the
    book from start to end, but instead keep it as a guide, in order to refresh specific
    topics whenever they are needed.
