            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Note the full course name in the </span><kbd>&lt;title&gt;</kbd><span> and </span><kbd>&lt;meta&gt;</kbd><span> tags. Many search engines give a lot of weight to the title tag. If your Moodle system is open to search engines, choose your course title with this in mind</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;head&gt;<br/>      &lt;title&gt;Course: Non-Surgical Anti-Aging Services &lt;/title&gt;<br/>      &lt;link rel="shortcut icon"<br/> href="http://localhost/moodle/theme/image.php/standard/theme/1359480837/favicon" /&gt;<br/>      &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;<br/>      charset=utf-8" /&gt;<br/>      &lt;meta name="keywords" content="moodle, Course: Non-Surgical Anti-  <br/>Aging Services" /&gt;</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>&lt;head&gt;<br/>      &lt;title&gt;Course: Non-Surgical Anti-Aging Services &lt;/title&gt;<br/>      &lt;link rel="shortcut icon"<br/> href="http://localhost/moodle/theme/image.php/standard/theme/1359480837/favicon" /&gt;<br/>      <strong>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;</strong><br/><strong>      charset=utf-8" /&gt;</strong><br/>      &lt;meta name="keywords" content="moodle, Course: Non-Surgical Anti-  <br/>Aging Services" /&gt;</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git clone -b MOODLE_{{Version3}}_STABLE git://git.moodle.org/moodle.git </strong> </pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "To use conditional activities, your system administrator must enable the feature <span class="packt_screen">Enable conditional access</span> under <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span></span> | <span><span class="packt_screen">Advanced Features</span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
