<p>In the <a href="93519a70-0419-4d3d-be8a-2a66ca0cbb99.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="93519a70-0419-4d3d-be8a-2a66ca0cbb99.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Organizing Your Course</em>, we learned how to develop different types of structure for your courses and how to customize them so that they meet the needs of your institution, students, and instructors.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to look at the content of the course, which will include the course material as well as activities and assessments. We will look at the best ways to deliver your content, which involves reviewing the content, format, and tool types.</p>
<p>If you take a look at your Moodle installation, you may feel overwhelmed at the number of choices that you have.</p>
<p>We're going to streamline the approach by looking at three different categories of content: resources, activities, and assessments. Considering this approach, it will be much easier for us to cover all that we need to, in order to create a course that helps us achieve our desired learning outcomes as well as accommodate all kinds of learners.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll show you the best ways to deliver content in your Moodle course, which includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing types of content</li>
<li>Adding resources</li>
<li>Adding key activities</li>
<li>Incorporating assessments</li>
<li>Using tools to build more complex content</li>
</ul>

<p>Your Moodle course may be fairly simple with basic instructional materials, assessments, and tools for interaction. Even at its most basic, though, you'll have to be mindful of the following few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>To accommodate diverse learning styles and devices, it is best to offer your content in different formats, which includes a combination of presentations, text, audio, graphics, videos, and forums/messaging</li>
<li>To engage students and to give them a chance to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, include a range of activities such as assignments and discussion forums</li>
<li>To assess what students are learning, offer a variety of assessments such as quizzes</li>
<li>To reduce filesystem overload on the on-premises server, you may wish to use cloud-based sites, such as YouTube, SlideShare, and so on, rather than uploading large files to the Moodle server</li>
</ul>
<p>As we get started, let's keep in mind that for convenience, we're trying to start with a simple, straightforward approach. We can always increase the complexity as we go forward.</p>

<p>Resources make it possible for all the students to have access to the same course material. It's also possible for you to organize the content in a way that ties in with your course objectives, which then connects to activities and assessments.</p>
<p>There are a number of resources to choose from; however, we will focus on the ones you're most likely to use in your course. To add a resource, follow the steps found for each resource.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Book</span> resource allows you to assemble multiple pages in a single location, and to organize them with an automatically generated table of contents. The <span class="packt_screen">Book</span> resource is mobile-friendly and easy to print. It works very well with flow themes. It's convenient, particularly if you're using it for the course syllabus or an e-book text.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The downside is that you're customizing your content for a single location within your Moodle course, which makes it complicated if you're planning to use the same text for multiple courses. In that case, it's better to house your content in a single location outside Moodle and then link it in Moodle.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to add the <span class="packt_screen">Book</span> resource:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Turn editing on</span>.</li>
<li>Go to the topic where you'd like to add content and click on <span class="packt_screen">Add an activity or resource</span>.</li>
<li>Review the <span class="packt_screen">Resources</span> menu.</li>
<li>Click on the resource you want to add, such as <span class="packt_screen">Book</span>.</li>
<li>Fill in the fields on the <span class="packt_screen">Adding a new Book</span> screen, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Save and display</span>.</li>
<li>Fill in the fields on your book screen and click on <span class="packt_screen">Save changes</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may view the <span class="packt_screen">Adding a new Book</span> page in the following screenshot:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding files</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One of the easiest ways to ensure that your students are able to obtain the same content is to upload the course material via separate files. Clustering files together will allow your students to find the material for your course easily. Typical files include text files along with graphics, audio files, videos, and presentations. Keep in mind that not everyone will have the same software. We recommend that you convert your content into a PDF format so that you can upload a PDF file rather than a PowerPoint file or a text file. This will ensure that the formatting and fonts stays the same for your intellectual property to be more easily preserved, because it is harder to copy graphics from a PDF file than from a PowerPoint file. If you convert the files to PDF, your students can open them if they have installed the free Adobe Acrobat Reader. The advantage is that the formatting and fonts will not change (as your students might have different versions of presentation and word-processing software).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you are limited in terms of file size, so it is often a good idea to link to your files to a cloud-based host. If your organization uses shared content such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive, you can easily upload, and when the students log in via your organization's single sign-on, they will have access to them.</p>

<p>If you have a number of files that fall into a single category or topic, you may wish to group them together in a folder. The folder resource allows you to present many files in one place through one link on the course page.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the folder is that it allows you to avoid a cluttered page, or one that requires too much scrolling.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of using folders is that you may require too many clicks; content can be invisible or deeply buried, and thus easy for students to overlook or miss.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Use subfolders to organize the files you want to provide, but don't overdo it because they might be deeply buried and no one will notice them.</div>

<p>With the <span class="packt_screen">Page</span> resource, you're able to use the built-in web editor to create a simple website that can contain links, graphics, and embedded HTML codes. You can use an embedded HTML code and make it very easy for students to access cloud-based resources, such as videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube.com</a>, audio on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud.com</a>, presentations from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/">https://www.slideshare.net/</a>, photos and graphics on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr.com</a>, and so on. The advantage of using these resources is that they are hosted in the cloud and do not take up your space on Moodle. Further, they are open resources and do not require logins.</p>
<p>Since the embedded HTML code often contains players, it's possible to stream the media rather than having to wait for the files to download. The advantages of this include ease of access and saving time. The disadvantage is that you must be connected to the internet to stream the video files. You may prefer to download the files to your device in order to play them when you're not connected to the internet.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>You can use embedded HTML code for presentations as well. This is important for two reasons. First, you may wish to avoid bandwidth and problems caused due to slow download by hosting in the cloud. So, in that case, using services such as <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/">https://www.slideshare.net/</a> can be a lifesaver. Second, you may wish to protect intellectual property by not making it too easy to copy sensitive (and popular) graphics, charts, maps, and so on. In that case, you can protect yourself by making the presentation available in PDF format rather than PowerPoint or another easily copied and dissected format. It does not prevent your ideas from being stolen, but at least it slows down people with ill intent and makes it more difficult for them to copy and paste items.</p>
<p>For another layer of safety, you can record yourself giving your presentation on <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton.org</a> (a webinar program that is open source with free downloads for Moodle installations after Moodle 3.0) or, alternatively, you can make a movie using a screen recording program such as Camtasia or <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/">https://screencast-o-matic.com/</a>. Then, you can upload your presentation to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube.com</a> or <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr.com</a>, where it will be very difficult for anyone to copy your intellectually unique graphics.</p>

<p>The main difference between a Moodle resource and a Moodle activity is that a resource tends to be static while an activity involves student performance. Activities are used for communication, collaboration, practice, performance, and assessment. Again, the instructions are for the <span class="packt_screen">Boost</span> theme, which is the default for Moodle 3.5 and later.  MoodleCloud (also called <span class="packt_screen">Clean</span>) and more are different. </p>
<p>The following are the steps to add <span class="packt_screen">Activities</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Turn editing on</span> after clicking the gearbox in the upper right-hand corner</li>
<li>Go to the topic where you'd like to add content and click on <span class="packt_screen">Add an activity or resource</span></li>
<li>View the <span class="packt_screen">A</span><span class="packt_screen">ctivities</span></li>
<li>Click on the activity you want to add</li>
</ol>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span> module creates a structure that makes it convenient for both students and instructors to assign and turn in work, then grade it and provide feedback.</p>
<p>You can set the <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span> module for students to perform a task, and then upload a file that you will then grade. The <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span> module is an activity, and it can also be considered an assessment because you're able to set grades and criteria, and you can specify the type of submissions that you'll accept. You can also set the grading criteria by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Grade</span> link and specifying the number of points, the grade scale and method of grading, the grade category, and marking allocation. The number of points, the grade scale (these are the same thing), and the grade category can be set either through gradebook or through the <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span> settings; the method of grading (simple or advanced) can be set through the <span class="packt_screen">Grading method</span> drop-down menu.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To add an <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span>, go to the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, enter <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span>, and then add an <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span>. You can then customize the <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span> in many different ways:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Choice</span> activity is a multiple choice poll that can be used to engage students at any point during a course. It can be used as an engager, for example, in a "Did You Know?" or "Test Your Knowledge" type of single-question poll. It can also be used to quickly review facts.</p>
<p>In MoodleCloud, the <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> activity takes the place of <span class="packt_screen">Choice</span>. You can add a quiz by following the steps to add activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Site administration</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Turn editing on</span></li>
<li>Go to the topic where you'd like to add content and click on <span class="packt_screen">Plugins overview</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>View the <span class="packt_screen">Activities</span> menu</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Assignment</span></li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span></li>
</ol>
<p>You may be wondering how to add questions. To do so, you'll go to your course, then select <span class="packt_screen">Course administration</span>. Then you'll select <span class="packt_screen">Edit Settings</span>, then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Question Bank</span>. You'll be able to choose from a wide array of question types:</p>

<p>A <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span> is a powerful tool for communication and collaboration. It's also a great place to deliver content, because you can upload files or provide links to content within the different threads in the <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span> activity. The advantage of delivering content through a forum is that it's easy to ask students to respond to specific questions about the content and to keep the students focused. The downside is that it's fairly labor-intensive to use the <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span> activity to distribute content, especially if you require the same content in a number of different courses. In that case, it's easier to add it in a <span class="packt_screen">Page</span> resource.</p>
<p>For collaboration and connections, the <span class="packt_screen">Forum</span> activity is perhaps the most powerful, and it can be connected to competencies. You're able to allow forum members to rate each other's postings. The forum can have the feel of social media, without the risk of incorporating an outside social media feed.</p>

<p>A <span class="packt_screen">L</span><span class="packt_screen">esson</span> provides both content and interaction. You can include files, links, and custom pages. The basic structure of a lesson is a series of HTML pages. You can include multiple-choice questions, short answer questions, true/false questions, matching and essay-type questions—when the students select an answer, they are directed to another page. Through planning, you can create adaptive lessons, which take students on a path that is individualized according to their choices. The downside of the lesson is that it requires quite a bit of time to be set up and can be quite complex.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following screenshot is the setup screen for a lesson in the course, <span class="packt_screen">Tourism Trends II</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-389 image-border" src="assets/bbc17bdc-30b7-4493-9e8c-6ca6d912db71.png" style="width:36.50em;height:31.67em;"/></p>
<p>Here is a simplified approach that simply focuses on a lesson, which requires students to turn in an essay. So, instead of multiple-choice questions, it simply allows students to access materials, turn in an essay, and then receive feedback from the instructor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your course and click on <span class="packt_screen">Turn editing on</span>. Select <span class="packt_screen">Lesson</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Add an activity or resource</span> link.</li>
<li>Fill in the fields in the drop-down menus where you'd like to add content.</li>
<li>Go to your lesson and add content, and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Save and display</span>. You'll have the following options listed; however, in reality, it's easier to add a content page, and then add a question page. If you do so, you'll have a very straightforward lesson with questions and a graded essay that students will turn in.
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Import questions</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen"><span class="packt_screen">Add a content page</span></span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Add a cluster</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Add a question page</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may edit your instructions and provide guidance by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Add a content</span> page, which you'll include before or after the question page.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the advantages of using <span class="packt_screen">Lesson</span> is that it allows you to put the instructions, the lesson readings and materials, the questions, grading, and grade reports together in a single location. This is very convenient for students and instructors. The following screenshot shows the preview of your <span class="packt_screen">Lesson</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-391 image-border" src="assets/ce58cfbd-8990-470b-bdc3-237106bd75ab.png" style="width:36.17em;height:30.92em;"/></p>
<p>The screenshot shows the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab on a <span class="packt_screen">Lesson</span> activity's page. As you can see, at any point, you can modify the content in a number of different ways to make your lesson very robust, yet simple to follow, since the components are contained in a single place. So, students can go to a single location to take a quiz or survey, or to add readings, videos, graphics, and more.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> activity module includes a number of options, which include self-scoring questions, and ones that include feedback and the correct responses for each response so that the student has a chance to review the material. The <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> module allows you to choose the types of questions from a list of options such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Calculated</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Calculated multichoice</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Calculated simple</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Embedded answers (Cloze)</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Essay</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Matching</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Multiple choice</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Numerical</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Short answer</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">True/False</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Description</span></li>
</ul>
<p>After you have selected the type of questions, you will begin to develop a data bank. You'll fill in the question form and assign grades for the correct answer.</p>
<p>Once you've created a question, you'll add the response and feedback. Each time you add a question, you'll also be adding it to your <span class="packt_screen">Question Bank</span>. Be sure to include the question and also the response/feedback.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> activity module is a very convenient and flexible way to help students assess their knowledge. It's also a great way to deliver content (feedback and review) in a way that engages students.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that a <span class="packt_screen">Quiz</span> activity can take quite a bit of time to set up. Generally, it's not easy to create questions and responses that are psychometrically sound. For that reason, many users will opt to import question banks from the textbooks that they are using. </p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Wiki</span> activity gives you the chance to deliver content and build it at the same time. In Moodle, <span class="packt_screen">Wiki</span> is often used when it's considered desirable for class members to contribute to a single project, which would be a set of web pages on a certain topic or set of topics. The <span class="packt_screen">Wiki</span> activity can be a collection of information on a topic or examples, or it could be a report on a single topic which contains enough complexity to allow individual students to contribute, review, and edit a section or part of an entry.</p>
<p>The advantage of a <span class="packt_screen">Wiki</span> is that it's collaborative and easy to use. The disadvantage is that it can become chaotic and muddled, and one or two individuals can dominate it.</p>

<p>Assessments are not, strictly speaking, course content, but it is possible to deliver course content in a quiz or assignment. However, some assessments can be good places to deliver content, particularly if the course requires content such as maps, parts, or procedures.</p>
<p>For example, a quiz built on matching content could involve matching illustrations to a label or a concept. In that case, the content being delivered would be the diagram or graphic material. In this case, you can manage question type (you could select <span class="packt_screen">Matching</span>) and also question behaviors. Such flexibility allows you to create adaptive assessments that directly address a student's knowledge gaps and learning needs.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following graphic shows you how the <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> menu expands and gives you options for <span class="packt_screen">Questions</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-392 image-border" src="assets/fb00bfa6-aa03-4e60-bfce-edcfce39ee1c.png" style="width:43.42em;height:40.33em;"/></p>
<p>You have many options and can modify the question behavior in many ways. If you're interested in mastery learning, the adaptive mode can be very effective because it allows the students to follow a path that does not repeat the areas where they show mastery, but does repeat the questions and content area where they show gaps:</p>

<p>There are other ways that Moodle allows you to develop lessons that feature collaborative learning. For example, you can customize the <span class="packt_screen">Forums</span> so that students are required to post, download, and then respond in some way to the fellow student's uploaded file.</p>
<p>For example, a student could be required to post an informational link, such as a link to an article containing statistics on the number of states in the United States that have commercial sorghum farms. Then, another student could convert the statistics into an infographic using a program such as <a href="https://piktochart.com/">Piktochart.com</a>. The two students could then collaborate and they could put together a three-slide presentation.</p>

<p>If your collaborations include team projects, it can be incredibly helpful to incorporate applications such as Trello (<a href="http://www.trello.com">http://www.trello.com</a>) and Slack (<a href="http://www.slack.com">http://www.slack.com</a>), since it is possible to assign roles, milestones, charts, and to attach drafts, all within the Moodle framework.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Another useful productivity tool is Evernote, which you can also sync with all your devices so that it is a tool always at your side; it is useful for jotting down ideas, assignments, and notes. Other productivity tools include Google Voice, which allows you to use speech to text and to create instant transcripts.</p>

<p>Once you've built content and a delivery system, it's a good idea to reuse the course or parts of the course. You can reuse activities in a number of ways. Moodle offers you the ability to reuse your course, or part of the course, within the same Moodle system or another Moodle system by using the <span class="packt_screen">Backup<span><span> and </span></span></span><span class="packt_screen">Restore</span> functions:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-394 image-border" src="assets/c06ef59a-6f41-45fd-9361-48158ea1d8a5.png" style="width:14.33em;height:20.00em;"/></p>
<p>The following are the steps to reuse activities and parts of activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <span><span class="packt_screen">Site Administration</span> gearbox</span> pull-down menu.</li>
<li>From the options, select <span class="packt_screen">Backup</span>.</li>
<li>Check the boxes next to the types of items to back up.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> on the screen and rename the file if desired.</li>
<li>Download the file and save it to a location where you can retrieve it easily at a later date:</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-395 image-border" src="assets/fcb1c970-eb6e-4b11-882c-23954a7591bb.png" style="width:29.58em;height:42.67em;"/></p>
<p>To back up a single activity from your course, follow the same procedure. If you want to reuse content within the same Moodle site, you may simply restore it. If you want to use it on a different Moodle site, download them and save it locally.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we reviewed ways to deliver content, either by adding resources or activities. We looked at the most commonly used resources and activities and we discussed when and why they are used. We also looked at effective way to collaborate and to use productivity tools. We reviewed their advantages and disadvantages, and explained when to use them effectively in our courses.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at the connections between content delivery and assessments, and we touched on course management and how to save time by backing up activities so that they can be reused later.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at specific types of course, and learn the best ways to build them.</p>
