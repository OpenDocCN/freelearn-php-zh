    Courses with Teacher-Student Interaction*, we affirmed that when developing courses
    that are cohort-based and include teacher-student interaction, it's very important
    to maintain clarity with respect to course organization and also to establish
    excellent communication.

    clarity and good communication. It's also important to keep things as straightforward
    and simple as possible in terms of the activities you'll ask your students to
    do. After all, it can be complicated and confusing in the online environment if
    you have too many places to go and things to do at the same time.

    and also review open source applications that students can use when they collaborate
    to create documents, audio files, presentations, and videos. Our goal is to help
    you, as an instructor, administrator, instructional designer, or Moodle support
    to quickly and easily design and launch courses.

    of today, let's take the example of the fictional Centennial University. Centennial
    University has built-in collaborative projects in all their online courses. In
    the Leadership and Strategic Thinking course, for example, students must collaborate
    to analyze a business situation and create a presentation as well as documents,
    audio, and a video. While it is possible to modify a course shell from a regular
    instructor-led cohort course, it is a complex process. So, to optimize the experience
    for the users and improve the course functionality, a new shell is created for
    all courses so that they are ideal for collaborative projects.

- en: The Centennial University College of Business has decided to implement a wiki
    activity in their courses to help students learn key terms in a way that allows
    them to interact with fellow students and foster engagement with the course matter.
    For example, in the Tour Trends course, students collaborate in an Airbnb Social
    Media Marketing Strategy wiki. All students must post examples of social media
    and then contribute examples.

    by also including social interaction with their fellow learners. The wiki assignment
    should enable learners to satisfy their curiosity and research topics that are
    intrinsically interesting to them. In creating their wikis, students create HTML
    documents collaboratively and review each other's additions and changes.

    by taking a hands-on, collaborative approach. To get started, go to the topic
    that aligns most closely to the one in which you want to place your wiki and perform
    the following steps:'

    students. Students can click on Edit and then add, delete, or comment on the entry.
    To see who has added or deleted content, they can click on History and see who
    has contributed and when:'

- en: Once the students have finished contributing to the wiki, the instructor can
    grade the activity and determine grades based on the quality and quantity of student
    contributions. The instructor can click on Comments at any time during the process
    in order to give guidance. If it's done well, a wiki can create a wonderful sense
    of pride and camaraderie and be very motivating as well as informative.

- en: In this chapter, we learned the best way to develop and configure your student-centered,
    project-based courses. We focused on the fact that students will need a very clear
    structure to manage their projects and that you'll need to provide support in
    terms of links to applications that they may need in order to perform their collaborative
    activities.

- en: We took special note of how Moodle incorporated competency-based education and
    competency frameworks after Moodle 3.2\. Competency-based education can be a part
    of a portfolio or project-focused course, particularly if there is a standardized
    exit exam, and it is important to prepare the student for them.
