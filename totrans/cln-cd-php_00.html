			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">PHP</strong> has evolved over several decades from a simple scripting language for creating HTML pages to a feature-rich language with an extensive ecosystem. Because the vast majority of websites are still powered by PHP, it is one of the cornerstones of the internet.</p>
			<p>While still beginner-friendly, it can be used to implement everything from small websites to enterprise applications used worldwide. However, the low entry barriers of PHP sometimes lead to code that is difficult to understand and impossible to maintain.</p>
			<p>With this book, we want to introduce you to the world of <strong class="bold">Clean Code</strong>. You will learn a lot about the theory and also, how to apply the knowledge you learned in the real world. You will learn which tools will support you on this journey and which best practices you should use to be able to implement Clean Code successfully in your team.</p>

			<p>This book is aimed at early career PHP developers who want to understand the foundations of high-quality PHP code, and seasoned PHP developers who wish to update themselves on the latest best practices.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Part 1 – Introducing Clean Code</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this first part is to introduce the concepts of clean code and the theory behind it. This part is intended to be quite theoretical, although concrete examples will be discussed as the chapters progress. The first approach of clean code is proposed in order to explain its usefulness and why it is necessary in the life of a developer.</p>
