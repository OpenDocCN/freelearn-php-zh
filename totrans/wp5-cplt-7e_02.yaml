    could get a website was to either hire a professional who would build one for
    you, or learn web technologies and development yourself and then build one on
    your own. Nowadays, there are *more* options, and particularly if you want to

    companies anymore. Individuals, families, freelancers, or small/independent businesses
    can all benefit from a website. However, at the same time, most people don't have
    the financial resources to hire a web development company or a freelance web developer
    to create a website for them. This is where WordPress comes into play. WordPress
    is free, easy to use, and packed with excellent features. Since WordPress is a
    web application, it does not need to be installed on your home PC or Mac, or any
    other machine under your control. It can live on a server (kind of a computer)
    that belongs to a website-hosting company. Originally, WordPress was an application meant
    to run a blog website. However, it has evolved into a fully featured **content
    management system **(**CMS**). If you don't know what a blog is, don't worry,
    we explain everything later in this chapter.

- en: Starting the journey – what is a blog?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Originally, *blog* was short for *weblog*. According to Wikipedia, the term
    weblog was first used in 1997, and people started using blogs globally in 1999\.
    The terms *weblog*, *web blogging*, and *weblogger* were added to the *Oxford
    English Dictionary* in 2003, though these days most people leave off the *we* part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just to give you a more plain-English explanation, a blog is a website that
    usually contains regular entries made by an author. These entries can be of various
    types, such as commentary, descriptions of events, photos, videos, personal remarks,
    tutorials, case studies, long opinion pieces, political ideas, or whatever else
    you can imagine. They are usually displayed in reverse chronological order, with
    the most recent additions at the top. Those entries can be organized in a variety
    of ways, by date, topic, subject, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main characteristics of a blog is that it's meant to be updated regularly.
    Unlike a website where the content is static, a blog behaves more like an online
    diary, wherein the blogger posts regular updates. Hence, blogs are dynamic with
    ever-changing content. A blog can be updated with new content and the old content
    can be changed or deleted at any time (although deleting content is not a common
    practice).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most blogs focus their content on a particular subject, for example, current
    events, hobbies, niche topics, and technical expertise. This doesn't mean that
    blogs are meant to be published only by individuals sharing their personal opinions
    on given matters. On the contrary, these days, blogs have become a significant
    part in the online presence for many businesses and even corporations. The modern
    practice of *content marketing* is now one of the most widely accepted web marketing
    methods, and its core is based on publishing quality content, often in blog form.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are new to the world of blogging (sometimes called the *blogosphere*,
    which is a fairly popular expression these days), you may want to familiarize
    yourself with the following common terms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Post
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each entry in the blog is called a **post**. Every post usually has a number
    of different parts. Of course, the two most obvious parts are the title and content.
    The **content** is text, images, links, and so on. Posts can even contain multimedia
    (for example, videos and audio files). Every post also has a publication timestamp,
    and most have one or more categories and tags assigned to them. It is these posts,
    or entries, that are often displayed in reverse chronological order on the main
    page of the blog. By default, the latest post is displayed first, in order to
    give the viewer the latest news on a subject.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Categories and tags
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Categories** and **tags** are ways to organize and find posts within a blog and
    even across blogs. Categories are like topics, while tags are more like keywords.
    For example, for a blog about food and cooking, there might be a category called **recipes**,
    but every post in that category might have different tags (for example, *soup*,
    *baked*, *vegetarian*, and *dairy-free*).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose and correct usage of tags and categories are one of the widely discussed
    topics among bloggers. Although there are basic guidelines such as the ones presented
    here, every blogger develops their own approach after a while, and there are no *written
    in stone* rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Comments
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most blogs allow visitors to post comments on the posts. This gives readers
    the opportunity to interact with the author of the blog, thus making the whole
    experience interactive. Often, the author of the blog will respond to comments
    by posting additional comments with a single click on the reply button, which
    makes for a continuous public online conversation or dialog.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Comments are said to be one of the most important assets for a blog. The presence
    of a large number of comments shows how popular and authoritative the blog is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Themes
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **theme** is the design and layout package that you can choose for your blog.
    On most blogs, the content (for example, posts) is separate from the visual appearance.
    This means you can change the visuals of your blog at any time without having
    to worry about the content being affected. One of the best things about themes
    is that it takes only minutes to install and start using a new one. Moreover,
    there are a number of very good free or low-cost themes available online.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That being said, you need to be careful when working with free themes from uncertain
    developers. Often, they contain encrypted parts and code that can hurt your site
    and its presence on Google. Always look for user reviews before choosing a theme.
    Most importantly, the safest bet is getting your free themes only from the official
    WordPress directory at [https://wordpress.org/themes/](https://wordpress.org/themes/).
    The themes there have been tested and checked for any suspicious code.

- en: WordPress plugins are relatively small pieces of web software that can be installed
    on any WordPress site. They extend the native functionality to do almost anything
    that the technology of today allows. Just like WordPress itself, the code within
    plugins is open source, which means that anyone can build a new plugin if they
    have the required skill set. Every WordPress website or blog can work with an
    unlimited number of plugins (although it is not a recommended approach). The most
    popular functionalities introduced through plugins include spam protection, **search
    engine optimization** (**SEO**), caching, social media integration, interactive
    contact forms, and backups.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Widgets** are a simplified version of plugins. The most common usage of widgets is
    to have them showcased in the sidebars on your site. Typically, your current theme
    will provide you with a number of widget areas where you can display widgets (as
    mentioned, many of these are located in the sidebar). Some of the common usages
    for widgets is to display content such as categories and tags, recent posts, popular
    posts, recent comments, links to archived posts, pages, links, search fields,
    or standard non-formatted text.'

- en: Menus
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to talk some history to explain the meaning of menus in WordPress. Back
    in the day, WordPress didn't allow much customization in terms of tweaking navigation
    menus and handpicking the links we wanted to display. This changed in Version
    3.0, whereby the new *Custom Menus* feature was introduced. In plain English,
    it allows you to create completely custom menus (featuring any links of your choice)
    and then display them in specific areas on your site. To be honest, this feature,
    even though it sounds basic, is one of the main ones that has turned WordPress
    into a full-fledged web publishing platform. I promise this will sound much clearer
    in the upcoming chapters.

- en: Page
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's important to understand the difference between a page and a post. Unlike
    posts, pages do not depend on timestamps and are not displayed in reverse chronological
    order. Also, they do not have categories or tags. A page is a piece of content
    with only a title and content (an example would be *About Me* or *Contact Us—*the
    two most popular pages on almost any blog). It is likely that the number of pages
    on your blog remains relatively static, while new posts can be added every day
    or so.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **home page** is simply the main page that visitors see when they visit your
    website by typing in your domain name or URL address. In the early days of WordPress's
    existence, a home page wasn't something we used to talk about as a separate kind
    of page. Originally, a home page was generated automatically from the newest posts—it
    was a listing of those posts in reverse chronological order. Right now, however,
    WordPress allows us to build a completely custom home page and display whatever
    content we wish on it.

- en: Users
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned earlier, WordPress is now a complete web publishing platform. One
    of its characteristics is that it is capable of working with multiple user accounts,
    not just a single account belonging to the owner (admin/main author) of the site.
    There are different types of user accounts available, and they have different
    credentials and access rights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WordPress is clearly trying to resemble a traditional publishing house where
    there are *authors*, *editors*, and other *contributors* all working together.
    Even though the option to create an unlimited number of user accounts won't be
    that impressive for anyone planning to manage a site on their own, it can surely
    be a more-than-essential feature for big, magazine-like websites.
