<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>PhpStorm is a smart PHP IDE that gets your code and understands its structures. It provides code autocompletion, refactoring, syntax highlighting, and much more. PhpStorm makes debugging and testing really easy, especially with debugger configuration validation.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>PhpStorm Cookbook</em></span> contains several tutorials that will allow you to run PHP development at a good pace by helping you test and debug, which is often ignored by developers.</p><p>The book starts off focusing on how to cook using PhpStorm, gives you an overview of PHP development, and then dives deep into the details of refactoring and building your project using the PhpStorm IDE. After that, it moves to integrating frameworks and testing and debugging them. We then move on to using PhpStorm in a team, using Phing and cooking plugins. We conclude that this book will be of a great help to a PHP programmer who loves to use IDE and looks forward to working faster.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
