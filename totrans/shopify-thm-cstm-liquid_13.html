			<p>Through the years of helping developers adapt to Liquid, specific situations and questions have arisen to which answers are not so easy to come by. We will now list the most frequent situations and offer some advice that will help improve your knowledge of both Shopify and Liquid and make your work that much easier:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em class="italic">Is it possible to find the location of some particular code inside the code editor without manually searching every template, section, or snippet?</em><p>One of the biggest problems that the developers have when starting to work with <strong class="bold">Shopify</strong> is that they have trouble finding a specific piece of code across different templates, sections, and snippets. While after some time, we do get used to finding things more efficiently, it can be pretty troublesome at the start. </p><p>To help us with this, we can use a nifty little <strong class="bold">Chrome</strong> addon called <strong class="bold">Shopify Theme Search by Bold</strong>. This little addon provides us with a search input inside the code editor to type in any string that we are looking for. After a few seconds, it will highlight every directory and file that contains any occurrence of the searched string. You can read more about it at <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-theme-search-by-b/epbnmkionkpliaiogpemfkclmcnbdfle">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-theme-search-by-b/epbnmkionkpliaiogpemfkclmcnbdfle</a>.</p></li>
				<li><em class="italic">No matter how many new duplicate themes we create, for some reason, the duplicate theme does not have any of the previous customizations saved.</em> <em class="italic">What should we do in this case?</em><p>The second most problematic issue happens during the theme duplication process. After creating a theme duplicate, we may notice that the duplicate theme has reset entirely. It does not contain any of the customizations that we had previously set inside the theme editor.</p><p>The problem lies inside the <strong class="source-inline">settings_data.json</strong> file, which, if we open it, we will see is empty, and in some instances, the file might be missing altogether. The reason for this occurrence is apparent – Shopify did not copy the file's content correctly – but the question is <em class="italic">why?</em> If we were to navigate to the theme from which we initially created a duplicate, open the <strong class="source-inline">settings_data.json</strong> file, and try to copy its content to the new duplicate theme, we would not be able to save the file due to an error inside the JSON file. If we try to save the copied content to a new file, Shopify will not allow it and instead provide us with an error code of the problematic value.</p><p>To resolve this, we will need to manually search for every value that we received inside the error and update it accordingly. Possible issues could be that we have entirely deleted a particular section block without first removing the block from inside the theme editor. Shopify will keep trying to load the block. However, since we have deleted it, it will not be able to, and it will break the JSON file. The second most frequent issue comes up when using the <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> input type, where the current value of the input exceeds the range between the min and max values. Only after resolving all of these issues will we be able to save the file correctly.</p></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Is it possible to recover a deleted theme?</em><p>Each store allows us to keep up to 20 duplicate themes as a backup and up to 50 duplicate themes on the <strong class="bold">Shopify Plus</strong> plan. If we delete a theme file for any reason and do not have a backup file saved on GitHub or somewhere locally, the file will be permanently lost, and we will not be able to recover it in any way.</p></li>
				<li><em class="italic">How can we find which app is being used by a particular store?</em><p>While it is not possible to see every type of app that a store is using, we can retrieve the names of most of the apps by using the <strong class="bold">Shopify App Detector by Fera.ai</strong> or <strong class="bold">Koala Inspector - Inspect Shopify Shops</strong> Chrome addons. You can find more info on Shopify App Detector by Fera.ai using the following link: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-app-detector-by-f/lhfdhjladfcmghahdbcmlceajdlbkale">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-app-detector-by-f/lhfdhjladfcmghahdbcmlceajdlbkale</a>.</p><p>You can find more info on Koala Inspector - Inspect Shopify Shops using the following link: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/koala-inspector-inspect-s/hjbfbllnfhppnhjdhhbmjabikmkfekgf">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/koala-inspector-inspect-s/hjbfbllnfhppnhjdhhbmjabikmkfekgf</a>.</p></li>
				<li><em class="italic">How can we easily identify the Liquid code that is slowing down the store?</em><p>To help us with this, Shopify has introduced an addon named <strong class="bold">Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome</strong>, which we can use to retrieve a detailed analysis render profiling and help us narrow down which files are causing the most significant delay. We can find more info on Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome using the following link: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-theme-inspector-f/fndnankcflemoafdeboboehphmiijkgp">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-theme-inspector-f/fndnankcflemoafdeboboehphmiijkgp</a>.</p></li>
				<li><em class="italic">When we try to send a collaborator account request to the client using the Shopify partners platform, for some reason, we keep getting the message that the store URL is not associated to a shop.</em> <em class="italic">How can we resolve this?</em><p>The reason for this is that in most cases, store owners have set up a custom domain whose URL is quite different than the <a href="http://myshopify.com">myshopify.com</a> URL that we require to send them a collaborator account request, so replacing the <strong class="source-inline">.com</strong> with <strong class="source-inline">.myshopify.com</strong> will not resolve our problem. We can easily resolve this by simply navigating to the URL they have provided us by opening the inspector and typing <strong class="source-inline">Shopify</strong> inside the console, which will prompt a set of various information about the store. Among that, we will find a correct <a href="http://myshopify.com">myshopify.com</a> URL. Note that the <strong class="source-inline">Shopify</strong> keyword is case-sensitive.</p></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Does the Shopify code editor have a dark mode?</em><p>The answer is yes! But it is pretty hidden. In order to reveal it, navigate to the code editor and click on the button to expand the editor screen. We can find it in the top-right corner of the editor screen. Once we have expanded the editor screen, we will notice that we now have two scroll bars on our right. If we scroll down to the bottom of the page, we will find the <strong class="bold">White</strong> and <strong class="bold">Black</strong> buttons allowing us to change the color mode of the editor. However, note that the editor will revert to its default color when we close the expanded editor view.</p></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Is there a way to automatically format the code inside the Liquid files?</em><p><em class="italic">The answer is yes! </em>We can highlight the entire Liquid file inside the code editor using the <em class="italic">CTRL + A</em> and then press <em class="italic">Shift + Tab</em>, automatically formatting the entire file accordingly. However, while auto-formatting will be helpful with most files, note that automatic formatting does not work on the <strong class="source-inline">section</strong> schema tag and its content.</p></li>
