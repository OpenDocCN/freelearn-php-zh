You're going to learn about user types and how Drupal provides a way for you to ensure that no one has more access than they require. More specifically, this chapter covers the following topics:</p>

<p>In the context of a <strong>Content Management System</strong> (<strong>CMS</strong>), a user is simply someone who uses the site. If that were all there is to it, if everyone were always the same in the <em>eyes</em> of Drupal, we could stop right here. So, you won't be surprised to read that all users are not necessarily the same. Of course, I'm not referring to the personal aspects of the users when I write that; I mean that users are not necessarily all the same in terms of their reason for accessing the site and what ability they are given to do so.</p>
<p>If we look at USERS as a top-level classification with the thought of further classifying them, doing so depends on a choice: are we classifying them in a real-world sort of way, or as Drupal does? In the following table we see them compared: </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">

<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">From the real-world point of view, we tend to categorize users based on their functional relationship with the site. If you think of these relationships in the context of a home, some might simply live there and consume food (think teenagers), some will contribute to the look and contents of the home, and others will be responsible for maintaining it. Yes, a user can appear in more than one category, as shown in the following table:</p>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><span>From the Drupal point of view, it pretty much comes down to what you will be allowed to do on the site and whether you require an account to do so. For example, some sites allow unknown site visitors to read the content and comment on it. Others only allow access to the content for them without commenting, and others do not allow anonymous access at all. Returning to the analogy of a home, those who can do whatever they like to it have administrative access; those who are allowed to enter have authenticated access, albeit with different "roles", such as friends versus residents; and those who come to the front door (if there is no gatekeeper or doorman preventing that) who are unknown are anonymous.</span></p>
<div>
<p>For the most part, <em>Consumer</em> users are <em>Anonymous</em>, with some premium or secure content requiring them to be <em>Authenticated</em>. <em>Creative</em> users are typically <em>Authenticated</em>. And <em>Administrators</em> are usually always, <em>Administrative</em>. The takeaway is this: <span>sites vary, and so does the segregation, if any, of user types.</span></p>

<p>To Drupal, a <em>role</em> has the same meaning as it does outside of Drupal: the functional aspect of the user, sometimes considered a <em>persona</em>. It's worth mentioning that Drupal does blur the line a bit between a role and a user type, because it comes with three roles predefined, and they are the user types mentioned earlier. While <em>administrator</em> makes sense as a role, <em>authenticated</em> and <em>anonymous</em> are not really roles, but appear there to simplify things, for administrators, at least.</p>
<p>So, let's take a look at the default user roles inside of Drupal before we move on to discussing why you would want additional ones. If you are using the menus, click <em><span class="packt_screen">People</span></em> in the <span class="packt_screen">Admin</span> menu (<kbd>admin/people</kbd>), and then click the tab labeled <em>Roles</em>, as in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7487d629-2b0f-42e8-8300-24d1211518a6.png" style="width:71.92em;height:38.58em;"/></p>
<p>The preceding screenshot shows the roles that are predefined in Drupal. I disagree with the given description of a role, because it is unclear. The order of operation in Drupal is that privileges are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to users. We'll discuss that more when we add a user and when we assign some permissions, later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>For now, let's focus on the default Drupal roles themselves. As I mentioned earlier, <em>anonymous</em> and <em>authenticated</em> are actually more user types than roles, but in Drupal they are referred to as roles. When would these three roles, alone, be sufficient? One example would be a site where all users with logins can create content, and all users that have no login can only view that content. If those are the limits to your organizational and site complexity, you can jump ahead to the section on <em>User Creation</em> if you'd like.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Let us consider. The anonymous role stands on its own. Why? Because it is defined as a user with no account or login, which is to say, a user that is not identified. We would not assign the role of <em>Anonymous</em> to a user account, because if there is an account, the user of it is no longer anonymous. There would be no sense in creating different roles for anonymous users, because there would be no user accounts to assign those roles. So, that leaves us with the other two roles, and we can use those to derive examples.</p>
<p class="mce-root">On our site, we will have four types of non-administrative authenticated users. The first will be authenticated users in general. That is, users with this role will be able to login, and in addition to being able to see the <span class="packt_screen">Article</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Page</span> site content that <span class="packt_screen">Anonymous</span> and all users can see, they will be able to see content of the <span class="packt_screen">Appointment</span> type we defined, as well.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This could be our use of the Authenticated role, since all users logging in will have those capabilities at a minimum, but we won't use that role for it. Why? Because we have to account for the possibility that later there might be the need to have some users who can log in but cannot access appointment data. In general, I prefer to leave the predefined roles  unchanged for that reason...use them as a model instead, or as is. So, we will call the new role <span class="packt_screen">Client</span>.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">One thing to keep in mind when creating new roles for a logged-in user is that because the user is logged in, and thus also an authenticated user, the user will receive all the permissions assigned to the <span class="packt_screen">Authenticated</span> role, too. </div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>There will be three additional roles for authenticated users on our site:  <span class="packt_screen">Client</span>, who is able to view appointments; <span class="packt_screen">Consultant</span>, who is able to create and edit appointments; and <span class="packt_screen">Editor</span>, who is able to create and edit content other than appointments. The complete list of our user roles and their use are given in this table:</p>

<p>All roles are now available for use. However, their capabilities have not yet been defined. Since we've covered all that we need to regarding the creation of roles, let's move on to the topic of permissions.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>Any page element that a user can view or hear or otherwise interact with, such as a menu link, is available for doing so because the user, via a role, has been given permission to do so. </span>This is a very important concept, so I will give an example. You have no doubt seen a <em>Terms and Conditions</em> link on most sites.</p>
<p>On a Drupal site, if you see such a link, it is because your user role has been granted permission to access that content (the <span class="packt_screen">Terms and Conditions</span> page). Were that permission not granted for your user, the link would probably not be visible. Were it still visible, or were you to enter the URL for the page in your browser, you would receive a message stating that you have not been granted access to that content. </p>
<p>Because permissions can be granular and detailed, there are a lot of them, and adding modules will typically add more to the list. We're going to focus on a subset of them to keep things simple.</p>
<p>With that warning, let's take a look by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Permissions</span> tab at the top of the page, which will take us to <kbd>admin/people/permissions</kbd>.</p>
<p>The structure of the permissions page is all permissions provided in a scrollable table. Across the top of the table are the roles defined on the site. You'll see that they are the same as those that were listed earlier. Down the left-most column of the table is the list of permissions for actions categorized by alphabetical topic and/or name of the module that defines them. </p>
<p>The manner of management is quite simple. If a box is checked, that column's role has the listed permission. For example, looking at the first permission, which is associated with the <em>Block</em> module, the ability to <em>Administer blocks</em> has been granted only to those users having the <span class="packt_screen">Administrator</span> role.</p>
<p>Rather than scroll down and up for each of the roles, we'll approach this by permission, so that we only have to scroll once. In the following table, I will provide each of the categories and permissions within it that require our attention, as well as what the checkboxes should look like after you have checked the appropriate ones to accomplish the grants we defined earlier for our roles.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">We will not be changing any of the settings in the <span class="packt_screen">Administrator</span> column, but I have included it so that the relative position of each role is as you see it on your screen.</div>
<p><span>I will only provide rows for those permissions that require a setting change. For example, you will notice under the category of Comment that already all authenticated user types have the ability to p</span>ost <span>comments, while Anonymous users have the ability to</span> view c<span>omments, so no changes are needed, which is why that row won't appear in this table:</span></p>

<p>Most of the permissions in the preceding table relate to CRUD operations on specific content types. That is, being able to create (add), edit (update) and delete content of a specific type, such as the <em>Appointment</em> type that we created. You can see that we granted permission to perform such operations to Consultants, but not to Editors, whereas we granted permission to perform those same operations on <em>Article</em> content to Editors, but not to Consultants.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="packt_tip">Access rights, permissions, take effect immediately. That is, even if you have permission to perform a certain action or access a type of content, were that permission to be removed from your role, your access to that action/content would then be gone, unless and until it is reinstated.</div>
<p>You will notice that some of the permission descriptions look very similar, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appointment: Edit own content</li>
<li>Appointment: Edit any content</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between the two is that with the second, the user is able to edit Appointment content regardless of who created it, whereas with the first, the user needs to have created it. </p>
<p>The final permission, <em>View own unpublished content</em>, is worth noting as well. Unless this permission is granted, if a new piece of content is saved as <em>unpublished</em>, its author can no longer access it, only being able to access content marked <em>published</em>. With this permission, the user can also access his unpublished content, which is necessary for working with drafts.</p>
<p>You might also notice that permissions for reading/viewing specific content types were not present. That is because, while there is a permission for viewing published content, that is as granular as the permissions get for viewing content; there are no permissions regarding viewing a particular content type. There is, however a module that provides those permissions, which we will add in <a href="1787223e-41c7-44c4-9ab3-fc0f2cee3fa5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Making Drupal Even More Useful</em>. Once we have those permissions available to grant, we can ensure that only the roles we select can comment on a specific content type, because if you can't view the content, you can't comment on it!</p>

<p>We've created the roles specific to our site and assigned to them the permissions that grant them the access that they need. The only thing we're missing now...are users. Each user needs an account. Where do they come from?</p>
<p>There are three ways that most users obtain a Drupal account:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user with permissions to create a user account does so on the user's behalf</li>
<li>The user registers for an account</li>
<li>The user obtains an account via <strong>single sign-on</strong> (<strong>SSO</strong>), such as through a Facebook account</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Of these, the latter method is out of scope for this book, as it is a more in-depth administrative topic. Let's take a look at the other two.</p>

<p class="mce-root">We're going to learn how to create a user account. Some sites choose to allow users to create an account that immediately becomes active with no review, some choose to require the account to stay inactive until an administrative user approves it, which is what we will emulate here, and some create all user accounts administratively and do not allow users to register.</p>
<p>Let's create an account for an editor, one of the roles we created. If you still have a page up with the tabs for <span class="packt_screen">List</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Permissions</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Roles</span> at the top, click <span class="packt_screen">List</span>. Otherwise, you can either click <span class="packt_screen">People</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Admin</span> menu, or navigate to <kbd>admin/people</kbd>. Here is how we create an account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">+ Add user</span> button, which will bring you to the <span class="packt_screen">Add user</span> page, <kbd>admin/people/create</kbd>.</li>
<li>For <span class="packt_screen">Email address</span>, you can enter a real one if you have it, or a fake one (<kbd>@example.com</kbd> is a good domain to use for fake email addresses and URLs).</li>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">Username</span> can be anything. Our editor will be <em>Edie Editor</em>, so I'll make her username <kbd>Edie</kbd>.</li>
<li>Choose something you'll remember for a password. The user can change the password once logged in. To get a green bar (strong password) try <kbd>Password123</kbd>. Enter your choice again in the <span class="packt_screen">Confirm password</span> field.</li>
<li>For <span class="packt_screen">Status</span>, leave the setting at <span class="packt_screen">Active</span>. If you ever want to create a user account in advance but not make it immediately active, you would select <span class="packt_screen">Blocked</span>.</li>
<li>Under <span class="packt_screen">Roles</span>, check the box for <span class="packt_screen">Editor</span> to give this user that role.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox"><span>You'll notice that</span> <span class="packt_screen">Roles</span> has <span class="packt_screen">Authenticated</span> <span>selected and that it cannot be unselected. That is because all users with accounts are authenticated, by definition. </span></div>

<li>We're going to leave <span class="packt_screen">Notify users of new account</span> unchecked. Normally, you would check this so that an email would be sent to the new user, but we do not want an email sent in this case.</li>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">Picture</span> is nice when there will be something akin to blog articles, where the author has a photo, but we won't use one.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>Will your content editors want to be contacted via the website? If so, leave the next check box for <span class="packt_screen">Personal contact form</span> selected.</li>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">Time zone</span> selection assures that the user sees times displayed based on their time zone, rather than the time zone in which the web server is located.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having addressed all the fields, click <span class="packt_screen">Create new account</span>. You will stay on the <span class="packt_screen">Add user</span> page, with a message similar to the following screenshot at the top:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/467c8dbe-93de-4900-a122-1d33a6546453.png" style="width:33.25em;height:4.17em;"/></p>
<p>When users are allowed to request an account by registering, there are typically two ways it can be handled, depending on your site configuration: the registration can result in an immediately active account, or the user account will be created as <span class="packt_screen">Blocked</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Inactive</span>, until it is approved.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">User registration is configured at <span class="packt_screen">Configuration</span> | <span class="packt_screen">People</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Account settings</span> (<kbd>/admin/config/people/accounts</kbd>). Learn more at: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/config-user.html">https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/config-user.html</a>.</div>
<p>To approve it, you would edit the account from the user list, change the status from <span class="packt_screen">Blocked</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Active</span>, and assign the user whichever roles are needed. The only role that will be preselected is <span class="packt_screen">Authenticated</span>, just as when we created a user.</p>

<p>We've looked at the major facets of managing users, including roles and permissions. Ensuring that users have the proper roles and that those roles give them access to only the functionality they should have is essential for the security of your content and the site.</p>
<p>Now that we have a site, some content types, and an editor with the proper permissions for working with content, it's time to spend some time on the topic most central to a Content Management System: the content, and that's just what we'll do in <a href="5dc26faf-5b24-463c-9587-e06ec89742a7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating and Editing Content</em>.</p>
