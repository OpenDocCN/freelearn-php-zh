			<p>This chapter will help us understand what Liquid is and learn the basics of Liquid to provide us with the essential knowledge needed to master it. We will split the chapter into the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is Liquid?</li>
				<li>Understanding Liquid and its delimiters</li>
				<li>Learning the comparison operators</li>
				<li>Working with logic operators</li>
				<li>Understanding the types of data</li>
				<li>Controlling whitespace</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, we will gain a deeper understanding of Liquid logic, the type of operators we can use to manipulate the various types of data, and the Liquid way of removing those pesky whitespace characters. By learning how to use logical operators and manipulate handle attributes, we will gain valuable knowledge of producing various dynamic features, setting our skills on the correct path toward writing quality and complex code.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>What is Liquid?</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we gained the first insights into Shopify. We learned what Shopify is, how to <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>create Shopify Partner accounts, and how to manage our theme. Finally, we have learned about theme structure, the directories it contains, and some essential files in our <strong class="source-inline">Layout</strong> directory, at which point we might have noticed that most of our files contain the <strong class="source-inline">.liquid</strong> extension. <em class="italic">So what exactly is Liquid?</em> </p>
			<p>Liquid is an open source project created by Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobias Lütke. As a template language, Liquid variables connect the Shopify store's data to the static HTML content in our <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>theme, allowing us to turn the static template page into a fully dynamic and powerful e-commerce store and producing impressive results. We can also consider Liquid elements as placeholders that will only get populated with proper data after the code inside the file is compiled and sent to the browser.</p>
			<p>Ever since 2006, Liquid has been growing and evolving. Today, many different web applications rely on Liquid, Shopify being one of those, which shows that the need for Liquid is ever-growing. Learning Liquid is a great way to advance your knowledge further, and with its easy-to-learn syntax, we will master Liquid and be able to create complex functionality in no time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Understanding Liquid and its delimiters</h1>
			<p>One of the two ways that we can discern a Liquid file is by the extension <strong class="source-inline">.liquid</strong>. Being a template language, a Liquid file is a combination of <em class="italic">static and dynamic content</em>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Elements that <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>we write in HTML are called <strong class="bold">static content</strong>, and they stay <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>the same no matter what page we are currently on.</li>
				<li>On the other side, elements <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>written in Liquid are called <strong class="bold">dynamic content</strong> elements, whose <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>content changes depending on the page we are on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While our browsers can quickly process the HTML code, they would not know what to do with Liquid code as they do not understand it. We can break up the flow of what happens when we submit a<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> Shopify URL to our browser into five logical steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The Shopify server tries to determine which store we are trying to access.</li>
				<li>Depending on the type of page we are currently requesting information for, Shopify tries to locate and select the proper Liquid template from the active theme directory.</li>
				<li>After successfully identifying the Liquid template that we require, the Shopify server starts replacing the placeholders with actual data stored on the Shopify platform.</li>
				<li>Once Shopify has finished replacing the placeholders and performing any logic located inside the selected template, our browser will receive the compiled HTML file.</li>
				<li>Now that our <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>browser has received the HTML file as a response, the browser starts processing the file and fetches all other required assets, including JavaScript, stylesheets, images, and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The second way that we can <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>distinguish Liquid files and code is by its two delimiters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">{{ }}</strong> double curly braces are used to indicate that we are expecting an output. An example Liquid code where we are expecting an output is as follows:<p class="source-code">Our collection name is <strong class="bold">{{ collection.title }}</strong></p><p>In the previous line, we see a string, followed by <strong class="source-inline">{{ collection.title }}</strong>. As we can see, <strong class="source-inline">collection.title</strong> is encapsulated inside the double curly braces indicating that the result of the code will be output. After the Shopify server processes our Liquid code and returns us something that our browser can work with, we would receive the following string as a result:</p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Our collection name is Winter Shoes</strong></p></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">{% %}</strong> curly braces with a percentage, on the other hand, are used if we want to indicate that we are looking to perform some kind of logic.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In our last example, we were able to see the result of using <strong class="source-inline">{{ collection.title }}</strong> to recover the name of the collection. Now, <em class="italic">what if we wanted to show the collection description, but for some reason, the </em><strong class="source-inline">collection description</strong><em class="italic"> field did not return anything?</em> We would have ended up with an incomplete message:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Our collection description is</p>
			<p>To ensure that this does not happen, we can check whether the data value exists using Liquid logic and comparison operators combined with some Shopify data types.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Learning the comparison operators</h1>
			<p>With Liquid, we have access to seven comparison operators, which we can combine to create any type of logical flow <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>that our code requires. Let's review them as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">==</strong> operator <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>allows us to check whether the element we are comparing is equal to some value:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.title <strong class="bold">==</strong> "Winter Shoes" %}</p><p class="source-code">  Winter Shows collection found!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>If <strong class="source-inline">collection.title</strong> is strictly equal to our string of <strong class="source-inline">"Winter Shows"</strong>, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and we will see our message shown. Otherwise, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. Note that comparison will only return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> if the string is an exact match, including the text case.</p></li>
				<li>The<strong class="source-inline">!=</strong> operator <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>works similarly to the previous operator. The difference is that this operator checks whether the element we are comparing is not equal to some value:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.title <strong class="bold">!=</strong> "Winter Shows" %}</p><p class="source-code">  Winter Shows collection is not found!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>As with the previous example, we will be using <strong class="source-inline">collection.title</strong>, but in this case, we will be checking whether the collection's name is not equal to the <strong class="source-inline">"Winter Shows"</strong> string. If the result is that <strong class="source-inline">collection.title</strong> is not the same as our string, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and we will see our message shown. Otherwise, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and the message will not be visible.</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">&gt;</strong> operator <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>allows us to check whether the compared value is greater than the comparing value:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.all_products_count <strong class="bold">&gt;</strong> 25 %}</p><p class="source-code">  The collection has more than 25 products!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>Here, we are checking whether the number of all products in a collection is greater than <strong class="source-inline">25</strong>. If it is, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and we will see our message shown. Otherwise, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and the message will not be visible.</p></li>
				<li>Similarly, as in the previous example, we will be checking the number of products in our collection, however, in this case, we will be using the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;</strong> operator, which returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> only if the comparing value is less than the value being compared to:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.all_products_count <strong class="bold">&lt;</strong> 25 %}</p><p class="source-code">  The collection has less than 25 products!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>If the number of products in the collection is less than <strong class="source-inline">25</strong>, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and we will see our message shown. Otherwise, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and the message will not be visible.</p><p>We have a general <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>understanding of how the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">&gt;</strong> operators works, but what if we had the following example:</p><p class="source-code">{% if collection.all_products_count <strong class="bold">&gt;</strong> "25" %}</p><p class="source-code">  The collection has more than 25 products!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>As we recall, the <strong class="source-inline">&gt;</strong> operator allows us to check whether the compared value is greater than the comparing value. If it is, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and our message will show. However, if we were to run our code now, the logic would return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and we would not see our message. <em class="italic">Why?</em></p><p>If we look at our example, we will notice that we have quotation marks encapsulating our comparing value, which means that our comparing-to value is a string, compared to our <strong class="source-inline">collection.all_products_count</strong>, which returns a number. As we have mentioned before, the comparison operators will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> only when we have met the exact conditions that the operator requires. In our current example, for our message to be made visible, two conditions must be met.</p><p>The first condition is that both values must be the same data type, meaning that we cannot mix two types of data as we did just now. We would need to remove the quotation marks from our comparing-to value, consequently turning it from a string to a number data type. </p><p>The second condition is that our comparing value is greater than the compared to value. Once we have met the two conditions, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and our message will be shown.</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">&gt;=</strong> operator <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>allows us to check whether the element we are comparing is greater than or equal to the comparing value:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.all_products_count <strong class="bold">&gt;=</strong> 25 %}</p><p class="source-code">  The collection has more or an exact number of    products as the comparing value!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>Since both values are the same data type, if the number of products is greater or equal, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and we will see our message shown. Otherwise, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and the message will not be visible.</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">&lt;=</strong> operator allows <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>us to check if the compared value is less than or equal to the comparing value:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.all_products_count <strong class="bold">&lt;=</strong> 25 %}</p><p class="source-code">  The collection has less or an exact number of    products as the comparing value!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>Similarly, as with our previous comparing element, we check whether the total number of products in our collection is less than or equal to the compared value. If we have met the condition, the logic returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and our message will show. Otherwise, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and the message will not be visible.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Working with logic operators</h1>
			<p>Besides comparison operators, we also have access to two logic operators, which allow us to combine <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>multiple conditions to create complex statements. We can divide them into the two following groups:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">or</strong> operator allows us to set multiple conditionals, where we must meet at least one of them:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.title == "Winter Shoes" <strong class="bold">or</strong>  collection.all_products_count &gt; 25 %}</p><p class="source-code">  The collection name is Winter Shows, or the    collection contains more than 25 products!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>In the preceding example, we check whether the name of our collection is equal to <strong class="source-inline">Winter Shoes</strong> or if the collection contains more than <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> products. If we have met at least one of these two conditions, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and our message will be shown. Otherwise, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and the message will not be visible.</p></li>
				<li>Similarly, the <strong class="source-inline">and</strong> operator allows us to set multiple conditions. However, for this operator to return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, all conditions must be met:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.title == "Winter Shoes" <strong class="bold">and</strong>  collection.all_products_count &gt; 25 %}</p><p class="source-code">  The collection name is Winter Shoes, and the    collection contains more than 25 products!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>In this example, we are trying to see if both conditions have been met by checking whether <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>the collection name is equal to <strong class="source-inline">Winter Shoes</strong> and the collection contains more than <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> products. If we have met both of these conditions, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and the message will be shown. Otherwise, the logic will return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and the message will not be visible.</p><p class="callout-heading">Important note:</p><p class="callout">We can now create a conditional with multiple comparison values. However, we should note the order in which our conditional will perform the check is from the right side. We cannot change this order using the parentheses, as parentheses are invalid characters in Liquid and will break our code.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">contains</strong> is the final operator on our list. This particular operator works differently than the previous ones as it does not check whether a comparing value is equal to a compared-to value. Instead, it allows us to check whether a string contains a substring:<p class="source-code">{% if collection.title <strong class="bold">contains</strong> "Christmas" %}</p><p class="source-code">  Our Christmas collection is stocked and ready to go!</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p><p>In the previous block of code, we check whether <strong class="source-inline">collection.title</strong>, which returns a string, contains the word <strong class="source-inline">"Christmas"</strong>, and if it does, it shows the message. Note that <strong class="source-inline">contains</strong> is case-sensitive and will only return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> if the sub-string strictly matches the part of the string.</p><p class="callout-heading">Important note:</p><p class="callout">We can use <strong class="source-inline">contains</strong> to search for the presence of a substring inside a string or even to check whether our string is a part of the array of strings. However, we cannot use it to check for the presence of an object inside the array of objects. We can only use <strong class="source-inline">contains</strong> to search for the presence of strings.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We have learned a lot <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>about using logical and comparison operators. However, we only learned how to compare one value against another known value. <em class="italic">So how would we check if a compared value, for example a collection description, exists?</em> Since <strong class="source-inline">collection.description</strong> returns content with which we are unfamiliar, we have no way of performing this check with our current knowledge. To perform this action, we would first need to learn the different types of data we can use with Liquid. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Understand the types of data</h1>
			<p>So far, we have mentioned two data types, <strong class="bold">strings</strong> and <strong class="bold">numbers</strong> to be precise. However, in Liquid, there <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>are six different types of data that are available to us:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Strings</li>
				<li>Number</li>
				<li>Boolean</li>
				<li>Nil</li>
				<li>Array</li>
				<li>EmptyDrop</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Strings</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">string</strong> is a type of data <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>that we use to represent text. Since a string can be any combination of letters, numbers, or special <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>characters, we should always encapsulate it with quotation marks:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% if product.title contains <strong class="bold">"Book"</strong> or product.title  contains <strong class="bold">"2021"</strong> %}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  We have found a product that contains the word Book or    the product that contains the word 2021.</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p>
			<p>In the previous example, we check whether the product title contains the string <strong class="source-inline">"Book"</strong> or the same product title contains the string <strong class="source-inline">"2021"</strong>, and if it does, our message will be shown.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Number</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">number</strong> is a type of data that require no <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>quotation marks, and we use it to represent the following two types of <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>numerical data:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">float</strong> is a floating-point number, meaning <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>that the number contains a decimal point.</li>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">integer</strong> or <strong class="bold">int</strong>, on the other hand, is a whole <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>number without a decimal point:<p class="source-code">{% if product.price &gt; <strong class="bold">25</strong> and product.price &lt; <strong class="bold">3500</strong> %}</p><p class="source-code">  The number of products in a collection is greater    than 25, and the product's price is lower than 3500.</p><p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this example, we check whether the product price is greater than <strong class="source-inline">25</strong>, and at the same time, lower than <strong class="bold">3500</strong>. If both conditionals are true, the message will be shown. Remember that since we used the <strong class="source-inline">and</strong> comparator, both conditionals must be true. If either one of them returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, our message will not be shown.</p>
			<p>Notice that neither of our two comparing values, <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> or <strong class="bold">3500</strong>, are encapsulated inside the quotation marks. Otherwise, they would become strings, which, as we remember, we cannot compare against the whole number that <strong class="source-inline">product.price</strong> will return.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Boolean</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Boolean</strong> is a type of <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>data that can either be <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% if customer.accepts_marketing == <strong class="bold">true</strong> %}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  The customer has signed up for our newsletter!</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p>
			<p>As we can see from <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>the example, similar to the number data type, Booleans do not use quotation marks. If <strong class="source-inline">customer.accepts_marketing</strong> has signed up for our newsletter, the object will be true, and our message will be visible.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Nil</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Nil</strong> is a data type that returns an empty value <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>when our code has no results. Since nil does not return any <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>values, we can use it to check for the truthfulness of a statement. However, we should note that we can only use nil to check whether the value exists. We cannot use nil to check the content of the value:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% if customer %}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  Welcome {{ customer.name }}!</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p>
			<p>In the previous example, we check whether the customer visiting our store has an account on our store using the conditional to perform the check if the customer object exists. Note that we have not added any operator or data type after our customer object. The reason for this is that nil is a special empty value. It is not a string with text <strong class="source-inline">nil</strong> or a variable and, as such, does not require any visual representation.</p>
			<p>We can split the values inside Liquid into two categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All data types that are true by default when used inside a conditional are considered <strong class="bold">truthy</strong>. Note that even empty values, such as strings, are considered truthy by default.</li>
				<li>On the other hand, all data types that return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> are considered <strong class="bold">falsy</strong>. The only two values that return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> by default are false and nil.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Since nil is considered falsy, our message will not show unless the customer has an account in our store. Otherwise, the conditional will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, and our message will show.</p>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>nil is extremely useful, it does not provide an answer to all of our questions. If we recall, in one of <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>our previous examples, we used <strong class="source-inline">collection.description</strong> to see the content of our description collection:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Our collection description is {{ collection.description }}.</p>
			<p>If our collection description has some defined content, our message will show correctly. However, if we have not defined a description for our collection, then <strong class="source-inline">collection.description</strong> will return empty, and we would end up with an incomplete message:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Out collection description is.</p>
			<p>As we recall, we can only use nil to check whether an element such as an object exists. It cannot check its content, <em class="italic">but what exactly does that mean?</em></p>
			<p class="source-code">{% if collection.description %}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;h3&gt;{{ collection.description }}&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p>
			<p>In this example, we have wrapped our element within a conditional using the nil data type to check whether a <strong class="source-inline">collection.description</strong> instance exists. However, as we can see, this is not the result that we hoped for:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
			<p>Since nil only checks whether an element exists, in our case, our conditional has found that <strong class="source-inline">collection.description</strong>, while empty, does exist. Remember that all values inside Liquid except false and nil are by default truthy, meaning that even empty strings are considered truthy. For this reason, even though our <strong class="source-inline">collection.description</strong> instance was empty and returned an empty string (since we used nil inside a conditional), the result was that the value was truthy. Therefore, the code inside the conditional is visible.</p>
			<p>To resolve this problem, instead of checking whether the value exists, we should check whether our value is not blank:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% if collection.description != blank %}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;h3&gt;The collection description element will show only if    its content is not empty.&lt;h3&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p>
			<p>In the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> example, we check to see whether our collection description is not empty using the not <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>equal parameter against <strong class="source-inline">blank</strong>. If the result of this conditional is that <strong class="source-inline">collection.description</strong> is not blank, the message we have defined will show. Otherwise, the conditional will return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> and the message defined inside the conditional will not render.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Array</h2>
			<p>An <strong class="bold">array</strong> is a data structure <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>that contains a list of elements, usually of the same type. Note that we cannot <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>initialize our array using Liquid only, but we can break down a string into an array of substrings, the data in which we can access using one of these two methods:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first option for accessing data inside an array is by directly accessing each item individually.<p>Since, as we mentioned, we cannot initialize an array using Liquid only, for this example, we can use <strong class="source-inline">product.tags</strong>, which would return an array of strings:</p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">"learning", "with", "packt", "is", "awesome!"</strong></p><p>To access these strings inside this string, we can use a square bracket annotation <strong class="source-inline">[]</strong> combined with <strong class="source-inline">product.tags</strong> and the index position to access each item individually:</p><p class="source-code">&lt;p&gt;{{ product.tags[0] }}&lt;/p&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;p&gt;{{ product.tags[1] }}&lt;/p&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;p&gt;{{ product.tags[2] }}&lt;/p&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;p&gt;{{ product.tags[3] }}&lt;/p&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;p&gt;{{ product.tags[4] }}&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>Note that array indexing starts at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, so we use <strong class="source-inline">product.tags[0]</strong> to access the first element <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>in our array. After submitting our code to the Liquid server, we<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> receive the following list of strings:</p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;learning&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;with&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;packt&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;is&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;awesome!&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p>While this method produces results, it is only applicable when we are entirely aware of the content of our array and the exact position of the element that we require. If, on the other hand, we are looking to output the entire content of an array without too much writing, we would need to use a different method.</p></li>
				<li>To access all items inside an array, we would need to loop through each item in our array and output their contents:<p class="source-code">{% for tag in product.tags %}</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;p&gt;{{ tag }}&lt;/p&gt;</p><p class="source-code">{% endfor %}</p><p>We can use the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> tag to repeatedly execute a block of code or to go over all of the values inside an array and output them:</p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;learning&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;with&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;packt&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;is&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">&lt;p&gt;awesome!&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p><p>As we can see, the results of running our <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop are precisely the same as when we previously accessed each item individually.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While it is easier to use the loop over an array to quickly output an array than to call out each item inside an array individually, it is essential to be aware of both methods, which will allow us to create some complex functionalities later on.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>EmptyDrop</h2>
			<p>The final data <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>type in our list is <strong class="bold">EmptyDrop</strong>, which would result from us trying to access an attribute of the <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>previously deleted object or disabled by using its handle.</p>
			<p>Before we learn about the final data type, we will first need to learn what a handle is, and how to find it.</p>
			<h3>Finding the handle</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">handle</strong> is a page title written in lowercase, where hyphens (<strong class="source-inline">-</strong>) are used to replace any special characters and spaces. Similar to when we learned how to access an individual item inside <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>an array using the position index, we can use page handles to access the attributes of a Liquid object. </p>
			<p>We now understand what a page handle is, but let's try to put that into context by creating a page on our store and see what we just learned in action:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To create a new page, we will first need to navigate to our store by visiting <a href="https://www.my-store-name.myshopify.com/admin">https://www.my-store-name.myshopify.com/admin</a> and logging in using our Shopify Partner credentials. An alternative way to do this is to visit the Shopify Partners site at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners">https://www.shopify.com/partners</a> and log in with the Partner account that we created in the previous chapter, subsequently clicking on the <strong class="bold">Store</strong> button in the left sidebar and then logging in to our store by clicking the <strong class="bold">Log in</strong> button next to the name of our store.</li>
				<li>After successfully logging in to our store, in the sidebar, under <strong class="bold">Sales channels</strong>, click on <strong class="bold">Online Store</strong> to expand the additional sections of the menu and subsequently click on the <strong class="bold">Pages</strong> link, redirecting us to the <strong class="bold">Pages</strong> section of our store:<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.1_B17606.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Accessing the Pages section&#13;&#10;" width="674" height="526"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Accessing the Pages section</p></li>
				<li>Once inside, since our store is new and has no content, the only thing that we will see is the <strong class="bold">Add page</strong> button. Otherwise, we would see a list of all the pages that we have access to in <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>our store. To proceed with creating our first page, click on the <strong class="bold">Add page</strong> button.</li>
				<li>After initializing the process of creating a new page, we will see the page where we can define the content of the new page, including the name, description, visibility, and which template the page should use. We will only need to enter the title of our page for our current purpose, ensuring that we select the <strong class="bold">Visible</strong> option under the <strong class="bold">Visibility</strong> section, where the <strong class="bold">Content</strong> field can remain empty for now. For our page, we have entered <strong class="source-inline">Learning about the page handle</strong> as the title. We also made sure to select the <strong class="bold">Visible</strong> option, so the only thing left is to click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button:<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.2_B17606.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Creating and publishing the new page in the Shopify admin interface&#13;&#10;" width="972" height="709"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Creating and publishing the new page in the Shopify admin interface</p></li>
				<li>Now that we have created <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>our page, we can see the page handle by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Edit website SEO</strong> button on the lower part of the window, which will expand and reveal the SEO information for our page, where, among other options, we can see the handle of our page:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.3_B17606.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Updating the page URL and handle information&#13;&#10;" width="641" height="507"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Updating the page URL and handle information</p>
			<p>As we recall, the handle is <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>a page title in lowercase with hyphens (<strong class="source-inline">-</strong>) replacing the special characters and empty spaces. In our case, the handle for our page is <strong class="source-inline">learning-about-the-page-handle</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note:</p>
			<p class="callout">If for some reason, we were to change the title of the page that we have now created, this would only affect the page title. The handle would remain the same, as changing the page name does not automatically update the handle. The only way to change the handle is to click on <strong class="bold">Edit website SEO</strong> and manually edit the handle inside the <strong class="bold">URL and handle</strong> field.</p>
			<p>Now that we have learned what the page handle is and how to manage it, we can proceed from where we left off with the EmptyDrop data type.</p>
			<h3>EmptyDrop data type</h3>
			<p>As we recall, EmptyDrop results from us trying to access an attribute of the previously deleted or disabled <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>object. Note that EmptyDrop, like nil, is not a string with the <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>text <strong class="source-inline">EmptyDrop</strong>, nor a variable, and as such, it does not have a visual representation.</p>
			<p>We can access an object using its handle by pluralizing the name of the object that we are trying to access, followed by either a squared bracket (<strong class="source-inline">[]</strong>) or dot (<strong class="source-inline">.</strong>) notation:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;{{ pages.<strong class="bold">learning-about-the-page-handle</strong>.title }}&lt;/h1&gt; \</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;{{ pages["<strong class="bold">learning-about-the-page-handle</strong>"].title}}&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p>While the result will be the same no matter which notation we select, it is important to mention both, as they each have their purpose, which we will cover in the later chapters:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;Learning about the page handle&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;Learning about the page handle&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p>We have now learned how to access an object and read its attributes through the page handle. However, <em class="italic">what if we were to go back to our admin interface and disable the previously created page by switching the Visibility option to Hidden?</em> The result of such an action would be EmptyDrop:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
			<p>EmptyDrop attributes have only one attribute called <strong class="source-inline">empty?</strong>, which is always truthy. To avoid this issue, we can create a conditional statement to check whether EmptyDrop is <strong class="source-inline">empty</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% if pages["learning-about-the-page-handle"].title !=  <strong class="bold">empty</strong> %}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;div class="tester"&gt;{{ pages["learning-about-the-page-     handle"].title }}&lt;/div&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p>
			<p>If the object is not <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>equal to empty, which is always truthy for EmptyDrop, the code inside <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>our conditional will render. Otherwise, if the code is equal to empty, the object we are looking for is empty, and the code will not render.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Controlling whitespace</h1>
			<p>In the previous sections, we learned how to use conditionals with variable data types to ensure that we always <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>receive a correct value. However, even with our conditionals, the same values can be accompanied by some unwanted whitespaces:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Collection info:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% if collection %}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  The collection's name is {{ collection.title }} !</p>
			<p class="source-code">{% endif %}</p>
			<p>In the previous example, we have created a conditional that will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> if our collection object exists, ensuring that our message will not be incomplete. While our result looks correct, if we were to inspect the page, we would see that things aren't perfect:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Collection info:</p>
			<p class="source-code">  The collection's name is Winter Shoes !</p>
			<p>As we can see from our previous example, we have successfully recovered the collection information. However, we can see a significant number of empty spaces around our message, which results from processing Liquid code. Even though not every Liquid code will output HTML, each line will generate a line for each line of Liquid code by default.</p>
			<p>To resolve this problem, we can introduce a hyphen inside our syntax tag as <strong class="source-inline">{{- - }}</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">{%- -%}</strong>, which allows us to strip any unwanted whitespace:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Collection info:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{%<strong class="bold">-</strong> if collection <strong class="bold">-</strong>%}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  The collection's name is {{ collection.title <strong class="bold">-</strong>}} !</p>
			<p class="source-code">{%<strong class="bold">-</strong> endif <strong class="bold">-</strong>%}</p>
			<p>With the introduction <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>of the hyphens seen in the previous code block, we have successfully removed the two empty lines that our conditional was rendering:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Collection info:</p>
			<p class="source-code">The collection's name is Winter Shoes!</p>
			<p>Notice how the hyphens we added on both ends within our conditional has removed the whitespace on both sides. However, we have only added one hyphen on the closing bracket of the <strong class="source-inline">collection.title</strong> to remove the empty whitespace on its right side. If we were to add a hyphen to the left side as well, we would have removed the space separating the verb <strong class="source-inline">"is"</strong> and the collection name.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered the basics of Liquid by learning what Liquid is, and how to discern Liquid code by learning how to read and write its syntax. We have gained an understanding of all Liquid logic and comparison operators, which, combined with all Liquid data types we have covered, will help us ensure that we always receive only the data we are expecting. As we progress further, this will become more and more essential. </p>
			<p>Lastly, we have learned how to create and access each page individually, which will be of great use to us in the following chapter, where we will be learning more about the objects that we have mentioned on a few occasions throughout the current chapter.</p>
