- en: The Internet is arguably one of the most profound achievements in human history.
    It has become so pervasive in our lives that we hardly even notice it—except when
    it happens to be unavailable! It’s one of those things that make you sit back
    and wonder how people got along without it in the *old days*. Without the ability
    to surf the Internet to order groceries, do our banking, book flights and make
    travel arrangements, meet friends, meet partners, download music and videos, study,
    run businesses, trade shares, run campaigns, express views, share ideas, learn
    about other people… where would we be?

- en: Fundamentally, in a world of so many people, where the sheer vastness of our
    societies is a hindrance to communication, the Internet has stepped up to the
    plate and brought everyone that little bit closer together. Utilizing a stunning
    array of technologies, spread out over the entire globe, the Internet has simply
    dropped the barriers of time and geographical distance to turn the entire world
    into a local community center.

- en: Lately, the all-encompassing focus of commerce on the Internet has begun to
    shift slightly. Millions upon millions of people are waking up to the possibility
    of sharing their lives and experiences with others through the medium of weblogs
    (blogs for short). Others simply want an online presence to show off their work,
    art, or music. Still others have important causes and need the Internet to disseminate
    information or provide a meeting point for like-minded people. Whatever the demands,
    the Internet has to find a way to efficiently meet these needs or face being superseded
    by something else in the future.

    it is they want without having to pour intellectual resources into understanding
    the technologies on which the Internet is based. What the Internet has got is
    precisely this—Drupal!

    a fully-fledged, customizable, and interactive website in several languages, with
    tens of thousands of users all over the world. Assuming you fall somewhere between
    these two extremes, this book is what you need to guide you on your way.

    and administrator.

- en: '*Chapter 1* introduces you to the world of Drupal and looks at where Drupal
    comes from, where it’s going, and what it can offer you. Because it is important
    to understand the nature of the tasks that lie ahead, it also discusses how to
    plan and build your website, taking a sneak preview of the book’s demo website
    in the process. Finally, we scrutinize the Drupal community and learn how to make
    the most of Drupal as an organized, living entity and not just a piece of software.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Setting Up the Development Environment")
    deals with how to get everything you need up and running on a development machine
    and also briefly looks at how all the requisite technologies gel together to produce
    your working Drupal site. Once everything is up and running, and after looking
    over some of the more common installation problems, the chapter presents a short
    tour of Drupal in order to give you an idea of what to expect.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Basics I: Site Configuration") looks at the
    most general settings that all Drupal administrators need to contend with. Everything
    from determining your site’s name to dealing with the cache or file system settings
    gets treated here before we look at more focused and complex issues in the chapters
    to come.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Basics II: Adding Functionality") sees us
    adding functionality to the newly created site. The focus of this chapter is really
    on modules and how they can be added and enabled, and also how to obtain modules
    that are not part of the standard distribution. This chapter ends off with a discussion
    on how to control blocks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Users, Roles, and Permissions") concerns
    itself with the topic of access control. Drupal has a sophisticated role-based
    access control system, which is fundamentally important for controlling how users
    access your site. This chapter will give you the information you need to implement
    whatever access controls you require.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Basic Content") gets to the heart of the
    matter by beginning the book’s coverage on content. Working with content, what
    content types are available, administering content, and even a discourse on some
    of the more common content-related modules serve as a basis for moving to more
    advanced content-related matters that follow in the next chapter.'

    it comes to creating engaging and dynamic content. While this chapter doesn’t
    require you to be an expert in HTML, PHP, and CSS, it does introduce you to the
    basics and shows how, with a little knowledge, extremely powerful and professional
    content can be created. That’s only half the story, because later on it looks
    at categorization and how this particular feature of Drupal sets it apart from
    everything else out there.'

    of how attractive interfaces are created in Drupal through the use of themes.
    As well as discussing briefly some of the considerations that must be taken into
    account when planning your website, it ends off by looking at how to make important
    modifications to your chosen theme.'

    adds the icing on the cake by looking at a host of more advanced topics. From
    creating flexible content types and generating revenue from ads, all the way through
    to building dynamic content using AJAX, you will find something to enhance your
    website and add that something special.'

    look at the types of tasks you will need to be proficient in so as to successfully
    run and maintain a Drupal site. Whether it’s setting up cron jobs or making backups
    of your database, everything you need to do throughout the course of running your
    newly created website will be covered here.'

    finished product and making it available for public consumption on your host site.'
