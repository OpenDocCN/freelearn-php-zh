			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Chapter 3</em>: Getting Started with Pimcore Admin UI</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will examine all the components and menus of the Pimcore administration interface, the "control room" from which you can do most of the operations necessary for the management of your website. By reading this book, you will be able to build a site from scratch. </p>
			<p>For getting your website completed, Pimcore allows you to create bundles, modify core components, or overwrite most of the parts that make it up (from controllers to models, from views to routing rules, and so on). All of these aspects will be explored later in the book, but you cannot tackle these topics without first learning how to move through the web interface as a user.</p>
			<p>In particular, in this chapter, we will discover the most useful tools to configure your site and where to find them on the administration page.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the Pimcore Architecture</li>
				<li>Exploring the UI Components</li>
				<li>Working with the grid component</li>
				<li>Inspecting the menus</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So let's get started with a brief introduction to the Pimcore architecture.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow the lessons in this chapter, you do not need more than a running Pimcore instance. You can just read through the chapter, but if you want to practice, you can open Pimcore and follow along.</p>
			<p>All you need to do here is just follow the instructions in <a href="B17073_02_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Setting Up Your Pimcore Development Environment</em>, for installing an empty Pimcore instance. </p>
			<p>Once this is done, can just open your browser and type http://localhost and navigate around the UI.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Understanding the Pimcore Architecture</h1>
			<p>In this short section, we will look at a simplified outline of the Pimcore architecture, with particular <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>attention paid to that part of the architecture that we will focus on in our discussion as we go through this chapter.</p>
			<p>In the following diagram, we can take a look at the Pimcore architecture, and understand which part of Pimcore we will be focusing on in this chapter:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.01_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1: Pimcore Architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1: Pimcore Architecture</p>
			<p>As you can see in the previous diagram, the starting point for our journey of discovering Pimcore is indicated by the dashed rectangle that contains the text: <strong class="bold">YOU ARE HERE</strong>.</p>
			<p>Just to get an idea of how Pimcore is composed in all its parts, let's look at each aspect of the diagram; even if what we see is a simplified version of the Pimcore architecture, we can identify all the important parts of the platform. We won't go into detail on each part, but we can still describe them quickly. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">PIMCORE UI LAYER</strong> is the user interface layer, that is, the entry point for all interactions with the users. Inside we can identify two further aspects, the <strong class="bold">ADMIN UI</strong> and the <strong class="bold">PUBLIC UI</strong>: this division between public and private is necessary to keep the services related to the administration, usable only by users with administration roles, decoupled from public ones that all users can use.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">APIs</strong> refers to the layer through which third-party software can access the Pimcore, interacting with <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>its features and data; the possibilities of the iteration are many, such as importing data, updating data, exporting data, creating content, and so on. Access to all these operations within this layer is possible using communication protocols, such as a REST API or GraphQL, which expose their services in this part of Pimcore. </p>
			<p>Finally, <strong class="bold">PIMCORE CORE ARCHITECTURE</strong> is the layer containing the business logic layer, the data models, the data access layer for database access, the templating engine for creating HTML pages – in other words, this is the core of Pimcore. Within the book, we will refer to this part as <strong class="bold">Pimcore admin</strong>, or the <strong class="bold">Admin Page</strong>, or even the <strong class="bold">Pimcore Dashboard</strong> in some cases.</p>
			<p>Let's begin our journey through the administration of Pimcore, starting from the UI components.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Exploring the UI Components</h1>
			<p>Pimcore is a <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>huge environment, supported by an equally important and extensive framework (Symfony), and this can be a bit confusing, especially for those new to Pimcore. But like all long journeys, we have to start with one step. Here's our first one. Let's log into the administration panel.</p>
			<p>First of all, we need to access the Pimcore administration; to do this, we must log in to the administration page by visiting the page <a href="http://www.yoursite.com/admin/">yoursite.com/admin/</a>. Here is the first screen we are <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>faced with, and we are welcomed by the Pimconaut, the Pimcore mascot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.02_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2: Pimcore Administration Login Page (the image on this page changes from time to time)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2: Pimcore Administration Login Page (the image on this page changes from time to time)</p>
			<p>Once logged in, we will be on the administration page, the Pimcore control room. In the next screenshot, we will see how the control room looks:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.03_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Pimcore administration&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Pimcore administration</p>
			<p>As we can see, the Pimcore <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>dashboard is divided into four parts that will be discussed in this section:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sidebar Menu </li>
				<li>Left Sidebar </li>
				<li>Main frame</li>
				<li>Right Sidebar</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's take a look at each one now.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Sidebar Menu</h2>
			<p>The sidebar menu <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>is the leftmost black bar you see. It <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>contains two parts: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first part at the top contains all the actions necessary for the development and configuration of the platform, from languages to routing rules, and research to creating objects. </li>
				<li>The second part, at the bottom, contains information about the system and user, notifications, and the Pimcore logo.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Just above the lower section of the sidebar, the Symfony logo is visible. Symfony is the PHP framework on which Pimcore was developed; its engine in other words. Everything done on Pimcore goes through this framework. When you click on the Symfony logo, another thin toolbar appears at the bottom of the page, as can be seen in this screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.04_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4: Symfony Toolbar&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4: Symfony Toolbar</p>
			<p>This new menu <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>contains some basic information about the system, such as memory usage, current user, Cache usage, or Database queries. Moving the <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>mouse over it, some pop-up windows will appear with additional information, as shown in this next screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.05_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5: Symfony toolbar and additional details&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5: Symfony toolbar and additional details</p>
			<p>When clicking on the items, a new page is loaded that contains more detailed information about each part of the system. If you need to have even more information than this about the system, you can click on one of the toolbar entries and a page will open where there is much more information about caches, logs, events, routines, and all the other parts of Symfony used by Pimcore.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Left sidebar</h2>
			<p>Always on the left, next to the menu sidebar, there is a second sidebar; this one contains <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>shortcuts to documents, assets, and data objects. We will <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>discuss them later in the following chapters, but they are the most common functionalities that we will use in creating beautiful Pimcore websites. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Main frame</h2>
			<p>The main frame is <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>the central panel of the Pimcore admin interface. All elements that need to be changed are loaded here. In other words, this is the place <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>where things related to the menu items are opened. The following is a screenshot of the main frame in action:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.06_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6: Pimcore administration with some tabs opened&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6: Pimcore administration with some tabs opened</p>
			<p>As you can see in the previous screenshot, there are some documents opened, each in a separate tab. The main frame is, in other words, the container of all the configuration windows that will be open during our work on Pimcore.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Right sidebar</h2>
			<p>The sidebar on the right of the main frame is a place where you can move components of the left sidebar. This can be done easily by clicking on the arrow (see <em class="italic">Figure 3.3</em>). This layout is <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>useful when you have to handle many items at once <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>and you want to keep them under control. For example, you may want to navigate the pages and, at the same time, have the products ready to be used on the page. So you may use the right toolbar for showing data objects. We will learn how we can model product entities using data objects in <a href="B17073_05_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Exploring Objects and Classes</em>.</p>
			<p>Pimcore allows changing the sidebar configuration, including by adding menu items, which is often useful for quick access to specific features. In the case of e-commerce, for example, it might be useful to have shortcuts available for orders or customers. An example of these customization capabilities can be seen in the demo examples on the official Pimcore site: <a href="https://demo.pimcore.fun/admin/">https://demo.pimcore.fun/admin/</a>. </p>
			<p>After this brief introduction about menus, we can see in detail all the elements we have just listed, starting from the main component of the Pimcore dashboard, the main frame. Any object <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>opened from the sidebar (or the menu entries) is opened inside the main frame as a new tab. In other words, the main frame is a <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>container for all the editing tabs, which the user can close one by one or all together just as you usually do with a browser. </p>
			<p>Now that we're familiar with the UI components, we can go a little further, and start analyzing the other parts in detail, such as the grid component and menus. In the next section, we will move on to take a look at the grid component, where we will spend most of our time when working with Pimcore data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Working with the grid component</h1>
			<p>In this session, we will analyze in detail how the grid component works. We will discover how to perform <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>simple activities such as searches. Moreover, we will also understand what each of the functionalities of the main buttons present on the toolbar is.</p>
			<p>First of all, let's take a look at the following screenshot, and see what the grid looks like during use:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.07_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7: Grid component&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7: Grid component</p>
			<p>As we can see from the preceding screenshot, there are at least four points of interest in this component:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The first tab bar with the opened entity, already seen before</li>
				<li>The toolbar with buttons for the main actions</li>
				<li>The second tab bar for a specific document</li>
				<li>The opened document</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We have listed <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>the elements that make up the grid component seen in <em class="italic">Figure 3.7</em>, so now we can describe them in more detail, starting from the first.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>First tab bar </h2>
			<p>This first element <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>we have already seen and it does not need further explanation; you can refer back to the <em class="italic">Main frame</em> section if required.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Toolbar</h2>
			<p>Now let's see the toolbar, along with some of its action buttons. </p>
			<p>Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>the type of object we are modifying, and in some cases depending on the publishing state of the document itself, it is possible to have different buttons in this toolbar. In other words, the toolbar changes based on the element you are editing (that is, a document or object) and on its publishing status. For example, if we are editing a web page, depending on whether it is published or yet to be published, we will see the <strong class="bold">SAVE</strong> and <strong class="bold">SAVE &amp; PUBLISH</strong> buttons or the <strong class="bold">SAVE &amp; PUBLISH</strong> and <strong class="bold">Unpublish</strong> buttons.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows a toolbar for different objects – for a folder, a web page, and then an object in a different state: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.08_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8: Toolbars displayed when editing folders, web page, and an object in a different state &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8: Toolbars displayed when editing folders, web page, and an object in a different state </p>
			<p>As you can see <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>in the previous screenshot, there are different numbers of buttons in the top toolbar – this is because the actions change dynamically depending on the type of object we are editing. </p>
			<p>For example, the <strong class="bold">SAVE &amp; PUBLISH</strong> button is always present in all elements that must be made visible, such as web pages or objects. For other elements of internal use, such as folders, it is not visible because it is not necessary.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 3.8</em>, you can see some buttons inside a red rectangle. These three buttons, always present in the toolbar, are as follows (from left to right):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reload</strong>: Reloads the document (not the whole page).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Show in tree</strong>: When you click this button, Pimcore identifies and selects the current object in the tree file on the left.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Info</strong>: This button opens a modal window with some information about the document we are editing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have seen the second element of the grid component, let's move to the next section, and analyze the third element of the four we have listed: the second tab bar.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Second tab bar</h2>
			<p>There is another tab bar, below the toolbar, which contains a variable number of tabs, each of which will display a set of properties for the object we are editing. Also, in this case, as we have <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>just seen for the tab bar, the number and type of tabs change according to the object and its state when we are modifying it. </p>
			<p>Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>the element we are editing, whether it is a web page, an object, or a folder, the number of tabs changes along with their meanings. For example, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.8</em>, if we are editing a web page, we will have the <strong class="bold">SEO &amp; Settings</strong> and <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> tabs, while if we are editing an object, we can see the <strong class="bold">Properties</strong> tab.</p>
			<p>In both cases, there is the <strong class="bold">Versions</strong> tab; if we open this tab, the contents will be shown, as can be seen in this screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.09_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9: The Versions tab for an object&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9: The Versions tab for an object</p>
			<p>As we can see from this screenshot, the content of the <strong class="bold">Versions</strong> tab is exactly what we expected: all the information about the changes made to the object, the date when they were made, and <a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>who made them. By clicking on any version you can see how the document <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>was previously, and by selecting two (<em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + click) you can <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>see the differences between the two versions.</p>
			<p>With this section, we have also described the third element of our list, the second tab bar. We can move on to the fourth and final item on our list, the opened document.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>The opened document</h2>
			<p>This is the part where the content of the open tab is displayed. As you can imagine, it is the largest part <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>of the whole component, because it contains all the <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>properties and actions necessary to modify and configure the document.  </p>
			<p>For example, as we can see in <em class="italic">Figure 3.9</em>, the version tab divides this component into two parts: on the left, in a table, are displayed all the changes made to the document, while on the right, a preview of the selected changes is displayed.</p>
			<p>Each tab will therefore contain different layouts and properties based on the document and what we are editing.</p>
			<p>In this section, we have seen in detail the parts that make up the grid component, a fundamental tool for working with documents. The last part of this chapter is dedicated to the menus, which we are going to explore now. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Inspecting the menus</h1>
			<p>Now we will deal with the menus, which, as often happens, play a very important role due to the large <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>number of actions that we find inside. We cannot look at them in detail one by one, so we will limit ourselves to discussing the scope of each menu and what we can do with the items we find inside it. This is essential for getting moving inside the Pimcore interface and following the lesson that we will learn in the next chapters.</p>
			<p>All of the menus are shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.10_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.10: The Pimcore menus&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10: The Pimcore menus</p>
			<p>From left <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>to right, the menus are as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">File</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tools</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Marketing</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Settings</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Search</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Clicking on the menu items opens a configuration page in the main frame as a new tab. However, there are menu items that contain a submenu (identifiable by the arrow on the right after the item), which appears when the mouse is moved over the item.</p>
			<p>As we said, it is not possible to describe the functionality of each of the items in all menus, so let's now look at what the main commands we can find inside are.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>File</h2>
			<p>The file menu, as we <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>usually know, contains the actions to open <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>documents (of various kinds), close all open tabs, navigate the Pimcore site to read the official documentation, or show the Pimcore information modal. There is also the shortcut for the dashboard page, where we can find some graphs that display the number of changes made in the last period, or the list of the last modified elements. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Tools</h2>
			<p>In this menu, we can find <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>some useful tools for site management, such <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>as redirects, site language management or emails sent, and the ability to send test emails. In addition to this, there are other ancillary features, such as notes and a useful link to the database administration page. In this menu, there is also some information about the system, such as the cache status or the PHP version in use.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Marketing</h2>
			<p>This menu is dedicated <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>to marketing management, including <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>features for search engine optimization, statistical reports, the configuration for analysis tools such as Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics, tools that those of you who work in web marketing know the importance of for monitoring visits to your website.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Settings</h2>
			<p>In this menu, we find all the actions necessary for the configuration of our site. It is possible, for example, to create and modify document types, general properties of objects, but also to manage users and their roles, configure the system <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>in all its parts (time zone, default language,email settings, and so on), create static routes, and manage the cache or translations. </p>
			<p>As we could have guessed, this is one of the most important menus, but it is not necessary to remember exactly which items it contains, we just need to remember that here we can find most of the configurations that we will have to do on our site from an administrative point of view. With practice and experience, we will be able to memorize all the functionalities of the various menus, although now this may seem like a distant goal.</p>
			<p>Just to understand how many things can hide inside even just a menu item, here is the <strong class="bold">System Settings</strong> page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.11_B1073.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11: The System Settings page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11: The System Settings page</p>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>can see, each section can be expanded by clicking <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>on the <strong class="bold">+</strong> to access the configuration parameters of the section itself.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Search</h2>
			<p>Finally, in this last menu, you can find the shortcuts for the general search functionality, as well as <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>for the specific search function for certain elements of <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>the site such as assets, documents, and data objects.</p>
			<p>In this section, we have seen what each of the menus are and the many features available in Pimcore. It was not possible to describe them individually, but we still discussed the most important items in the book, and we will leave the fun of exploring all the menu items that we have not described to you.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>After reading this chapter, you now know how to move inside the Pimcore administration UI, where you can find the most important tools for Pimcore governance. We talked about the actions of the various menus, how to use the grid component, and what the main elements of the administration UI are. This is quite a large amount of information so far but it is essential for understanding what we will study in the next chapters. </p>
			<p>Now that we are aware of how to navigate the most important of Pimcore's functionalities, we can move on to the next step, which is learning how to create documents using Pimcore. </p>
