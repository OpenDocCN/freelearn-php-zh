    is. **Pimcore** is an open source, enterprise-grade **Digital eXperience Platform**
    (**DXP**) solution that aims to be the leader in its market segment. But what
    does this definition really mean? It sounds very vague as, too often in the IT
    world, buzzwords are used as filler when describing something. And that's why
    we have to explain what Pimcore is properly, not just telling you what it does
    but drilling down into the problems it solves.

    a CMS platform that will support our business or our customers' business for years
    to come. Learning about a tool such as Pimcore without fully understanding how
    it can be useful could be a waste of time, and you may lose a lot of technical

    We are no longer satisfied with a tool that only builds a website. That was okay
    10 years ago, but now, most companies have a more holistic approach to digital
    communication and want more. You don't have to be scared by this change; since
    the birth of the internet, we've seen many evolutions and things have become better
    and better. We simply have to follow the trends, or better, anticipate the trends.

    just producing static text content. It literally meant manually writing every
    single page and uploading it using a **File Transfer Protocol** (**FTP**) link,
    if you were lucky. We still remember when we were fighting with scripting languages
    to mix HTML, data, and Flash content just to render two or three pages for a simple
    website.

    the opportunity of letting the final user manage their data, reducing the development
    effort required. That was a revolution, and many CMS solutions spread across the
    web. WordPress, Drupal, and other products became a must for creating websites.

    of digital innovation is **DXP**. This acronym was coined by Gartner and is a
    way to describe a technical solution that can support the digital experience of
    a company. What a company should do, nowadays, is put the customer at the center
    of everything and use technology to power the delivery of the right content to
    the right person. Most of the companies that wanted to expand their business online
    started their digital transformations years ago. They created e-commerce sites
    to sell online and reached all their customers with the right products. They have
    had websites since the beginning of the internet (some have had more than one).
    Corporations can have a single global website, one per brand, or different websites
    based on the target market. They also have a portal, to give agents or third-party
    vendors access **Business-to-Business** (**B2B**) information.

    We can also see that websites and portals create web content using the same CMS.
    Based on your experience, you may already understand that these three solutions
    need to share some features. Replicating them in separate platforms is redundant,

    their system. This usually happens because, historically, these companies adopted
    many vertical solutions, and only later did they ask themselves how to integrate
    them. These isolated sets of data are called **silos**. A quick way to break down
    data silos is to create a central database with all the information that's needed
    and to facilitate delivery to the consumer through easy and transparent API protocols.
    This solution is called **Master Data Management** (**MDM**), and it's one of
    the features offered by Pimcore (we'll see this in [*Chapter 6*](B17073_06_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112),

    channels, we might need to print information on them in physical catalogs, and
    we cannot have different information in different places about the same thing.
    The centralization of product management is called **Product Information Management**

    later, but for now, keep in mind that growing companies have such needs.

    itself. The name suggests that the PIM is the main part, but you shouldn't be
    taken in by appearances. Pimcore is a lot more than a PIM product.

    need to implement our projects. This second definition is not much more intuitive
    to understand than the first, but it gives us an important hint. Pimcore is a
    set of tools, but we cannot think of it as a library or some snippets. Pimcore
    is a set of collaborative tools; each tool can solve its own problem. It is not
    a product but a suite of products. The combination of all of them helps to design
    a complete digital solution. In this sense, Pimcore is a true DXP: a platform
    that enables developers to implement digital projects. This definition is a little
    bit vague, but it tells us that Pimcore gives us a very wide range of opportunities.
    We cannot merely say "Pimcore does this or that" because Pimcore can do everything.'

    all of a company's information. Pimcore offers many features out of the box, such
    as DAM, PIM, MDM, and **Datahub**, in a single package. We have already had a
    brief overview of what DAM, PIM, and MDM are, but there will be time to go deeper

    Do you really need the overhead of managing a complex platform like Pimcore to
    build your simple website? There are much easier solutions on the market for implementing
    a website. You can find a super-cheap CMS hosting provider, or use a site builder.
    These solutions are probably good for small companies, but not for medium to large
    organizations. Enterprises need to do more, and in this first chapter, you will
    learn about the opportunities you would be missing by using a simple CMS solution
    to implement your website.
  prefs: []

    to manage all scenarios, from the simplest to the most complex. And you don't
    want to implement 10 different tools to satisfy all the needs of your marketing
    department. Moreover, you do not want to pay for the cost of continuous re-platforming
    as your business grows. The technical solution for building an application must
    be a boost, something that gives you more benefits than doing things from scratch,
    but also something that doesn't limit constant change. You need the option of
    customizing each part of a website without compromises such as adding thousands
    of plugins and slowly but steadily losing control of the solution.

    don't really need – that's understandable. Having a super-powered platform just
    to realize a simple website may seem like overkill. Sometimes it can be scary.
    Anyway, if you read the first section of this chapter again, you will agree that,
    sooner or later, you will need something more than a simple CMS and at that point,
    you will want to be able to scale without having to change your platform.

    layer from the data structure. Put simply, you have to add data on one side and
    then draw it from the other, without there being any dependency between the two
    layers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the detached model, the separation between the business logic and the presentation
    layer can be achieved by detaching the data generated from the rendering process.
    In Pimcore, we have a **Model View Controller** (**MVC**) model where the **Twig**
    templating engine cannot elaborate on business logic. For anyone who is not an
    expert on MVC and Twig, MVC is a pattern for separating business logic (controller)
    from presentation (view) and data (model), while Twig is a PHP template engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other option is to adopt a fully headless solution. In this case, we expose
    data using APIs and then render it with a modern **Single-Page Application** (**SPA**),
    such as a React website made static with Gatsby. This headless solution gives
    a strong separation between the various aspects (such as data definition and data
    presentation), and data exposed to the app can be used by other applications too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The market offers many headless CMS solutions, but Pimcore comes out of the
    box with both solutions, headless and detached. So, you can manage simple websites
    using a standard detached approach, and this lets you create templates as usual,
    but without any mutual dependency between presentation and business logic. This
    keeps the design simple, and you will benefit from the advantages of decoupling,
    so you can refresh your website with little effort just by reimplementing the
    template.

    In fact, it comes with an out-of-the-box solution for exposing data in GraphQL

    those unfamiliar with it, GraphQL is a query language for APIs that describes
    data and reduces friction between the data producers and consumers.

    (also known as **web portals**) and institutional websites. That led to a division
    between CMS websites and portal solutions. As these CMS websites and portals had
    different needs, we became used to adopting different tools and maybe different
    teams of suppliers for each.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, in the past, creating a public website was quite simple, so having
    a simple CMS solution was okay. On the other hand, creating a portal was more
    complex, so we needed a highly customizable solution. But with the spread of digital
    technology, more and more companies started selling online, adding this new requirement.
    So, what was the solution? The companies simply took a tool from the market, installed
    it, and started to sell. This was a quick way to solve the problem of selling
    online, but it caused an issue: it added a third platform (e-commerce) to the
    CMS and portal. This often meant a new supplier, a new graphic interface, and
    a different user experience. In other words, it meant a situation where three
    systems were in different realms in terms of data and user experience. After a
    few years of fighting with data flows, integrations, and the replication of business
    logic across these environments, one day, advisors such as Gartner came up with
    a solution. They told us we had silos in our organization, that silos were bad,
    and that we should remove them. Moreover, the same advisors told us that commerce,
    portals, and content management are not different needs, but are all part of the
    same digital experience. The question is: if all those components are what the
    user wants, who can provide us with a tool to deliver them?'

    and private websites, so you can create reserved areas and portals as well as
    simple one-page company websites. Moreover, this solution keeps a link to the

    the cloud is not always an option. We may have to deal with sensitive data that
    has to be kept secure in a private data center, or our budget may only allow a
    cheap hosting provider. Each company has different requirements, but they all

    feature aggregates any kind of data and distributes it across multiple channels.
    Compared to other solutions, Pimcore has the best data management system. It allows
    you to define data using the UI, and this is very good because you don't have
    to write a single line of code. You can stop messing about with database tables,
    field lengths, and data queries; all you need to do is simply open your browser,
    create your entities, and pick the fields you want. This feature is very similar
    to what can be found on low-code platforms or headless CMS, but with a boost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Most data management tools have, as their unique goal, the data model definition.
    Such a solution gives us the ability to quickly define a data model and APIs but
    produces a UI that''s hard to use for the regular user. Basically, you are very
    much limited to the standard data entry interface, so in most cases, you have
    to write a user UI from scratch. This is what the purely headless principle aims
    for: delegating all the rendering aspects outside the system. This is a good principle
    when designing an application for the final user (such as customers or portal
    users), but what if we need to allow an administrator or editor to enter content
    on our platform? For such internal users, Pimcore offers an administrative interface
    that can be customized when you define the data model.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, when you add a field to a collection of items, such as when
    adding an SKU field for a product entity, you don't just define how the data is
    stored (uniqueness, field length, type of date, and so on) but also how this field
    will be presented to the user. For example, you can group fields in tabs or panels,
    or simply reorder them to create a good user experience for back-office users,
    without touching a single line of code. Moreover, Pimcore supports multi-language,
    so you can select which field is translated just by modeling the fields. This
    feature transforms Pimcore into the perfect headless CMS because it combines the
    flexibility of an admin backend that's ready to go with the power of a data API
    for building custom applications.
  prefs: []

    a little bit lost, what with the thousands of features that the Pimcore admin
    interface offers. Just after a few minutes of playing with Pimcore, it will be
    clear what level of freedom you can reach with this tool. Thanks to the multi-tab
    environment, you can open multiple data tabs in the same window, easily cut and
    paste data from one place to another, and import\export data in seconds.

    made available by REST APIs; this is a native feature that doesn't require any

    Pimcore interface is available through a REST API without any additional effort
    (since PimcoreX this feature will be available only as an Enterprise Subscription
    feature). You can make an HTTP call to put a row into a database or query a list
    of entities without writing a single line of code.

    it combines all the tools for implementing e-commerce, and you can turn your website
    or portal into a complete DXP solution. It's an API-driven approach to make a
    platform integrable with every system, and it helps to break down silos.

    The rich **What You See Is What You Get** (**WYSIWYG**) interface shows content
    as it will appear when published. So, you can enter data and build pages without
    any doubt about what the final result will be. Furthermore, you can create page
    templates that will drive the user through an assisted page composition. This
    process asks the editor to write only the content that is relevant, without wasting
    time changing styles or text positioning.

    of data. What if you model a collection of items called "product" and you add
    a price inside the data model? Well, this makes Pimcore a PIM. This is not a joke.
    That is how simple working with Pimcore is. You can add a PIM to your company
    using your browser within a few minutes. After this 5-minute task, you have a
    unique database for all the products of your company. Thanks to the data integration
    capabilities of Pimcore, you can ingest data from any CSV files without writing
    any lines of code, or in any case, with very little effort. Job done.

    and managed centrally. Orders, customers, and probably tons of other data are

    you have to know where data is. But the problem is not related only to these few

    records (information that is central for a company). This ability is out of the
    box, free, and with limited effort. How? Just by defining the data model and integrating
    it with the data masters, such as the CRM, ERP, or whatever owns the entity you
    want to move. Then, you can define an access policy for data, implementing all
    the logic you want. This is not just cool...it is super cool! With one tool and
    a few minutes, you can be ready to expose important data to all the company applications
    you need. Such a solution enables you to dominate your data (this mission is often
    called data governance).

    chapter. The main benefits of Pimcore's MDM are that it can manage the structure,
    but also the validation, versioning, and enrichment of elements. In fact, most
    entities have different attributes based on their destination. To explain what
    the benefits of MDM are, we could use any entity, but we will talk again about
    products. This is just because it is the most common scenario and we can understand
    it best. When reading the next paragraph, you can replace the word "product" with
    any other kind of data without changing the meaning (orders, customers, invoices,
    and so on).

    we usually have an R&D team that works on a prototype, then somebody else approves
    it for market, and then we start selling it. Probably, in this flow, the first
    stage where we can talk about a concrete product is when the record enters the
    ERP, creating a product code. The product is owned by the ERP that manages product
    codes and prices. At this stage, you don't really need a lot more data. You have
    all that you need to produce a quote or an invoice. Furthermore, most technical
    solutions are not built to manage cool product information with multiple images
    and long descriptions. An ERP is a vertical solution and it does very well only
    with the set of things that are in its scope. It makes no sense to try to push
    it to do something different.
  prefs: []

- en: Well, what you need here is a data enrichment process. What normally happens,
    without a PIM or MDM, is that each user enhances data for what they need. So,
    you can have e-commerce that adds bigger images and long HTML descriptions, but
    that e-commerce provides information only for products sold in the **Business
    to Consumer** (**B2C**) channel. So, you have to do the same in the B2B portal
    for other products. That's why, in this example, a product is not managed centrally.
    Using Pimcore, products and any other entities can be translated and enriched
    with images, video, and attachments before being delivered to the consumer. This
    is the only way to dominate data and be able to put the bulk of your effort into
    the things that really matter to the company, such as implementing good applications
    instead of fighting with data.

- en: Just think about what an e-commerce solution entails. The first element to talk
    about is the budget. Not all e-commerce systems are like Amazon or eBay, so we
    need to find the right solution based on what we need, but also on how much we
    can pay. Developers that were active when the e-commerce market started came from
    an on-premises, highly customizable era where a vertical open source solution
    such as the Magento e-commerce system was the standard. That solution was good
    because it let you customize each part of the process, but you had to host things
    yourself, taking on all the related risks, and the customization element required
    continuous maintenance. Therefore, the **Total Cost of Ownership** (**TCO**) was
    very high, and many companies moved to **Software as a Service** (**SaaS**) solutions,
    which come with fewer customization options but are free from maintenance and
    hosting responsibilities. This reduction of friction made e-commerce more democratic,
    but in many cases reduced the opportunities for the personalization of e-commerce.
    For many companies, the uniqueness of their service and the automation of the
    company's processes are crucial for e-commerce solutions. We're speaking mostly
    about the big players, but also a lot of start-ups got their success by thinking
    outside the box. The only difference is that a big player can land a mega-vendor
    solution, where cost grows exponentially but you get results to match. What about
    normal companies with a limited budget?

    tools, selecting software, and then activating a project is too slow a process.
    Maybe it is the best process, theoretically speaking, but it requires a lot of
    time and often is not in keeping with the market's trends and speed. You should
    be one step ahead of the market, planning investments before you need them, but
    this is not always feasible. Nobody has a crystal ball. And planning and spending
    in advance is a risk because you don't know what the future holds.
