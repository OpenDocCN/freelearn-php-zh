    is. **Pimcore** is an open source, enterprise-grade **Digital eXperience Platform**
    (**DXP**) solution that aims to be the leader in its market segment. But what
    does this definition really mean? It sounds very vague as, too often in the IT
    world, buzzwords are used as filler when describing something. And that's why
    we have to explain what Pimcore is properly, not just telling you what it does
    but drilling down into the problems it solves.

    a CMS platform that will support our business or our customers' business for years

    We are no longer satisfied with a tool that only builds a website. That was okay
    10 years ago, but now, most companies have a more holistic approach to digital
    communication and want more. You don't have to be scared by this change; since

    just producing static text content. It literally meant manually writing every

    the opportunity of letting the final user manage their data, reducing the development

    of everything and use technology to power the delivery of the right content to
    the right person. Most of the companies that wanted to expand their business online
    started their digital transformations years ago. They created e-commerce sites
    to sell online and reached all their customers with the right products. They have
    had websites since the beginning of the internet (some have had more than one).
    Corporations can have a single global website, one per brand, or different websites
    based on the target market. They also have a portal, to give agents or third-party
    vendors access **Business-to-Business** (**B2B**) information.

    In Pimcore, we have a **Model View Controller** (**MVC**) model where the **Twig**
    templating engine cannot elaborate on business logic. For anyone who is not an
    expert on MVC and Twig, MVC is a pattern for separating business logic (controller)

    data using APIs and then render it with a modern **Single-Page Application** (**SPA**),
    such as a React website made static with Gatsby. This headless solution gives
    a strong separation between the various aspects (such as data definition and data
    presentation), and data exposed to the app can be used by other applications too.

- en: The market offers many headless CMS solutions, but Pimcore comes out of the
    box with both solutions, headless and detached. So, you can manage simple websites
    using a standard detached approach, and this lets you create templates as usual,
    but without any mutual dependency between presentation and business logic. This
    keeps the design simple, and you will benefit from the advantages of decoupling,

  zh: 在CMS时代的初期，交互式网站（也称为**门户网站**）和机构网站之间存在分歧。这导致了CMS网站和门户解决方案之间的分歧。由于这些CMS网站和门户网站有不同的需求，我们习惯了采用不同的工具，也许每个都需要不同的供应商团队。
- en: 'For example, in the past, creating a public website was quite simple, so having
    a simple CMS solution was okay. On the other hand, creating a portal was more
    complex, so we needed a highly customizable solution. But with the spread of digital
    technology, more and more companies started selling online, adding this new requirement.
    So, what was the solution? The companies simply took a tool from the market, installed
    it, and started to sell. This was a quick way to solve the problem of selling
    online, but it caused an issue: it added a third platform (e-commerce) to the
    CMS and portal. This often meant a new supplier, a new graphic interface, and
    a different user experience. In other words, it meant a situation where three
    systems were in different realms in terms of data and user experience. After a
    few years of fighting with data flows, integrations, and the replication of business
    logic across these environments, one day, advisors such as Gartner came up with
    a solution. They told us we had silos in our organization, that silos were bad,
    and that we should remove them. Moreover, the same advisors told us that commerce,
    portals, and content management are not different needs, but are all part of the
    same digital experience. The question is: if all those components are what the
    user wants, who can provide us with a tool to deliver them?'

- en: Data management is the root of all features in Pimcore. The data management
    feature aggregates any kind of data and distributes it across multiple channels.
    Compared to other solutions, Pimcore has the best data management system. It allows
    you to define data using the UI, and this is very good because you don't have
    to write a single line of code. You can stop messing about with database tables,
    field lengths, and data queries; all you need to do is simply open your browser,
    create your entities, and pick the fields you want. This feature is very similar
    to what can be found on low-code platforms or headless CMS, but with a boost.

  zh: 数据管理是Pimcore所有功能的根源。数据管理功能聚合任何类型的数据，并将其分发到多个渠道。与其他解决方案相比，Pimcore拥有最佳的数据管理系统。它允许你通过UI定义数据，这非常好，因为你不需要编写任何一行代码。你可以停止与数据库表、字段长度和数据查询的麻烦；你所需要做的就是简单地打开你的浏览器，创建你的实体，并选择你想要的字段。这个特性与低代码平台或无头CMS上可以找到的特性非常相似，但更加强大。
- en: 'Most data management tools have, as their unique goal, the data model definition.
    Such a solution gives us the ability to quickly define a data model and APIs but
    produces a UI that''s hard to use for the regular user. Basically, you are very
    much limited to the standard data entry interface, so in most cases, you have
    to write a user UI from scratch. This is what the purely headless principle aims
    for: delegating all the rendering aspects outside the system. This is a good principle
    when designing an application for the final user (such as customers or portal
    users), but what if we need to allow an administrator or editor to enter content
    on our platform? For such internal users, Pimcore offers an administrative interface
    that can be customized when you define the data model.'

  zh: 大多数数据管理工具的独特目标，是数据模型定义。这样的解决方案使我们能够快速定义数据模型和API，但产生的UI对普通用户来说很难使用。基本上，你非常受限，只能使用标准的数据录入界面，所以在大多数情况下，你必须从头开始编写用户UI。这正是纯无头原则所追求的：将所有渲染方面委托给系统之外。当为最终用户（如客户或门户用户）设计应用程序时，这是一个好原则，但如果我们需要允许管理员或编辑在我们平台上输入内容怎么办？对于这样的内部用户，Pimcore提供了一个可以在定义数据模型时定制的管理界面。
- en: In other words, when you add a field to a collection of items, such as when
    adding an SKU field for a product entity, you don't just define how the data is
    stored (uniqueness, field length, type of date, and so on) but also how this field
    will be presented to the user. For example, you can group fields in tabs or panels,
    or simply reorder them to create a good user experience for back-office users,
    without touching a single line of code. Moreover, Pimcore supports multi-language,
    so you can select which field is translated just by modeling the fields. This
    feature transforms Pimcore into the perfect headless CMS because it combines the
    flexibility of an admin backend that's ready to go with the power of a data API
    for building custom applications.

  zh: 换句话说，当你向项目集合添加一个字段，例如为产品实体添加SKU字段时，你不仅定义了数据的存储方式（唯一性、字段长度、日期类型等），还定义了该字段将如何展示给用户。例如，你可以将字段分组在标签页或面板中，或者简单地重新排序，为后台用户创造良好的用户体验，而不需要修改任何一行代码。此外，Pimcore支持多语言，因此你可以通过建模字段来选择哪些字段需要翻译。这个特性使Pimcore成为完美的无头CMS，因为它结合了现成的管理后端灵活性和构建自定义应用程序的数据API的强大功能。

    a little bit lost, what with the thousands of features that the Pimcore admin

    records (information that is central for a company). This ability is out of the
    box, free, and with limited effort. How? Just by defining the data model and integrating
    it with the data masters, such as the CRM, ERP, or whatever owns the entity you
    want to move. Then, you can define an access policy for data, implementing all
    the logic you want. This is not just cool...it is super cool! With one tool and
    a few minutes, you can be ready to expose important data to all the company applications

- en: This whole configuration is what we called MDM in the first section of this
    chapter. The main benefits of Pimcore's MDM are that it can manage the structure,
    but also the validation, versioning, and enrichment of elements. In fact, most
    entities have different attributes based on their destination. To explain what
    the benefits of MDM are, we could use any entity, but we will talk again about
    products. This is just because it is the most common scenario and we can understand
    it best. When reading the next paragraph, you can replace the word "product" with
    any other kind of data without changing the meaning (orders, customers, invoices,
    and so on).

- en: Think about a product. Where did it start? This is a hard question, because
    we usually have an R&D team that works on a prototype, then somebody else approves
    it for market, and then we start selling it. Probably, in this flow, the first
    stage where we can talk about a concrete product is when the record enters the
    ERP, creating a product code. The product is owned by the ERP that manages product
    codes and prices. At this stage, you don't really need a lot more data. You have
    all that you need to produce a quote or an invoice. Furthermore, most technical
    solutions are not built to manage cool product information with multiple images
    and long descriptions. An ERP is a vertical solution and it does very well only
    with the set of things that are in its scope. It makes no sense to try to push
    it to do something different.
  id: totrans-106

- en: Well, what you need here is a data enrichment process. What normally happens,
    without a PIM or MDM, is that each user enhances data for what they need. So,
    you can have e-commerce that adds bigger images and long HTML descriptions, but
    that e-commerce provides information only for products sold in the **Business
    to Consumer** (**B2C**) channel. So, you have to do the same in the B2B portal
    for other products. That's why, in this example, a product is not managed centrally.
    Using Pimcore, products and any other entities can be translated and enriched
    with images, video, and attachments before being delivered to the consumer. This
    is the only way to dominate data and be able to put the bulk of your effort into
    the things that really matter to the company, such as implementing good applications
    instead of fighting with data.

- en: Just think about what an e-commerce solution entails. The first element to talk
    about is the budget. Not all e-commerce systems are like Amazon or eBay, so we
    need to find the right solution based on what we need, but also on how much we
    can pay. Developers that were active when the e-commerce market started came from
    an on-premises, highly customizable era where a vertical open source solution
    such as the Magento e-commerce system was the standard. That solution was good
    because it let you customize each part of the process, but you had to host things
    yourself, taking on all the related risks, and the customization element required
    continuous maintenance. Therefore, the **Total Cost of Ownership** (**TCO**) was
    very high, and many companies moved to **Software as a Service** (**SaaS**) solutions,
    which come with fewer customization options but are free from maintenance and
    hosting responsibilities. This reduction of friction made e-commerce more democratic,
    but in many cases reduced the opportunities for the personalization of e-commerce.
    For many companies, the uniqueness of their service and the automation of the
    company's processes are crucial for e-commerce solutions. We're speaking mostly
    about the big players, but also a lot of start-ups got their success by thinking
    outside the box. The only difference is that a big player can land a mega-vendor
    solution, where cost grows exponentially but you get results to match. What about
    normal companies with a limited budget?

- en: In this scenario, Pimcore fills the gap between fully managed SaaS solutions
    and mega-vendors. In fact, Pimcore comes with an e-commerce framework that is
    designed to speed up e-commerce development but doesn't introduce constraints
    or limitations. In addition, using a stable cloud-based solution, you can reach
    your low-maintenance-cost target and sleep peacefully during Black Friday, when
    availability is crucial.

    and every company needs to keep up with the times. The only option is to be ready
    for change. This leads us to rapid innovation. In many cases, having vertical
    tools, selecting software, and then activating a project is too slow a process.
    Maybe it is the best process, theoretically speaking, but it requires a lot of
    time and often is not in keeping with the market's trends and speed. You should
    be one step ahead of the market, planning investments before you need them, but
    this is not always feasible. Nobody has a crystal ball. And planning and spending
    in advance is a risk because you don't know what the future holds.

    company that makes timing their priority. Pimcore helps companies to start with
    small projects and build their target solution step by step, reducing the risk

    of resources and time implementing data management is reduced because it is all

    a big advantage over an approach where you build entire custom software from scratch
    and you need to maintain it yourself. With an open source project, you are responsible
    only for maintaining your customizations, which usually constitute a small layer
    on top of the platform. If you create software from scratch instead, you are responsible
    for the maintenance of 100% of the code. Moreover, if you develop a module that
    could be useful for the community, you can share it open source and the community
    can benefit from it.

    Commercial License** (**PCL**).

    solutions offered by mega-vendors. You aren't limited to buying software, and
    you won't face any vendor lock-in. Moreover, if you don't want to use a GPL license,
    you can simply avoid it, keeping full ownership of your code. This is useful if
    you are going to create a product based on Pimcore and you want to keep your **Intellectual

    Data Syndication**, and so on). The Enterprise subscription gives access to the
    **Long Term Support** (**LTS**) and **Service-Level Agreements** (**SLAs**). In
