<p>his chapter will guide you through the process of setting up WordPress and customizing its essential features. You can choose between a couple of options regarding where your WordPress website will live. WordPress is a relatively small package of software (less than 10 MB) as well as being easy to install and administer.</p>
<p>Here's what's important:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress is available in easily downloadable formats at <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">https://wordpress.org/download/</a></li>
<li>WordPress is a free, open source application and is released under GNU <strong>General Public License</strong> (<strong>GPL</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that anyone who produces a modified version of the software is required to maintain the same freedom that the GPL provides, and then people buying or using the software can also modify and redistribute it. Thus, WordPress and other software released under the GPL are maintained as open source.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up WordPress on an external web host</li>
<li>Install WordPress manually—both on an external host and also locally for development and testing</li>
<li>Perform basic setup tasks in the WordPress admin panel (the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are your absolute WordPress fundamentals. Learning what's in this chapter will give you a good start in the world of WordPress.</p>

<p>The first decision you have to make is where your blog is going to live. You have two basic options when creating your site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either go to <a href="http://WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> and sign up for a free (or paid) website (that way, you get the website installed for you)</li>
<li>Or, go to WordPress.org and use the open-source version of WordPress—by installing it on your own server or a server of a third-party hosting firm</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of each of these two options.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This aspect of the WordPress ecosystem is a bit confusing, but there are basically two versions of WordPress available out there. To make this simpler, let me just use the website addresses where you can find them:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress.com (<a href="https://wordpress.com/">https://wordpress.com/</a>)</li>
<li>WordPress.org (<a href="https://wordpress.org/">https://wordpress.org/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, those two websites don't lead to the same place. In fact, they lead to two completely different places:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress.com is a commercial website-building solution. You can go there, sign up for an account, and then configure your website based on the available settings and designs.</li>
<li>WordPress.org is an open source website software. To use it, you first need to get access to a web server—either rent it out from a hosting company or set up a server on a local machine—and then you can install WordPress on it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">This book is purely about the WordPress software that can be obtained from WordPress.org. We do not cover WordPress.com much, since it is a commercial service that's not as versatile.</div>

<p>Even though WordPress.org is the topic of this book, there are still valid reasons why some users might be interested in WordPress.com. The main advantage of using WordPress.com (<a href="https://wordpress.com/">https://wordpress.com/</a>) is that, it's them who take care of all the technical details for you. You're not responsible for anything else but the management of your content. A major disadvantage is that you don't have full control over your website. The other advantages and disadvantages are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress.com will not let you upload or edit your own theme, though it will let you (for a fee) edit the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of the themes that are already there.</li>
<li>WordPress.com will not let you upload or manage plugins at all. Some plugins are installed by default (most notably Akismet, for spam blocking, and also plugins supporting Google Sitemaps, caching, carousel slideshows, image galleries, polls, site stats, and some social media buttons), but you can neither uninstall them nor install others. Additional features are available for a fee.</li>
<li>A major advantage of working with the software from WordPress.org is that <em>you have control over everything</em>. You can add and edit themes, add and remove plugins, and even edit the WordPress application files yourself if you wish to (however, don't do this unless you're confident about your WordPress skills).</li>
<li>The disadvantage of WordPress.org is that you'll have to keep the WordPress software up to date on your own, and in some cases install it by yourself as well, but that's relatively simple, and we'll cover it in this chapter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table is a brief overview of the essential differences between using WordPress.com versus downloading a package from WordPress.org and then installing it on your own server:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%" border="1">
<thead>

<td/>
<td><strong>WordPress.com (online platform/service)</strong></td>
<td><strong>WordPress.org (open source software)</strong></td>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Installation</strong></td>
<td>No need to install anything; just sign up.</td>
<td>Install WordPress yourself, either manually or via your host's control panel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Themes</strong></td>
<td>Use the themes made available by WordPress.com (<a href="https://wordpress.com/">https://wordpress.com/</a>).</td>
<td>Use any theme available anywhere, written by anyone (even by yourself).</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Plugins</strong></td>
<td>No ability to add third-party plugins.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Upgrades</strong></td>
<td>WordPress.com provides automatic upgrades.</td>
<td>You have to upgrade it yourself when upgrades are available.</td>

<td><strong>Widgets</strong></td>
<td>Widget availability depends on the available themes.</td>
<td>You can widgetize any theme yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Maintenance</strong></td>
<td>You don't have to do any maintenance.</td>
<td>You're responsible for the maintenance of your site.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Advertising</strong></td>
<td>No advertising of your own allowed. However, WordPress.com itself sometimes runs ads on your site.</td>
<td>You can advertise anything and in any amount you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ownership</strong></td>
<td>Even though the content belongs to you, WordPress.com can take down your blog at any moment if they consider it to be inappropriate.</td>
<td>You have complete control over your site, and no one can force you to take it down.</td>

<td><strong>Domain</strong></td>
<td>Your site is available as a subdomain under <kbd>.wordpress.com</kbd> by default, but you can also upgrade to a paid package and use your own, manually registered domain name.</td>
<td>You can use any manually registered domain name.</td>

<p>Overall, WordPress.org is a much better choice for those who want to learn how the WordPress platform works and how to use it to build optimized and versatile websites. WordPress.com might be a better solution for those who simply need a website fast.</p>

<p>We're going to cover how to install WordPress in three different ways.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In most scenarios, users will want to install and then use WordPress on a live website—one that's publicly visible. The easiest way to do that is to go to one of the popular hosting companies, rent some server space from them, and then have WordPress installed on that server. Even though this might sound intimidating at first, the process is actually very simple, and in most cases, the hosting company takes care of all the technical steps.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this approach is that you're effectively freed from having to worry about server configurations, and instead can simply start working with your WordPress website very quickly. The disadvantage—if we can call it that—is that you don't get the educational value from installing WordPress by hand.</p>

<p>There are many hosting companies that label themselves <em>for WordPress</em> in some capacity. Depending on the budget you have at hand, you can get an optimized hosting setup for as little as $3-4 a month. At the other end of the spectrum, there are also advanced setups at $100 a month or more. When picking a company for your needs, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your budget—as mentioned in the preceding paragraph</li>
<li>The number of sites you want to host at the same time—probably just one</li>
<li>How much traffic you're expecting on the site—probably less than 5,000 visitors a month if you're just starting out</li>
<li>The reputation of the company that you want to go with - this can be checked via sites like ReviewSignal (<a href="https://reviewsignal.com/webhosting">https://reviewsignal.com/webhosting</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>To show you how the installation process is done, we need to pick a host that we're going to use as our example. Looking at the scores at ReviewSignal, SiteGround seems to be at the top of the list, having the best user ratings among shared hosting platforms. We're going to pick that one for our example. Please keep in mind that this works similarly with most hosts, so you shouldn't see significant differences if you choose a different host.</p>
<p>To get started, go to <a href="https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm">https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once there, you can click on the sign-up button below the cheapest plan that SiteGround offers, as seen in the next screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ed41a76e-702c-47ed-af86-070baf3b629d.png" style="width:53.83em;height:26.50em;" width="1237" height="609"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the next step, you will be able to register a new domain name for your site or connect an existing domain name if you have one:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c28ebba0-605e-4e8f-8cdf-c2bfeff6bf71.png" style="width:38.75em;height:21.58em;" width="762" height="425"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The next step is all about inputting your personal data and finalizing the purchase. A couple of things you might want to pay special attention to—all visible in the next screenshot—is your server location and some extras that SiteGround offers you.</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5fd4f582-3c71-4cdb-a74b-89dd154759d0.png" style="width:38.83em;height:35.67em;" width="726" height="667"/></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">As for the server location, it's best to pick a location that's the closest to you.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">As for the extras, it's up to you if you need any of them—they are not mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you finalize this setup, you will have a new hosting account ready to go. Now the only thing that's left is to have WordPress installed on that account. What's good about SiteGround is that they will take care of the entire installation for you. When you first log in to your user panel at SiteGround, you will see a prompt asking you if you need any of the popular website platforms installed—with WordPress being one of the options.</p>
<p>The only thing you need to do here is provide SiteGround with your desired login details for WordPress and click the <span class="packt_screen">Confirm</span> button. That is all. After this step, you will see a new instance of WordPress in your SiteGround user panel. If you click on <span class="packt_screen">Go to Admin Panel</span>, you will be redirected to the main WordPress dashboard:</p>

<p>WordPress can be installed in a variety of different ways, and if you don't want to use the <em>via a host</em> method described earlier, you will probably be interested in installing WordPress manually.</p>
<p>Manual installations can be useful for a number of reasons. First of all, you might want to use WordPress on a local server. Secondly, even if you're on a remote server, that server might not have any auto-install features available. This is where the manual installation comes into play.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>A good first step is to make sure you have an environment setup that is ready for WordPress. This means you need to ensure that the server meets the minimum requirements and that your database is ready. For WordPress to work, your web host must provide you with a server that fulfills the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 7.2+ is recommended)</li>
<li>Provision of a MySQL database (full access) of version 5.6 or greater (alternatively, MariaDB version 10.0 or greater)</li>
</ul>
<p>These minimum requirements tend to change occasionally. The most current requirements can always be found at <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/</a>.</p>
<p>You can determine whether your host meets these two requirements by contacting the support team at your web host. If it does, you're ready to move on to the next step.</p>

<p>In order to test WordPress out, you don't actually need access to a live web server. You can do your tests on a local server as well and then only deploy your site to the public if need be. The most common way of working with local WordPress is by installing it on a XAMPP server. XAMPP is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, plus it is free. You can get it from <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>XAMPP's official website offers some guides on how to set up the server, but if you need a more step-by-step tutorial, please refer to <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/install-xampp-and-wordpress-locally/">https://themeisle.com/blog/install-xampp-and-wordpress-locally/</a>.<a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/install-xampp-and-wordpress-locally/"/></p>

<p>Once you have checked your environment, you need to download WordPress from <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">https://wordpress.org/download/</a>. There's a big blue download button there. It's hard to miss. What you get once you click it is a <kbd>.zip</kbd> archive of the most recent version of the WordPress software. Extracting that archive onto your desktop will give you a directory called <kbd>wordpress</kbd>. In itself, that directory isn't very useful as a stand-alone thing. In order to make it work, you <span>somehow </span>need to get it onto your web server. This will be covered in the next subsections in this chapter.</p>
<p>If you're working on local server setup, all you have to do is copy that WordPress directory to wherever your local server operates from. If you're working on a remote server, you'll have to use third-party tools to upload WordPress there. I'll show you how to do that next.</p>

<p>We need to upload all the files of WordPress to our web server using any <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>FTP</strong>) client. There are several FTP clients available on the internet that are either freeware (no cost) or require a small fee. If you don't already have an FTP client, try one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filezilla</strong>: <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client">https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client</a> (for Mac, Windows, or Linux)</li>
<li><strong>Fetch</strong>: <a href="https://fetchsoftworks.com/">https://fetchsoftworks.com/</a> (for Mac only)</li>
<li><strong>SmartFTP</strong>: <a href="https://www.smartftp.com/">https://www.smartftp.com/</a> (for Windows only)</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="packt_screen">A note about security</span><br/>
Whenever possible, you should use <strong>secure FTP</strong> (<strong>sFTP</strong>) rather than regular FTP. If you're using sFTP, all of the data sent and received is encrypted. With FTP, data is sent in plain text and can easily be nabbed by hackers. Check both your FTP software and your hosting options and select sFTP if it's available.</div>
<p>Here's the process of installing WordPress via FTP:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using your FTP client, connect to the FTP server using the server address, username, and password provided to you by your host. (If you're not sure what those are, you can always contact your web host support and ask a support agent for these details.)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next, open the folder where you want WordPress to live. You may want to install WordPress in your root folder, which will mean that visitors will see your WordPress website's home page when they go to your main URL - for example, <kbd>http://yoursite.com</kbd>. Alternatively, you may want to install WordPress in a subfolder, for example, <kbd>http://yoursite.com/blog/</kbd>. Refer to the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>On the left side, you will see the files from your local folder, and on the right side, you will see your remote folder. (Note that the FTP client you are using may have a slightly different layout, but this is a general idea.)</li>
<li>Now select all of the WordPress files on your local machine from the left pane, and drag them onto the right pane. You can watch as your FTP client uploads the files one at a time and they appear on the right panel. This may take a few minutes, so be patient.</li>
<li>If you're installing WordPress on your local server, just be sure to place the WordPress files in the correct <kbd>webroot</kbd> directory on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once all of the files have been uploaded, you're ready to proceed with the installation.</p>

<li>After this, you will be presented with another screen informing you of all the required details that you'll need in order to complete the installation successfully. Currently, those details are the following:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database name</span>: For example, this can be <kbd>wptestblog</kbd>.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database username</span>: For example, this can be <kbd>localdbuser</kbd>.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database password</span>: For example, <kbd>62dcx%^_0hnm</kbd>—the more complex the password, the better.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database host</span>: This is the host address of your web server's database. If you're running the server locally, this will be <kbd>localhost</kbd>. If you're trying to run WordPress on a third-party web host, this is the address of the database server of that host.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The big question, therefore, is where to get all of this information from. The answer is your web host. Most of the large web hosts offer you a way to create your own databases via an online control panel, with usernames and passwords of your choice. If you're not sure how to do this, just email or call your hosting provider for assistance. Professional support teams will be glad to help you with this.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once you have those four parameters, you can press the <span class="packt_screen">Let's go!</span> button and proceed to the next step of the installation. The following is a screenshot of the main setup form:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b5d016a5-6b6c-4543-a07b-b07097d53160.png" style="width:39.25em;height:27.75em;" width="951" height="672"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the details are the same as those shown in an earlier screenshot. Of course, your details will be different. Also, another important point to note is that there's an additional field labeled <span class="packt_screen">Table Prefix</span>. This is the default prefix that every table in your database will have before its name. The default value in that field is <kbd>wp_</kbd>. It is recommended that you change this to any two- or three-letter word of your choice and end it with an underscore (<kbd>_</kbd>), just as a safety precaution against standard database attacks on known WordPress tables.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>After clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Submit</span> button, you will be redirected to the final confirmation page. All you have to do here is click on the <span class="packt_screen">Run the install</span> button. The best indication that the online installation is going well is the presence of the following screen:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0ef58c64-bb01-4430-8be1-9183804ede30.png" style="width:44.42em;height:46.58em;" width="969" height="1016"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>This is the final setup page. Here, you set up the core details of your new site. Now, fill out the installation form (you will be able to change all of these later, so don't be too worried about getting locked into your choices):
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Site Title</span>: Fill in the name of your blog (it can be something simple, such as <em>Daily Cooking</em>).</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Username</span>: It's in your best interest to choose a username that's not obvious. For instance, if you go with <em>admin</em>, it will be very easy to guess for someone who might want to hack into your blog. Also worth pointing out is the fact that this account is the administrator account, which has the most privileges and access rights to all areas of the site. Opt for something difficult to guess, such as <em>Site-Master-45</em> and don't worry, silly is good.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Password</span>: Choose a secure password, one that has both upper and lowercase letters, a number or two, and even a few punctuation marks. WordPress suggests some options for you here.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Your Email</span>: Double-check that this is correct. This is the email address WordPress will use to contact you about the blog, comments, and so on. If you do not get an email from your WordPress site shortly after installing it, check your spam folder.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Search Engine Visibility</span>: This is the final checkbox, yet possibly one of the most important settings on this list. If you leave it unchecked (recommended), your site is going to be accessible through Google and other search engines. Checking it means banning your site from the search engines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, click on <span class="packt_screen">Install WordPress</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You're done with the installation! WordPress will now greet you with the main login page - this is where you can access the main admin panel of the website (also known as the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>). Alternatively, you can also enter the admin panel by pointing your browser to <kbd>http://yoursite.com/wp-admin</kbd>. If you're not already logged in, this URL will redirect you to the login page.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing WordPress through an auto-installer script</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Some web hosts provide their customers with access to a range of auto-installer scripts for various web platforms, including WordPress. Most of these auto-installers have quite similar functionalities, and the actual process of installing a new WordPress site is similar as well. Here, we're going to focus on one of these scripts, <strong>Softaculous</strong> (<a href="https://www.softaculous.com/">https://www.softaculous.com/</a>).</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">This is yet another way of installing a WordPress site, and we're covering it here to make this book as complete as it can be. However, if you've already managed to install your site using the methods described earlier, then this section won't be of any use to you at this point.</div>
<p>Softaculous is the preferred method of WordPress installation for many professional developers and bloggers. In some cases, it's the fastest method when dealing with a completely new hosting account maintained by a new web host. Softaculous is available on hosting accounts running on many management platforms, such as <em>cPanel</em>, <em>Plesk</em>, <em>DirectAdmin</em>, <em>InterWorx</em>, and <em>H-Sphere</em>. Most probably, your hosting account will be using one of these platforms. The following screenshot shows cPanel, which is the most popular platform of its kind:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e2a586c1-ad19-4ba8-abae-26549f34a9bb.png" width="1181" height="765"/></p>
<p>Although different platforms have different user interfaces, the core functionalities from a user's point of view remain mostly the same. To access Softaculous, just scroll down until you see the main section (or icon) labeled Softaculous. Once there, you can see the WordPress icon among the others:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f591db7c-603b-496a-be3b-338a42706412.png" width="1312" height="451"/></p>
<p>The whole idea of using this script is to make things quicker and more hassle-free so that you don't have to take care of creating databases manually or of setting configuration files. Softaculous will handle all of this for you. The following is the site creation form:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6ee7fb0b-c10b-43ae-a7f6-8a7b02846af2.png" style="width:41.50em;height:50.67em;" width="743" height="908"/></p>
<p>Keep in mind that those interfaces tend to change from time to time, so depending on when you read this book, your Softaculous panel may look different. Don't worry though, as it surely will be similarly understandable. Here's a breakdown of all the fields you can expect to see and what details to put in them:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Choose Protocol</span>: You can stick with the default value of <kbd>http://</kbd> or change to <kbd>https://</kbd>, if available.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Choose Domain</span>: If you have more than one domain assigned to your hosting account, then you get to choose which one you want to use here. For single-domain accounts (most likely the case), this drop-down field has only one option.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">In Directory</span>: If you want to install your WordPress site under a subdirectory, then input its name here (just the name). If you want to install the site in the main directory (<kbd>http://yoursite.com/</kbd>), then make sure the field is blank.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database Name</span>: You can confidently go with the default value.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Table Prefix</span>: As discussed earlier in this chapter, you can change this to something unique (in my case, it's <kbd>wp_</kbd>).</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Site Name</span>: This is the name of your site (in the present case, <kbd>My Blog</kbd>).</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Site Description</span>: This is the tagline (in the present case, <span class="packt_screen">My WordPress Blog</span>).</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Enable Multisite (WPMU)</span>: Leave this unchecked unless you're an advanced user planning to launch a multisite installation.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Admin Username</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Admin Password</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Admin Email</span>: These are the details of your admin account, similar to the ones we had to provide during the manual WordPress installation.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Select Language</span>: WordPress has many localized versions of the platform, not just English, and you can choose one here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Install</span> button starts the installation process. The process itself requires no supervision, and you will be able to access your site as soon as it finishes after roughly 1 or 2 minutes. You can check whether the installation has been successful through the standard <kbd>http://yoursite.com/</kbd> and <kbd>http://yoursite.com/wp-admin/</kbd> URLs. In other words, this is the end of the installation process through Softaculous. As you can see, it's much simpler and quicker than manual installation. Furthermore, Softaculous always installs the most recent version of WordPress, so you don't have to worry about getting something out of date.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can also encounter other auto-installer scripts, which are similar to Softaculous, such as <em>Fantastico</em>, <em>Installatron</em>, <em>MOJO</em>, and <em>SimpleScripts</em>.</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The wp-admin panel</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>WordPress installs a powerful and flexible administration area where you can manage all of your website content and so much more. Throughout the book, this will be referred to in shorthand as the <strong>wp-admin</strong>, or <strong>WP Admin</strong>, or the <strong>WordPress dashboard</strong> in some cases.</p>
<p>Now that you've successfully installed WordPress, it's time for our first look at the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. There are some immediate basic changes that are recommended to make sure your installation is set up properly.</p>
<p>You can always get to the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> by visiting <kbd>http://yoursite.com/wp-admin/</kbd> (this URL is also the reason why we're calling it the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>). If it's your first time there, you'll be redirected to the login page. In the future, WordPress will check whether you're already logged in and if so, you'll skip the login page.</p>
<p>To log in, just enter the username and password you chose during the installation. Then, click on <span class="packt_screen">Log In</span>.</p>
<p>Whenever you log in, you'll be taken directly to the <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span> section of the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. The following is a screenshot of the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> that you will see immediately after logging in:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1ab97ad6-1bde-40b7-8a81-66c3c7567481.png" width="1938" height="1015"/></p>
<p>You'll see a lot of information and options there, which we will explore throughout this book. For now, we will focus on the items that we need to consider right after a successful installation. First, let's take a brief look into the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> and the main <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span> section. The very top bar there, referred to as the <em>top bar</em> or <em>admin bar</em>, is mostly dark gray and contains the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/77933255-e9d4-4397-bcd7-faa53ab9b036.png" style="width:28.92em;height:4.75em;" width="784" height="128"/></p>
<ul>
<li>A rollover drop-down menu, triggered by hovering over the WordPress logo in the top-left corner, featuring a set of links to <span class="packt_screen">About WordPress</span> (some details about the current installation of WordPress), <span class="packt_screen">WordPress.org</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Documentation</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Support Forums</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Feedback</span></li>
<li>A link to the front page of your WordPress website (in this example, the title of the whole site is <em>Daily Cooking</em>), the clickable <em>house</em> icon</li>
<li>An updates and activity section containing either links to the newest comments or pending updates</li>
<li>A rollover drop-down menu with handy links to <span class="packt_screen">New Post</span>, <span class="packt_screen">New Media</span>, <span class="packt_screen">New Page</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">New User</span>, triggered by hovering over the <em>plus</em> icon</li>
<li>Lastly, on the far right, your user-linked to your profile, which is yet another drop-down menu containing a link labeled <span class="packt_screen">Edit My Profile</span> and, finally, the <span class="packt_screen">Log Out</span> link</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll also notice the <span class="packt_screen">Screen Options</span> tab, which appears on many screens within the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. If you click on it, it will slide down a checklist of items on the page to show or hide. This will be different on each page. I encourage you to play around with this element by checking and unchecking the items, as you discover whether you need them or not:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cd565f82-63e5-4028-a1b7-2f069626dbf3.png" style="width:41.58em;height:7.00em;" width="1411" height="238"/></p>
<p>Right next to the <span class="packt_screen">Screen Options</span> tab, you will find the <span class="packt_screen">Help</span> tab. Just like the <span class="packt_screen">Screen Options</span> tab, this one appears on many screens within the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. Whenever you're in doubt regarding a specific screen, you can always check the <span class="packt_screen">Help</span> tab for instructions. Accessing the <span class="packt_screen">Help</span> tab is always quicker and, in most cases, more effective than searching for solutions online.</p>
<p>On the left side of the screen is the main menu:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/74c582fc-30c7-4af7-9445-851c1b9854f5.png" style="width:10.25em;height:29.75em;" width="203" height="588"/></p>
<p>You can click on any word in the main menu to be taken to the dedicated page for that section, or you can hover your cursor over a given link to see all of the possible subsections you can visit. For example, if you hover your cursor over <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>, you'll see the subpages for the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> section, and at that point, you can click on either of the subpages or the main <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> link itself:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c0e0eff4-1c8c-4f6e-a546-14ae51d9e200.png" style="width:17.58em;height:12.33em;" width="315" height="220"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span>The top menu and the main menu exist on every</span> page <span>within the</span> <kbd>wp-admin</kbd><span>. The main section on the right contains information for the current page you're on. In this case, we're in the </span><span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span><span> section. It contains boxes that have information about your blog, and about WordPress in general.</span></p>
<p>In the new versions of WordPress, when you log in for the first time, you're presented with a welcome message, similar to the one that follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/db61d4d0-87a6-4ebe-abf8-86fefe63b7b2.png" style="width:44.67em;height:14.08em;" width="803" height="253"/></p>
<p>In short, it's the welcome panel that allows you to access some of the crucial sections of the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> with just one click. Once you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Dismiss</span> link, the panel will no longer be displayed after login. In its current version, the panel allows you to do the following (going from top left to bottom right):</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize the current theme, but only if the theme provides some customization features (not all themes do)</li>
<li>Change the current theme to a new one</li>
<li>Edit the front page</li>
<li>Create new pages</li>
<li>Write your first blog post</li>
<li>View your site</li>
<li>Manage menus and widgets</li>
<li>Turn comments on or off (by default, they are on)</li>
<li>Learn more about how to get started with WordPress, which is an external link pointing to <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress">https://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this and the following chapters, we will get to know all of the crucial methods of managing a WordPress site, and once we gain some experience, with time, this welcome panel can make our everyday work much quicker. Therefore, let's jump right into the general site settings section.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">In this book, all instructions regarding which page within the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> to navigate to are indicated by phrases such as <em>navigate to Settings | General</em> or <em>navigate to Posts | Add New</em>. This always describes the path you should take to get there via the main menu.</div>

        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Changing general blog information</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You may need to change or add some general blog information<span> </span><span>after a successful installation</span><span> (such as the blog title or a one-sentence description) to get your website set up and running with the correct information. To get started with this, navigate to </span><span class="packt_screen">Settings</span><span> in the main menu:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0e10b7b7-1c9a-4685-8be9-7bb0f9897742.png" style="width:17.67em;height:12.08em;" width="326" height="223"/></p>
<p>There are many options you can set here, most of which are self-explanatory. We'll look at the most important ones. Obviously, you can change your blog's title. Mine is called <span class="packt_screen">Daily Cooking</span>, for example. You can also change the blog description, which is used in most themes as a subtitle for the blog, like the subtitle of a book. The default description is <em>Just another WordPress site.</em> You'll probably want to change that. Let's change ours to <kbd>Exploring cooking every day of the week</kbd>:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/4361b519-a947-47ca-a131-c9898c075d0f.png" width="1950" height="1454"/></p>
<p>One <span>of the things</span> <span>you probably want to take a look at on this page is the </span><span class="packt_screen">Timezone</span><span> option. Whether you have a blog (with timestamps on every post) or not, it's important that WordPress knows what time zone you're in. Particularly when you want to schedule a page or post for the future, show users accurate time stamps, or even just make sure that email notifications are correctly timestamped. Additionally, if you're planning to publish content internationally, meaning that your target audience is located in an entirely different location, it's good to set the time zone to represent your target</span> audience and not yourself.</p>
<p>The pull-down menu will show you different UTC settings, along with the biggest cities around the world. Just choose a city in your favored time zone. After you save the changes, the time that appears further down the page (next to <span class="packt_screen">Time Format</span>) will change to the time you chose, so that you can check and make sure it's correct.</p>
<p>Another feature worth considering on this page is whether or not you want to allow user registration on your site. For most sites, this is not particularly useful, but if you're planning to make the site community-driven or utilize some form of crowdsourcing, then this might be worth considering. In that case, it's not advisable to give new users a user role higher than <span class="packt_screen">Subscriber</span> (the default value).</p>
<p>When you're done making changes to this page, be sure to click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save Changes</span> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Finally, there's only one more component you should adjust in your new site's settings before publishing any content: the permalinks. As WordPress defines them, <em>permalinks</em> are the permanent URLs to your individual pages, blog posts, categories, and tags. By default, WordPress links to your new posts using a highly unoptimized URL structure. For instance, if you create a post titled <em>How to Cook the Best Meal Ever,</em> WordPress will link it as <kbd>http://yoursite.com/?p=123</kbd> (or something similar). The main problem with this structure is that it doesn't indicate what the page is about. Neither your visitors nor Google will be able to make a guess. In the case of Google, such a structure can also significantly impact your future search engine rankings. Therefore, to set a more optimized structure, you can go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings | Permalinks</span>. Here are the available settings:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/d2579796-bd4d-4436-afb0-9798f5f0afbf.png" style="width:34.17em;height:23.92em;" width="720" height="505"/></p>
<p>The best setting from a visitor's point of view, as well as from Google's, is the one labeled <span class="packt_screen">Post name</span>. Going back to the example with the <em>How to Cook the Best Meal Ever</em> post, if you set the permalinks to <span class="packt_screen">Post name</span>, the URL of this post will be <kbd>http://yoursite.com/how-to-cook-the-best-meal-ever/</kbd>, which is a lot clearer and predictable. You can always review the official information on permalinks whenever you wish at <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks">https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks</a>.</p>
<p>Further down the page, there are also optional settings for <span class="packt_screen">Category base</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Tag base</span>. By default, <span class="packt_screen">Category base</span> is set to <kbd>category</kbd>. For example, if you have a category called <em>recipes</em> then you can view all posts under this category at <kbd>http://yoursite.com/category/recipes</kbd>.</p>
<p>Some site owners prefer to change this to something more user-friendly, for example, <kbd>topics</kbd>. Even though this conveys the exact same message, it can be much easier to grasp for visitors who are not that familiar with the standards of web content publishing. In the end, your category base is solely down to your discretion. <span class="packt_screen">Tag base</span>, on the other hand, rarely needs any adjustments.</p>

<p>One final point that's worth discussing in this chapter is the matter of WordPress avatars. Although WordPress provides a number of possibilities in this area, the most popular one revolves around an external service, <strong>Globally Recognized Avatar</strong> (<strong>Gravatar</strong>). Gravatar started as a tool meant to provide people with the capability of using the same profile picture (avatar) across the entire web.</p>
<p>What this means in plain English is that whenever you sign up for a web service, and if the service is Gravatar-compatible, so to speak, then it will fetch your profile picture from Gravatar automatically, instead of forcing you to upload it manually from your computer. Apart from the profile picture, Gravatar also gives you a personal online profile that anyone can see whenever they click on your (Gravatar) profile picture or something called Hovercard. Now, what does all this have to do with WordPress, right? Well, WordPress is one of those services and tools that widely support Gravatar in all possible areas of the platform. For example, if you create a new blog and use an admin email address that's hooked up to Gravatar, your profile picture in WordPress will immediately be replaced with the one provided by Gravatar. Moreover, if you ever comment on any WordPress blog with a Gravatar email address, your profile picture will be set as the avatar for the comment itself.</p>
<p>To set your own Gravatar, just go to <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">https://en.gravatar.com/</a> and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Create Your Own Gravatar</span> button. You'll be presented with a sign-up form for Gravatar. Since Gravatar is part of WordPress.com, you are able to log in if you already have a WordPress.com account. If not, you can create a new one. The fields are quite standard, with you being prompted to enter your email address and your preferred username and password.</p>
<p>Once you've completed the sign-up process, you can finally set your Gravatar. On the main <span class="packt_screen">Manage Gravatars</span> page (accessible via the top menu), there's a link labeled <span class="packt_screen">Add a new image</span>—this is where you can upload a Gravatar. The good thing about Gravatar is that you can choose where you want to get the picture from. You can either upload it from your computer, get it from some other place on the web (for example, from a direct link to your Facebook profile image), or use a picture that you've uploaded as your Gravatar previously.</p>
<p>In the next step, Gravatar allows you to crop and adjust your image. When you're finally happy with the result, you can click the big button and proceed to the rating settings of your image. Every Gravatar can be classified as <strong>G-rated</strong>, <strong>PG-rated</strong>, <strong>R-rated</strong>, or <strong>X-rated</strong>. The fact is that if you select anything other than <strong>G-rated</strong>, your Gravatar won't be displayed on all sites. Thus, it's a good practice to upload only appropriate images. When you're done with this step, from now on, your Gravatar is set up and ready to use. Gravatar also enables you to hook up more than one email address to a single account, as well as use more than one image. This is actually a great feature because you can manage each of your email addresses and every form of your online presence with just one Gravatar account.</p>
<p>Now, you can go back to your WordPress blog and check whether your new Gravatar has appeared in the profile section within the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> (provided that you've used the same email address for the account).</p>
