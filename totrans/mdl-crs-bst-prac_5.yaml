- en: Being able to take a course at any time, any place, and at your own pace makes
    online course offerings very popular. While many courses are instructor-led and
    may involve extensive interaction with other students, there are also many courses
    that are self-guided and contain self-scoring and adaptive assessments that do
    not require interaction with an instructor or other students.

- en: With Moodle, you can create standalone, self-paced, and independent study courses
    that can be used in many settings and for various purposes. They may be short
    training courses that all employees must take for safety, health, or regulatory
    compliance purposes. They could be review courses on certain subjects or courses
    that are created for a wide audience or just for fun.

    all your self-paced independent study courses. We'll review plugins, resources,
    and activities that you will find useful to include. We'll then learn how to set
    up the courses at the individual course level and review the best ways to add
    resources, activities, and assessments. We'll also discuss how to make sure that
    your students can track their progress and how to automatically generate customized
    certificates upon course completion. Finally, we'll learn how to set up **badges**,
    build them, and also enable social media so your students can display them.

- en: Self-paced independent study means that your students are working on their own
    and that they will not have any direct interaction with an instructor or other
    students. Thus, there are a number of elements in Moodle that you will not need
    to include in your course website. For example, you will not need a forum and
    activities that require grading by an instructor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, if students are working on their own, you may need to include
    self-help elements. You'll definitely need tools, such as a progress tracker,
    to help students know where they stand in the course, and you'll need to make
    sure that your instructional material, activities, and assessments tie together
    very clearly. You can build in activities such as low-stakes self-grading quizzes
    that keep students engaged and motivated. Keeping students motivated is critical
    because self-paced classes require students to motivate themselves and there is
    no teacher or tutor to provide external structure.

    complexity, and "stakes." Some can be completed in less than an hour, while others
    may be intended for completion over a semester. They can be offered by colleges,
    universities, corporations, not-for-profit organizations, retailers, and other
    organizations that need to provide educational courses and training. With the
    advent of mobile-friendly interfaces, such as Moodle's responsive skins which
    are designed to work on all kinds of tablets, smartphones, and laptops, self-paced
    independent study courses are more convenient than ever.

    save and upload the presentation to a number of sites, such as YouTube, Flickr,
    and UStream. The advantages of using screen capture software are that the quality
    tends to be high, and there is quite a bit of flexibility. The disadvantages are
    that there can be a steep learning curve and the software licenses can be expensive.

    your course to make available when you create a screencast. You will then be following
