<p>Once you have a version of your new plugin that is ready to be distributed to the masses, you need to decide whether you will join the official WordPress repository or self-publish it.</p>
<p>In most cases, the preferred option is to add your new extension to the official WordPress plugin repository, where you have many benefits, including free hosting, built-in notification of new updates, and a powerful search engine that users can access on <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a> or from the <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> section of their website's administration pages. Other benefits of hosting on the official repository include download statistics and the creation of a free forum to facilitate user support. To qualify for this hosting, your work must be free and open source, as well as comply with the GNU General Public License, Version 2 (also known as GPL v2), a common open source software license that WordPress itself uses.</p>
<p>This includes any code you wrote, along with any third-party PHP or Javascript libraries that you have included in your work. To learn more about the GPL v2 license, visit <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html</span></a>. It is also possible to publish a plugin with paid premium features on the official repository, but you cannot move free features behind a paywall over time.</p>
<p>In comparison, self-hosting gives you full control over pricing, distribution license, and general presentation of your work, but it makes it harder for people to find your plugin and relies on implementing a custom update notification mechanism yourself, using third-party libraries to add equivalent functionality or having users manually download updates when available. There are also a number of popular plugin digital marketplaces that can help alleviate some of these drawbacks, but your work will still have less visibility than it would on the official repository.</p>
<p>Before making your plugin publicly available, you should also be sure that you are ready to deal with user feedback and questions. Once your creation is available for download, WordPress website administrators will quickly download it, install it, and may find that your work covers most, but not all, of their needs. When this happens, you will start getting requests to add functionality. This interaction with users is usually a great experience that can bring new ideas to the table that will enhance your work, but you should also be ready to accept criticism and invest time in fixing issues and implementing new features. You also need to think of the time that will be involved in testing your extension against new versions of WordPress, which typically come out two to three times a year.</p>
<p>This chapter explains how to prepare your work to be uploaded to the official plugin repository, including the application for an account, the actual code submission using Subversion, and how to customize your plugin page to give it a unique look.</p>

<p>If you look at any plugins on the official WordPress repository, you will see that their page contains a lot of information, including a description of the extension, a list of frequently asked questions, and installation notes. As you may have noticed from the work that we have done so far, this data does not reside in the main plugin's code file. Instead, the official WordPress repository looks for this information in a specially formatted <kbd>readme.txt</kbd> file that needs to be included with the plugin.</p>
<p>This recipe shows how to create a <kbd>readme.txt</kbd> file for the Book Reviews plugin that we created in <a href="6298bc2b-19d5-4e3a-833c-3c4b667b22e5.xhtml"><em><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 4</span></em></a>, <em>The Power of Custom Post Types</em>.</p>

<p>You should have already followed the <em>Updating page title to include custom post data using plugin filters</em> recipe from <a href="6298bc2b-19d5-4e3a-833c-3c4b667b22e5.xhtml"><em><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 4</span></em></a>, <em>The Power of Custom Post Types</em>, to have a starting point for this recipe. Alternatively, you can get the resulting code (<kbd>Chapter 4/ch4-book-reviews/ch4-book-reviews-v11.php</kbd>) for that recipe from the code bundle.</p>

<p>The <kbd>readme.txt</kbd> file uses a wiki-like syntax, with the number of equal signs (<kbd>=</kbd>) indicating the level of each section header. The first and most important section is the header, which contains important information, such as the plugin's name, the author's <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a> username, donation link, search tags, supported versions, along with a one-line description of its functionality. This last item will always be visible as users navigate through your plugin's pages.</p>
<p>The initial header is followed by multiple sections, which correspond to the various sections that appear within a plugin's display pages. More specifically, these sections contain a complete description of the extension's capability, a step-by-step guide to installing and using your work, a change log containing a list of all the versions with a summary of changes for each of them, frequently asked questions, and screenshots. It is also possible for plugin authors to create their own arbitrary section using the same syntax.</p>
<p>As with the standard wiki syntax, the repeating <kbd>1.</kbd> in front of each installation step will be converted to incrementing values when the system displays these bullets using an ordered list on the live website. Finally, if screenshots are listed in the <kbd>readme.txt</kbd> file, the <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a> website will search for files whose names start with the keyword <kbd>screenshot-</kbd>, followed by a number corresponding to the values listed in the screenshot section, and display them with the associated text as a legend. When taking screenshots of your plugin in action, make sure that they are clear and meaningful, as visitors will often decide whether they will download your creations based on these images.</p>
<p>You can find more details about the <kbd>readme.txt</kbd> file format in the <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://wordpress.org</a> plugin handbook (<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-your-readme-txt-works/">https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-your-readme-txt-works/</a>).</p>

<p>To keep plugin code files more organized and have complete control over releases, you should consider using Subversion tags.</p>

<p>Tags are a Subversion concept that allows developers to identify a group of files at a specific point in time and label them with a name. This name can be used to specify the version of your plugin that <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a> visitors will be able to download. While this recipe specifies a value of <kbd>trunk</kbd> as the <kbd>Stable Tag</kbd>, indicating that the latest version of the files uploaded to the plugin's <kbd>trunk</kbd> folder will be released, it's possible to indicate any other tag name in this field. In addition to keeping your work more organized, working with tags allows you to commit partially implemented new plugin features to your repository without having them automatically available for all to access.</p>

<p>After creating proper documentation for your creation, the next step toward its publication on the official plugin repository is to apply for hosting. This is simply done by submitting a request form in the <span class="packt_screen">Developer Center</span> section on <a href="http://wordpress.org">http://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a>.</p>
<p>This recipe shows how to apply for plugin hosting and offers tips to follow for quick acceptance.</p>

<p>Plugin submission is a fairly simple process, giving developers access to a Subversion repository that they can use to upload their work and share it with the community.</p>
<p>Before submitting your plugin, you should search through existing plugins to be sure that you have not selected a name that already exists in the repository, as that will result in your request being turned down. You can do this by using the website's search engine, as well as trying to access an address that was named based on your plugin name. For example, following our <span class="packt_screen">Book Reviews</span> plugin example, you could check to see whether the address <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/book-reviews"><span class="URLPACKT">https://wordpress.org/plugins/book-reviews</span></a> exists.</p>
<p>It should be noted that your plugin needs to be functional when you apply to be listed on the repository. Once your plugin has been approved, you will get access to a hosted Subversion version control repository to easily keep backups of all the versions of your work during development and easily publish your work. If you work on a plugin with one or more people, this infrastructure will make it very easy to exchange code between all contributors.</p>

<p>If you thought that using Subversion in the recipes of <a href=""><em><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 1</span></em></a>, <em>Preparing a Local Development Environment</em>, was overkill when you're working on a plugin locally, you will see that this knowledge comes in very handy once your hosting request has been approved by the WordPress team, as the system's backend relies on that version control system.</p>
<p>This recipe shows how to submit your creation to the <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a> website once a repository has been created for you.</p>

<p>You should have already followed the <em>Applying for your plugin to be hosted on WordPress.org</em> recipe to have an approved repository on the official website. You should have also installed a Subversion client, as shown in the <em>Creating a local Subversion repository</em> recipe in <a href=""><em><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 1</span></em></a>, <em>Preparing a Local Development Environment</em>. Finally, you should have plugin files ready for upload.</p>

<p>The official WordPress plugin repository uses Subversion to manage all code files, provide version control services to developers, and find information to populate the extension's page. When your new repository is created, it contains three main directories: <kbd>trunk</kbd>, <kbd>tags</kbd>, and <kbd>branches</kbd>.</p>
<p>The <kbd>trunk</kbd> directory is usually the main location where you place the latest version of your plugin files. Following the steps in the recipe, we copy our files to this location and commit them to the server. Once uploaded, the W<span class="URLPACKT">ordPress.org</span> servers take care of creating a zipped copy of your work.</p>
<p>The <kbd>tags</kbd> directory is designed to hold pointers to various versions of your creation over time, as discussed in the <em>Creating a README file for your plugin</em> recipe. This functionality used in conjunction with the <span class="packt_screen">Stable tag</span> field of your plugin's <kbd>readme.txt</kbd> file allows you to redirect users to a known working version of your work while you commit and test potentially unstable work to the <kbd>trunk</kbd>. New tags are created using the <span class="packt_screen">Branch/Tag</span> item of the <span class="packt_screen">TortoiseSVN</span> menu and associating a name to a specific revision. The <kbd>branches</kbd> directory has a similar function to <kbd>tags</kbd>, but is more focused toward the creation of alternate versions of plugins or in-development revisions that include specific functionality.</p>

<p>When checking out the complete plugin directory, you end up with a structure that cannot be executed directly in a local development installation of WordPress for testing and development purposes. Instead of checking out the entire directory structure, you can limit your selection to the <kbd>trunk</kbd> directory. This will only copy the contents of that specific folder to your system and you can set the target folder to be located directly under the plugins directory.</p>

<p>While the plugin listing that we put in place by creating a <kbd>readme.txt</kbd> file and uploading it to the official plugin repository is perfectly functional, it does not really stand out among the sea of extensions that are available on the website. Thankfully, <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://wordpress.org</a> introduced a mechanism allowing plugin developers to add a banner image to their listing. This image can be anything from a simple picture to a complex graphic to advertise your creation.</p>
<p>This recipe explains how to prepare images for your plugin and how to upload them to your repository.</p>

<p>You should have already followed the <em>Applying for your plugin to be hosted on wordpress.org</em> and <em>Uploading your plugin using Subversion</em> recipes to have an approved repository on the official repository and plugin files uploaded to the server.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new image that is exactly 772 x 250 pixels.</li>
<li>Save the image as a PNG file with the name <kbd>banner-772x250.png</kbd>.</li>
<li>Right-click on a file explorer and select the <span class="packt_screen">TortoiseSVN</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Repo-Browser</span> menu.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Enter the address of your plugin repository. For example, for a plugin named <span class="packt_screen">Book</span> <span class="packt_screen">Reviews</span>, the address would be <kbd>http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/book-reviews</kbd>.</li>
<li>Create a new top-level directory named <kbd>assets</kbd>, at the same level as <kbd>trunk</kbd>, <kbd>tags</kbd>, and <kbd>branches</kbd>.</li>
<li>Select the <kbd>assets</kbd> directory, then drag and drop the new image file in the folder to upload it to the server.</li>
<li>Specify a Log Message in the dialog that appears to explain why the file is being uploaded.</li>
<li>Create smaller images that are exactly 256 x 256 pixels and 128 x 128 pixels in size and name the files <kbd>icon-256x256.png</kbd> and <kbd>icon-128x128.png</kbd>, respectively. The larger icon should be a higher resolution version of the exact content of the smaller one, since it will be used to replace the smaller one on high DPI displays.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 to upload the two icons to the <kbd>assets</kbd> directory.</li>
<li>Visit your plugin's page on <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a> to see the images in place:</li>

<ol start="11">
<li>Search for your plugin through the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins">https://wordpress.org/plugins</a> page or the <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> section of the <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> management interface of WordPress to see how the icon and short plugin description are used:</li>

<p>When files are uploaded to the plugin repositories, the <a href="https://wordpress.org">https://<span class="URLPACKT">wordpress.org</span></a> website checks for the presence of specific image files with specific names for the plugin banner and icon. If these files are present, it changes the layout of the plugin page to incorporate the images. It is important to respect the image format and specified dimensions when creating a plugin banner and icons to make sure that they are displayed properly on the website.</p>
