- en: Developing plugins for WordPress is the next big thing for you if you are an
    administrator looking to enhance a personal site with custom functionality for
    which no plugin exists, a developer looking to enhance the WordPress platform
    with new ideas for the community, or a website designer building a specific project
    for a client. Learning how to create WordPress plugins will allow you to unleash
    the full potential of the most popular web content management system.

- en: As an early WordPress adopter, before version 1.0 was out, I started building
    plugins to add functionality to my personal site. Once I got these new elements
    in place, I quickly realized that other users could benefit from these extensions,
    and started distributing them online. To this day, I always love hearing back
    from users of my creations and finding out how they have put them to use and what
    new functionality they think would make them even better.

- en: While developing plugins might initially sound a little bit like black magic,
    this book shows you how easy creating plugins actually is through a series of
    step-by-step recipes. If you have previously added code to a theme's functions
    file, you may even be familiar with some of the mechanics explained in this book.
    With all of the information contained in this book, you will quickly be able to
    create your own plugins or dissect existing ones to add that extra bit of missing
    functionality that you require. Before you know, you'll be publishing your own
    creations to the official WordPress plugin repository!
