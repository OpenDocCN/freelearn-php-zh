- en: Reactive programming has gained distinct popularity in recent years. This is
    partly thanks to JavaScript web frameworks such as Angular2 or React, but also
    because of the increasing popularity of functional and asynchronous programming
    in languages that support multiple programming paradigms, such as JavaScript,
    Java, Python, or PHP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nowadays, reactive programming is closely associated with Reactive Extensions
    (also called ReactiveX or just Rx); the most popular library to leverage reactive
    programming. Notably, RxJS 5, the JavaScript implementation of Rx, is very likely
    to be the first encounter with reactive programming for many developers. In this
    book, we will mostly focus on using the PHP port of Rx, called RxPHP ([https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPHP](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPHP)).

- en: Asynchronous programming is not what PHP developers typically deal with. In
    fact, it’s kind of an uncharted territory because there aren’t many resources
    available on this topic in PHP. Since reactive programming goes hand in hand with
    asynchronous programming, we’ll work a lot with event loops, blocking and non-blocking
    code, subprocesses, threads, and IPC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our primary intention, however, will be learning Reactive Extensions and reactive
    programming with RxPHP. This book includes both RxPHP 1 and RxPHP 2\. All examples
    are written for RxPHP 1 because the API is almost the same, and at the time of
    writing this book, RxPHP 2 is still in development. Also, RxPHP 1 requires just
    PHP 5.6+, while RxPHP 2 requires PHP 7+. Nonetheless, we’ll properly emphasize
    and explain whenever the APIs of RxPHP 1 and RxPHP 2 differ.

    "Chapter 1. Introduction to Reactive Programming"), *Introduction to Reactive
    Programming*, explains definitions of typical programming paradigms such as imperative,
    asynchronous, functional, parallel, and reactive programming. We’ll see what are
    the prerequisites to use functional programming in PHP and how all this is related
    to Reactive Extensions. At the end, we’ll introduce the RxPHP library as a tool
    of choice for this entire book.'

    presents the basic concepts and common terminology used in reactive programming

    "Chapter 3. Writing a Reddit Reader with RxPHP"), *Writing a Reddit Reader with
    RxPHP*, builds on the knowledge from the previous chapter to write a Reddit reader
    application internally based on RxPHP. This will require downloading data via
    cURL and handling user input, and comparing the difference between blocking and
    non-blocking code in PHP in relation to RxPHP. We’ll also have a sneak peak into
    using event loops in PHP.'

    "Chapter 4. Reactive versus a Typical Event-Driven Approach"), *Reactive versus
    a Typical Event-Driven Approach*, shows that in order to use Rx in practice, we
    need to know how can we combine RxPHP code with some already existing code that
    isn’t based on Rx. For this reason, we’ll take the Event Dispatcher component
    that comes with the Symfony3 framework and extend it with Rx functionality.'

    is a crucial part of every development process. Apart from PHPUnit, we’ll also
    use the special testing classes that come with RxPHP out of the box. We’ll also
    take a look at testing asynchronous code in general and what caveats we need to
    be aware of.'

    Higher-Order Observables*, introduces the PHP Streams API and event loops. These
    two concepts are tightly coupled in RxPHP and we’ll learn why and how. We’ll talk
    about the issues we can encounter when using multiple event loops in the same
    application and how the PHP community is trying to solve them. We’ll also introduce
    the concept of higher-order Observables as a more advanced functionality of Rx.'

    and client as three separate processes that communicate with each other via Unix
    sockets and WebSockets. We’ll also use in practice the higher-order Observables
