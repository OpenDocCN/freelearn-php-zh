    Web"), *The World Wide Web*, you learned about the World Wide Web and how all
    these millions of pages are accessed by people using a browser that sends requests
    to a web server using the HTTP protocol. Well, people will still use browsers
    that send HTTP requests, but we just tossed the web server, now what do we do?
    We write one. Scary? No, it will be a lot of fun. Writing low-level code is not
    your thing? No sweat, somebody already did it for you. There is a whole community
    writing code for node.js that everybody else can use. That code is made available
    as what is referred to as **modules**, and of course there is a HTTP module available
    to us.

    user typed and explore the **file system** to see whether there is a physical
    file, for example, an `hello.html` file, and serve it up back to the client. We
    will have to write that too. This is cool because it will give us full control
    over what exactly our web server should be able to handle and what it shouldn't.
    As expected, there are `url` and `fs` modules for node.js as well.

    code? This is where *Express* fits in. It is a framework for node.js that will
    help us write cleaner, more compact code. This is our jQuery on the server side.

    or portions thereof. So PHP code, often embedded inside HTML code in a file with
    `.php` as an extension, is executed on the server and what is rendered by the
    browser is pure HTML. You also learned how to generate HTML from a separate PHP
    file or even JavaScript on the client side, using data that comes from the server,
    and then inject it into a portion of a web page (Ajax).

- en: Combining PHP and HTML and even a small chunk of client-side JavaScript inside
    a single file was made possible thanks to the `<script>` tag and by putting PHP
    code in between `<?php` and `?>`. That is why they sometimes call PHP a *templating*
    language.

    JavaScript code in between `<script>` tags, but what about the server JavaScript
    code? There is no such thing as `<?javascript ?>` because this is not how node.js
    works.

- en: Node.js and Express support several templating languages that allow you to separate
    layout and content and have the template system do the work to go fetch the content
    and inject it into the HTML. As we no longer want to learn yet another language,
    we decided to go with **handlebars.js**, as it uses plain HTML to define your
    layout, that you already learned some 12 chapters ago. The default templating
    language for Express appears to be **Jade**, which uses its own, albeit more compact,
    because there are no tags, format. Another advantage of using handlebars.js is
    that is also available to do client-side templating.

    To use handlebars in node and Express, there are several modules available. I
    like the one with the easy to remember name **express-handlebars**. If you search
    the web for handlebars.js, you will find the library to do client-side templating.

    node.js, you can use JavaScript across the board, on both the client and server
    side. You can even write your own web server with just a few lines of code. As
    you only include the things you really need, you can obtain far better performance
    with this *avant-garde* way of doing web development.

    handlebars.js. This is a better way to separate layout from dynamic content and
    have the framework combine the two, so the browser can render it as a view. For
    that purpose, we concluded the chapter by writing a layout in HTML.
