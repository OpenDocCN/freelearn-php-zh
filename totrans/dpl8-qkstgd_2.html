<p>We all know what content is...sort of. This book is made up of content. This chapter contains content, as does this section within this chapter. The more important question is: what is it in the context of Drupal? This question is best answered with the home page as an example, because you'll know it when you see it!</p>
<p><span>The following screenshot shows</span> a piece of content that I added to the site, in the main content area, with a thick rectangle around it:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-307 image-border" src="assets/0788ca76-855e-4f83-bb41-050febe63f33.png" style="width:162.50em;height:58.83em;"/></p>
<p>When rendered and displayed in the browser, it's simply content, but up until that point, it is content of a certain type, of a content type, also known in Drupal as a node bundle. Does Drupal look at this content simply as:</p>

We all know what content is ... sort of. This book is made up of content. This chapter contains content, as does this section within the chapter. The more important question is, what is it in the context of Drupal? The question is best answered with the home page as an example, because you'll know it when you see it.</span></p>
<p>No, content is stored within Drupal in a way that facilitates selecting it based on almost any criteria you wish.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the database for a moment. This isn't something that you need to learn, but it's good for illustration purposes. If we were to look at the main identifying information for this piece of content within the Drupal database, we would see this:</p>
<pre>+-----+------+---------+--------------------------------------+----------+<br/>| nid | vid | type | uuid | langcode |<br/>+-----+------+---------+--------------------------------------+----------+<br/>| 1 | 3 | article | 6166dc8e-1c64-4897-807e-7c535934f616 | en |<br/>+-----+------+---------+--------------------------------------+----------+<kbd><br/></kbd></pre>
<p>You can see this in the <kbd>article</kbd> value in the <kbd>type</kbd> column, which contains the content type in this table. "Article" is the content type of our content. Let's leave the database behind and look at our content and its content type in the way that you will use it, via the <strong>user interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>).</p>
<div class="packt_tip">In the Drupal documentation, you will often find a URL specified in an abbreviated manner, omitting the domain name to avoid confusion since most users will be using different domain names, so instead of <kbd>mysite.com/page1</kbd> you might simply see <kbd>/page1</kbd>. </div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>One of the pages used most often by a content editor is the content administration page.</span> We'll begin there by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Content</span> link in the admin menu, which will take us to <kbd>admin/content</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9f35b958-fa10-4486-9819-02a460302a12.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, our content is listed, its title is on the left, and the type given is Article. We will learn more about the use of this page in <a href="5dc26faf-5b24-463c-9587-e06ec89742a7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating and Editing Content</em>, but for now we want to use it to lead us to the page on which we can edit our content. Let's click the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> link at the opposite end of the row from the content title, which will display a node edit form for the content, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>We sometimes tend to think of content as a big block of body text, but content can be stored as discreet fields so that important elements can be easily accessed and properly formatted:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b2bc21c0-395a-408b-a0e3-bb3e77a472ab.png"/></p>
<p>You can see the same content in this form as you did on the page. However, here you also see the fields that hold that content. The content title is in a field labeled <span class="packt_screen">Title</span>, and the main text is in a field labeled <span class="packt_screen">Body</span>. There are two additional fields that are not being used by this particular piece of content: a field for categories, labeled <span class="packt_screen">Tags</span>, and one that is used for attaching an image to the content, labeled <span class="packt_screen">Image</span>.</p>
<p>By having a Title field and a Body field, both the user and Drupal understand that the information in each is separate from the other. This doesn't mean that they cannot be displayed together, but there are many reasons why we may want to be able to differentiate them.</p>
<p>For example, when this content was displayed on the homepage, the title and the body text were formatted differently. Another example is that we might want to have Drupal provide us with a list of content titles. In both examples, it is important for Drupal to be able to determine which part of the content <em>is</em> the title. If all of the content in the piece was thrown together, there would be no way for Drupal to know where the title ends and the body text begins. Having them in separate fields removes any ambiguity.</p>
<p>So, we have seen what the content looks like when separated into separate fields. But where do the fields come from? How does Drupal know which fields to offer to receive our input? Let's take a look at that next.</p>

<p>A content type is essentially a collection of fields used to hold the various items that together form the whole of the content. In the case of the piece of content that we have been using, it is an example of the <span class="packt_screen">Article</span> content type, which is one of the two content types that are present when you first create a new Drupal site, with the other being the <span class="packt_screen">Page</span> content type.</p>
<p>If you think of a company's job application, every application contains the same fields for entering information, even though the information differs from one to another. In this example, the job application is a content type. Let's take a look at the Article content type in terms of how Drupal provides it.</p>
<p>To navigate via the admin menu, click <span class="packt_screen">Structure</span>. Then, on the next page, click <span class="packt_screen">Content types</span>, which will lead to a page that you can also reach via the browser instead at <kbd>/admin/structure/types</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>We'll now take a look at the content type definition. To start, rather than click on the default choice of <span class="packt_screen">Manage fields</span>, click the arrow next to that and select <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ebbdbf00-6faa-45cb-aef7-9a3796adead6.png"/></p>
<p>Let's take a brief look at the settings in the preceding form:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Name</span>: This is the plain language name that the content type will be identified with. In this case, this is <span class="packt_screen">Article</span>. To the right of this human-readable name is what is referred to as the <span class="packt_screen">Machine name</span>, which is the internal name. This is generated automatically by Drupal, and is usually the lowercase version of the name, with multiple words having spaces replaced by an underscore.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Description</span>: This is a place to describe the purpose of the content type and, perhaps,  rules of its usage. The descriptive text entered here will be displayed along with the content type name when given a list of available content types to choose from when creating content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these two fields is a series of vertical tabs that provide additional configuration items.</p>

<p>The submission form is the form with which content is created:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Title field label</span>: All content has some identifying key that also acts as a title when the content is displayed. The default is to refer to this value as the <em>Title</em>, but in some cases, this may not be appropriate. For example, with a content type that defines travel destinations, the title would work better as <em>Destination</em> or <em>Location</em> than <em>Title</em>. This field is required. Its value will be used as the prompt on the entry screen when creating a piece of content of this type.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Preview before submitting</span>: When creating or editing content, it is likely that the content, as viewed in the editor, will differ from the content as viewed on the web page. Previewing provides the latter view. The selection here will determine whether previewing is available, and if so, whether it will be optional or required to do so before submitting.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Explanation or submission guidelines</span>: This is simply a place to enter a description that will be shown to the person creating or editing the content.</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Typically, content is entered in a rich text editor window in a form. Since this entry can very well be the first draft of that content, it may not be desired to have it published immediately. Some content types will be of this type, more often than not, while others, such as one that contains only a title and URL, will not require more than one draft. Because of this, publishing options are provided. Here, in the content type form, the default choice for these options can be set:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><span class="packt_screen"> Published</span></em>: If selected, the content will be published as soon as it is saved</li>
<li><em><span class="packt_screen">Promoted to front page</span></em>: Not all content is necessarily intended for the homepage, and a piece of content having this value set, or not, can be used to determine whether it should appear there</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip">In Drupal, the site's homepage is sometimes referred to as the <em>front page</em>, like in a newspaper.</div>
<ul>
<li><em><span class="packt_screen">Sticky at top of lists</span></em>: When no other scheme is put in place, the front page displays a specified number of article teasers, and as more content is created, the older ones "drop" off the page. If a piece of content is meant to remain on the page while others cycle on and off, such as a welcome message, it can be accomplished by setting this value.</li>
<li><em><span class="packt_screen">Create new revision</span></em>: Imagine making changes to content, saving them, and realizing that something was changed that shouldn't have been. What do you do? The original version is gone! Or is it? When a new revision is created, it contains the content as it existed before the changes were made. Should the need arise, the current version can be reverted to that of the revision, providing a complete undo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, it is desirable to add a piece of content to a menu, particularly if it is somewhat static on the site. For example, Terms and Conditions would be persistent site content, whereas a notice about the current week's activities would not. The former might be one of a specific content type, perhaps <span class="packt_screen">Legal</span>, and you might desire that every piece of such content be listed in the <span class="packt_screen">Footer</span> menu. In this example, the <span class="packt_screen">Footer</span> within the list of <span class="packt_screen">Available menus</span> would be checked, and if there were a heading, <span class="packt_screen">Legal</span>, already in that menu, it could be selected as the <span class="packt_screen">Default parent item</span>. In that case, all content of that type would, by default, be added to the <span class="packt_screen">Footer</span> menu as child content to <span class="packt_screen">Legal</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c449d035-b48f-401a-bc7f-a98b5ecdd868.png" style="width:49.58em;height:15.42em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">More on menus will be found in Chapter 8.</div>
<p>That completes the main form for content types. We will be creating a new content type later in this chapter. For now, let's move on to managing content type fields.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A field can be thought of as a container that you put something in, that something in our context being content. Why do content types have fields rather than one big box in which to put the content, like a page in MS Word? Let's consider an example.</p>
<p>Suppose our content is related to appointments. Ms. Jones is making an appointment. One possibility is that the appointment is entered as text, like so:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>January 20 at 1:30 PM Ms. Jones will see Mr. Kim to discuss investments.</em></p>
<p>All of the information needed is there. However, what happens when a list is needed of all the appointments for the next two weeks? Or when a list of all Ms. Jones's appointments are needed? Or when a decision is made to change the date format on all appointments? In those cases, having the information in a form that is difficult to aggregate, search, or edit globally is problematic.</p>
<p>What if the appointments were stored like a spreadsheet?</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Date/Time</td>
<td>Client</td>
<td>Seeing</td>
<td>Reason</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>January 20, 2018</span></td>
<td>Ms. Jones</td>
<td>Mr. Kim</td>
<td>Investment discussion</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With the information segregated into meaningful pieces, it is much easier to find what is needed and edit it. That is the idea behind fields. </p>
<p>We've been working with the <span class="packt_screen">Article</span> content type. Let's take a look at how its fields are defined. At the top of the current page, we'll click on the <span class="packt_screen">Manage</span> <span class="packt_screen">fields</span> tab:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ba4fab96-d35c-4135-ae52-183c3af3d111.png" style="width:46.42em;height:25.67em;"/></p>
<p>We saw the title field on the content type form. This screen is for optional fields. There could be no additional fields for the content type at all, but since all content types must have a title field, whatever its label, it isn't included here.</p>
<p>When we looked at the content edit form, we saw the title and body fields. The body field is listed here. The field is of a type meant to hold text without any specific use or format in mind. We'll be looking more at field types when we create a new content type later in this chapter. </p>
<p>The comments field is meant to hold a comment about the content. There may be several instances of this field, one for each comment created. A comment is actually a content entity type on its own, and so even though the comments are seen when viewing the article's content, the actual contents of the comment field is simply the ID of the comment.</p>
<p>The image field is used for displaying an image along with the content, allowing an image to be uploaded. The image field is a reference of the information needed to retrieve the actual image from where it is stored, and the article image field, if an image is being used, will contain the address of that record.</p>
<p>The final field is for tags. Think of tags as categorical information that can be used for searching for the content. This is using another reference field type like comments and images, that is, taxonomy. We will be looking at taxonomy more in Chapter 7. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="packt_infobox"><em>Taxonomy</em> is a content structure, referred to as an <em>Entity</em> in Drupal. Another type of entity is a <em>User</em>. <span>Article is a content type, also known as a <em>Bundle</em>, which is a sub-type of an Entity type known as a <em>Node</em>. Bundles can include Article, Page, Blog post, and other types of content that's intended for readers.</span></div>
<p>We can look at the other two tabs at the top of the page, <span class="packt_screen">Manage form display</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Manage display</span> when we create a content type. In fact, let's do that now!</p>

<p>We've already taken a look at the <em>Article</em> content type. It contains a title and a place to enter text, and allows the addition of an image and category tags. So, with all that, why would you want to create a content type? Well, because vanilla is a nice flavor, but not the <span class="underline">only</span> flavor!</p>
<p>We need an appointment list. Well, not really, but we're going to need an example of a type of content that is nothing like an article, and an appointment is a good example of that. </p>
<p>The first thing to do after determining that a new content type is needed is designing it. Looking back at the Article content type, it had settings and fields. So will this one. It helps to decide in advance what those will be in order to create a design, so let's do that. We'll use two forms for the design <span>–</span> nothing fancy, just lists to refer to when entering information into the content type forms.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>With this content type, we will pretend that we are in an office that gives appointments to its clients. The content type <em>Name</em> and <em>Description</em> values are self-evident.</p>
<p>The <em>Title field</em> label will be Name, since it will contain the name of the person who has the appointment.</p>
<p>The selected Default options will be <em>Published</em> and <em>Revision</em>. We are selecting <em>Published</em> because we want appointments to be active and set as soon as they are saved. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><em>Promoted</em> is not set because we don't want the appointments to be displayed on the front page like an article, nor do we want the most recently entered appointment to be the one shown. We will want the appointment nearest to the current date and time to be shown. </p>
<p><em>Sticky</em> is not set because we have no need for any appointment to remain on the front page.</p>
<p>Finally, we do set <em>Create new revision</em>, so that any time an appointment is changed, Drupal will save the previous version rather than simply overwriting it.</p>
<p>We will make no changes to the default settings on the other tabs since they meet our needs, and so they do not appear in the list. With our list complete, on the administrative menu, we can click <em><span class="packt_screen">Structure</span></em>, then <em><span class="packt_screen">Content types</span></em>, and then the <em><span class="packt_screen">+Add content type</span></em> button, which will lead us to the page at <kbd>/admin/structure/types/add</kbd>. Once there, enter the information from the form, and after ensuring that the <em>Default options</em> settings are as they should be, as shown in the following form, click the <em><span class="packt_screen">Save and manage fields</span></em> button:</p>

<p>So far, we have created the <em>Appointment</em> content type. At this point, it could be used for creating content. However, it is not yet constructed to fulfil its purpose. It only has two fields, one being the title, Name, and the other a field for body text, of which there will be none with this content type. We will need to do a little work to make this content type usable for our purpose.</p>
<p>In order to add the necessary fields to the content type, it would be helpful to know what the choices are.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Our content type field</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You can see from the preceding lists, there are fields for most of the various types of information that you will need to store. It's not just a matter of the type of data, like text or number, but often what information the data represents, like a phone number or URL, and that's because there is often programming code that provides the formatting or validates what has been entered. For example, entering an email address in a phone number field will cause an error to be displayed.</p>
<p>So, let's take a look at a list of the information  that we will want to store for an appointment, and the type of field that we can use for that. We'll also decide on a name for each field, which will be used for its label on the entry form, and help text with a a description to remind us or inform other users about the field's use:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr style="background-color: #cbd4f7">
<th>Information needed</th>
<th>Field type</th>
<th>Label</th>
<th>Help Text</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client name</td>
<td>text  (plain)</td>
<td>Name<sup>1</sup></td>
<td/>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client phone number</td>
<td>text (plain)<sup>2</sup></td>
<td>Phone</td>
<td><kbd>###-###-####</kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client email address</td>
<td>email</td>
<td>Email</td>
<td>For example, <kbd>bill@gmail.com</kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Appointment date and time</td>
<td>date</td>
<td>Date</td>
<td/>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Who the appointment is with</td>
<td>list (text)</td>
<td>With</td>
<td>Select a name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The purpose of the appointment</td>
<td>text (plain, long)</td>
<td>Reason</td>
<td/>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The status of the appointment</td>
<td>list (text)</td>
<td>Status</td>
<td>Select a status</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><sup>1</sup> This is the renamed Title field</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> There is a field type for telephone number, but it is not enabled, so we will use plain text</p>
<p>With our list prepared, it's time to create the fields for our content type. </p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding fields to the content type</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Still on the <span class="packt_screen">Manage</span> <em>fields</em> page (<kbd>/admin/structure/types/manage/appointment/fields</kbd>), let's first make a change to the one existing field: Body. We will not have body text in this content type, so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the arrow next to <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span></li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Delete</span></li>
<li>confirm the deletion</li>
</ol>
<p>With that done, click the <em><span class="packt_screen">+Add field</span></em> button.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We'll add the fields shown in the preceding order for the most part. The page we see now has two dropdown select widgets: one for creating a new field, and one for reusing a field on this content type that already exists. </p>
<p>Keeping in mind that the Name field already exists in our content type, being the renamed Title field that all content types contain, the first field we will add is Client phone number:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <em><span class="packt_screen">Add a new field</span></em> dropdown</li>
<li>Scroll down and select <em><span class="packt_screen">Text (plain)</span></em> from the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>A new field, <em><span class="packt_screen">Label</span></em>, appears, and is marked with a red asterisk, indicating that it is required that you type something in the field:</p>
<ul>
<li>The label, as found in our preceding table, will be <strong>Phone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Having entered the label, you will notice that to the right of the field that a <em><span class="packt_screen">Machine name</span></em> appears. The machine name is the name by which Drupal will identify the field. Once you save the field, the label can be changed at any time, but the field name will not change, because it will already have been <em>set in stone</em> within the database. Were you to desire a specific machine name, now is the time it can be changed, by clicking the <em><span class="packt_screen">Edit</span></em> link. You would be able to edit the name, keeping in mind that there are some naming rules, such as needing to use underscores rather than hyphens, and that the <strong>field_</strong> prefix cannot be removed. We have no need to override the field name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <em><span class="packt_screen">Save and continue</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>A new page is loaded, which is for defining the field storage. Fields in Drupal have three components: the <em>definition</em>, which describes the field, the <em>storage</em>, which defines how the field will be stored in the database, and the actual <em>contents</em> of the field for a given piece of content, when that content is created.</p>
<p>The first field is <em><span class="packt_screen">Maximum length</span></em>, and is required. For this field type, a standard (as opposed to long) text field is desired. The default is 255, meaning that the field can hold up to 255 characters. It's alright if less are entered when the content is created. You need only change this value if the contents should be of a particular length and no more. In the case of the phone field, it depends. If all client contacts will be local, or at least domestic, then it would be alright to limit the length to match the structure of your phone numbers. For example, in the U.S., phone numbers are ten digits. That said, the length of such a phone number can be greater than ten digits if entered with a format such as (212) 555-1212. So, be careful when limiting the length. We'll just leave it at 255.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The <em><span class="packt_screen">Allowed number of values</span></em> field defines whether a piece of content, an appointment in this case, can contain more than one occurrence of this field. We have the option to leave it as <strong>Limited</strong> to one value, or change the number to another specific quantity, or click the dropdown widget and selecting <strong>Unlimited</strong> to indicated any number of instances of this field can be created. We want to be able to take two contact numbers for the client in case the need to contact them arises and attempts of using the first number are not successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the 1 to 2</li>
<li>Click <em><span class="packt_screen">Save field settings</span></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The third, and final, page in the field creation process is now displayed. If we want to change the storage settings that we just saved, we could click the <span class="packt_screen">Field settings</span> tab and do so.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>The storage settings for a field can not be changed once content has been created that uses that field, unless all such content is first deleted. Attempts to click this tab after content has been created will result in a display of the settings with a message indicating that they can no longer be changed due to content existing.</span></div>
<p>The first field in the form is for the <em><span class="packt_screen">Label</span></em>. This is the value that we entered earlier. It can be changed now if we have since decided on a new name. The <em><span class="packt_screen">Machine name</span></em> can no longer be changed.</p>
<p>The contents of the <em><span class="packt_screen">Help text</span></em> field, if any, will be displayed on the content form beneath the field you are creating. We'll use the entry from our table to provide the content creator with a hint as to the field contents, which in our case is the format of the phone number used locally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter <span><strong>###-###-####</strong> in the <em><span class="packt_screen">Help Text</span></em> field</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Help Text</span> field can contain HTML, as indicated by its own help text. For example, we could elaborate on our description by instead entering the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Enter a phone number with the format &lt;strong&gt;###-###-####&lt;/strong&gt;</p>
<p>Which would be displayed as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Enter a phone number with the format <strong><span>###-###-####</span></strong></p>
<p>The next field in the form is the <em><span class="packt_screen">Required</span></em> field. If this box is checked, the field will appear in the content form with its label containing whatever formatting is defined for a required field in the site theme. By default, this would be a red asterisk, as we see in the current form beside <em><span class="packt_screen">Label</span></em>. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="packt_tip">If a field is required, content cannot be saved unless a value has been provided for the field. Be careful not to require a field that could legitimately be left empty. Examples of this are a zip code or post code for an optional address, a list of options where none may apply, or a checkbox, where empty indicates "no".</div>
<p>In our case, we will leave the phone field as not being required. The final field is for a default value. Of course, a phone number field is unlikely to have a default value, given that we have no idea what the value will be. There are circumstances where a default value makes sense. For example, if we have a grouping of address fields, one of which is Country, and if most of the entries will be from the United Kingdom, it would make sense to offer it as a default value rather than forcing the user to scroll down a list of countries to the U's. </p>
<div class="packt_tip">If you provide a default value, be prepared for erroneous content due to users accidentally leaving the field untouched and saving the form with the default value. </div>
<p>We will leave the form containing no default value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <em><span class="packt_screen">Save settings</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we have saved our first field configuration, <em><span class="packt_screen">Phone</span></em>. Technically, the field does not exist until content is created using this field, but its definition and configuration exist at this point. You can see that our content type field list for the <em><span class="packt_screen">Appointment</span></em> content type has changed, with <em>field_phone</em> having been added to it.</p>
<p>We will follow the same process for each of the remaining fields in our table. For each of them, I note any considerations for their storage and configuration settings, as follows:</p>
<p><em>Date</em>: <em><span class="packt_screen">date</span></em> field type <span>–</span> the checkbox for <em><span class="packt_screen">Required</span></em> should be checked.</p>
<p><em>With</em>: <em><span class="packt_screen">list (text)</span></em> field type <span>–</span> in the <em><span class="packt_screen">Allowed values list</span></em> box, add 2-3 names in the form last name, first name, one person per line. As an example, I have added the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Jones, Janet</strong><br/>
<strong>Smith, Steve</strong></p>
<p><em>Status:</em> <em><span class="packt_screen">list (text)</span></em> field type <span>– </span>in the <em><span class="packt_screen">Allowed values list</span></em> box, add the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>pending</strong><br/>
<strong>active</strong><br/>
<strong>canceled</strong><br/>
<strong>completed</strong></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>And in the <em>Default Value</em> dropdown, select <strong>pending</strong>.</p>
<p>Having created all of the fields in our table, the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Fields</span> page should look as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ad74ad15-1ddd-4297-9a1a-07bf4369f101.png"/></p>

<p>In this chapter, we have learned the following: firstly, what a content type is, and then why we would want to create one. Furthermore, we looked at content fields, found out what they are, and looked at what field types are available. Then, we moved on and looked at how to design and create content types, before finally finishing by adding fields to our content types.</p>
<ul>
<li>What a content type is</li>
<li>Why we would want to create a content type</li>
<li>What content type fields are</li>
<li>Which field types are available</li>
<li>How to design a content type</li>
<li>How to create a content type</li>
<li>How to add fields to the content type</li>
</ul>
<p>We will return to our content type later in this book when we learn about creating content for it, configuring the content creation form, and designing the way the content is displayed.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="packt_tip">We added fields to a new content type in this chapter. It is also possible, using the same administrative pages, to edit existing content types and add new fields to them, change existing fields, and remove fields that are no longer needed.</div>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about administering users, their roles, and the permissions assigned to those roles.</p>
