    for your website is that you are able to change the look and feel of your website
    without being knowledgeable about HTML and CSS. Almost every CMS allows users
    to customize the look of their website without having to worry about their content
    being changed. These managed looks are referred to as themes. On other platforms
    (for example, Blogger, Joomla, and Drupal), themes are sometimes called **templates** or **layouts**.

    free, whereas some charge a small fee. Of course, if you cannot find a free theme
    that fits your needs, you can always hire a theme developer to create a customized
    theme for you, or you can be your own theme developer (see [Chapter 9](eb8f8110-a317-4b1f-afd4-b2bf72714b39.xhtml)*,

    In short, when using them, you are encouraged to modify the theme files directly,
    and effectively make them the foundation of the theme you''re currently building.
    As the name suggests, they provide a great starting point for your own theme to
    be built upon. They are a great solution for developers, but not so much for regular
    users, who just want to download a great theme and be able to use it right out

    is that when you get a starter theme, you must put work into it beforehand to
    make the theme functional. With frameworks, you get a functional theme right away,
    but then you are expected to spend time tweaking its various elements to make
    it fit your site hand-in-glove. The thing with both theme frameworks and starter
    themes is that they are usually highly code-heavy products, which means that you
    can't really take full advantage of them if you don't possess any programming
    skills or don't have anyone on your payroll who does. This may not sound that
    clear right now, and that's okay. We will explain this concept some more in the
    following chapters.

    official directory is free, the rest of the internet is split in half on this.
    Some sites provide free themes exclusively, while others offer paid ones exclusively.
    There are also a number of distributors who sit in-between. I, personally, don't
    advise getting any free themes from anywhere other than either the official directory
    or one of the respected theme stores (which offer some free themes by way of a
    promotion).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason is simple. Only quality themes are allowed into the official directory,
    and I'm not just talking about the looks or the design. What matters, apart from
    the design, is also the code structure and code quality. There's no single theme
    that features any mysterious blocks of code (such as encrypted code or suspicious
    external links) that will ever find its way into the official directory. That's
    what ultimately makes the official directory one of the best sources of free WordPress
    themes on the web.

    is quite similar. The *first league* of WordPress themes, so to speak, consists
    of respected, serious companies. So, even when they release a free theme, they
    can't afford it being low quality or lacking in any other way. Therefore, in most
    cases, they are safe to use as well.

    advise you to get any of those, even if the designs are attractive. The fact is
    that you''ll never know what sits on the inside and what security breaches can
    be taken advantage of to hack into such a theme. They are also almost never supported

    The only bad news is that you can't know for sure whether a theme is a modern
    one or not. You can only rely on the details provided by the theme seller. But
    as bad as it sounds, it's actually not that big of a problem, because serious
    theme stores can't afford to lie in their marketing materials. So, whenever you
    see a message that the theme is *compatible with WordPress version X.X*, it's
    most likely true. Additionally, with WordPress 5 being released, and all the significant
    changes it brought to the table (compared to the previous versions), it's important
    to use only themes that have been verified to work with WordPress 5.

    it. Nevertheless, if you're getting your theme from the official directory at [https://wordpress.org/themes/](https://wordpress.org/themes/),

    remember all of what we've just covered, but this is work that will surely pay
    off. Let's not forget that you're probably going to use that theme for at least
    a year or two (a common scenario), so you surely don't want to spend money on
    a low-quality product.

    Underscores uses a pretty straightforward model. All you need to do is input the
    name that you want to use for your theme in the field at [https://underscores.me/](https://underscores.me/) (it
    can be whatever name you wish). Then, after clicking on GENERATE, you''ll get
