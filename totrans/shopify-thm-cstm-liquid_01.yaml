- en: In this section, we'll go through some theoretical knowledge around Shopify,
    theme structure, creating a development store, and working on a theme. After familiarizing
    ourselves with Shopify, we will start learning about Liquid, how its syntax works,
    and how we can use logical and comparison operators to manipulate the various
    data types that we have at our disposal.
