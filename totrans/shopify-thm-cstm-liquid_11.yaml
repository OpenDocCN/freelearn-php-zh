- en: In the previous chapters, we learned about the basics of Shopify and Liquid,
    which provided us with some solid groundwork for future development. After setting
    up a proper foundation for our future learning, we learned how Liquid core works.
    By learning about objects, tags, and filters, we have learned how to create complex
    functionalities using a somewhat simple and insignificant set of features. Lastly,
    we learned how to create easily configurable elements throughout the store using
    various input type settings, combined with the `sections` and `blocks` attributes.

    content. *However, what if we were looking to update the content of our pages
    dynamically?* This is where the Shopify Ajax API comes to help. In this final
    chapter, we will go over the Shopify Ajax API, explain its requirements and limitations,
    as well as its possible use cases.

    to exchange small amounts of data with the server and update the parts of any
    page, without the need to reload it in its entirety. *So, what exactly is the
    Shopify Ajax API?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Shopify Ajax API is a REST API endpoint through which we can send out requests
    to read or update certain information. For example, we can use a **GET** request
    to read the product or even the current cart data, or we can use a **POST** request
    to update the current content session of the cart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shopify Ajax is an unauthenticated API, which means that it does not require
    any tokens or API keys to gain access to store information. Shopify also provides
    us with an authenticated API named the **Shopify Admin API**, which apps and services
    use to communicate with Shopify servers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through the Shopify API, we can access most of our store data, whose responses
    will return JSON-formatted data, though we can't read customer and order data
    or update any store data – we can only do this using the Shopify Admin API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that Shopify has certain rate limitations regarding the Ajax API to prevent
    abuse (sending an unlimited number of requests to Shopify servers). One such limitation
    is that there's a maximum input array size limit, currently limited to 250\. Let's
    say that we are looking to pull information about all the products in a collection
    of over 1,000 products. We will have to use multiple queries to achieve this since
    we are limited to a maximum of 250 products per query.

    Ajax API and learned about different types of use cases. First, we learned how
    to upgrade the current purchase flow using the `/cart/add.js` endpoint, through
    which we can add any number of products, quantities, and line item customizations,
    whether they are public or private, directly to the current cart session.
