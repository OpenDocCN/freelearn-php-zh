<p>Drupal 8 provides a new, unified system to manage configurations. In Drupal 8, all configurations are saved in configuration entities that match a defined configuration schema. This system provides a standard way of deploying the configuration between Drupal site environments and updating the site configuration.</p>
<p>Once the configuration is created, or imported, it goes into an immutable state. If a module tries to install the configuration that exists, it will throw an exception and be prevented. Outside the typical user interface, the configuration can only be modified through the configuration management system.</p>
<p>The configuration management system can be manipulated through a user interface provided by the Configuration management module or through the command-line interface tools. These tools allow you to follow the development paradigm of utilizing a production site and a development site, where changes are made to the development site and then pushed to production.</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox">Instead of creating two different Drupal sites for the recipes in this chapter, you can utilize the Drupal multisite functionality. For more information on this functionality, refer to the <em>Installing Drupal</em> recipe of <span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="f6d2ba3b-f85a-45e4-ac1d-35b6fba84240.xhtml"><em>Chapter 1</em></a>, <em>Up and Running with Drupal 8</em></span>. Note that if you use a multisite, you will need to clone your development site's database into the site acting as your production site to replicate a realistic development and production site workflow.</div>

<p>Configuration management in Drupal 8 provides a solution to common problems when working with a website across multiple environments. No matter what the workflow pattern is, at some point, the configuration needs to move from one place to another, such as from production to a local environment. When pushing the development work to production, you will need to have some way to put the configuration in place.</p>
<p>Drupal 8's user interface provides a way to import and export configuration entities via the YAML format. In this recipe, we will create a content type, export its configuration, and then import it into another Drupal site. The configuration YAML export will be imported into the production site to update its configuration.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, configurations are just a mapping of keys and values, which can be represented as a PHP array and translated into the YAML format.</p>
<p>Configuration management uses schema definitions for configuration entities. The schema definition provides a configuration namespace and the available keys and data types. The schema definition provides a typed data definition for each option that allows validation of the individual values and configuration.</p>
<p>The export process reads the configuration data and translates it into the YAML format. The configuration manager then receives the configuration in the form of YAML and converts it back to a PHP array. The data is then updated in the database.</p>
<p>When importing the configuration, Drupal checks the value of the configuration YAML's <kbd>uuid</kbd> key, if present, against any current configuration with the same <strong>Universally Unique Identifier</strong> (<strong>UUID</strong>). A UUID is a pattern used in software to provide a method of identifying an object across different environments. This allows Drupal to correlate a piece of data from its UUID since the database identifier can differ across environments. If the configuration item has a matching machine name, but a mismatching UUID, an error will be thrown.</p>

Instead of manually writing configuration <kbd>YAML</kbd> files for installation, the <kbd>Configuration management</kbd> module can be used to export configurations and save them in your module's <kbd>config/install</kbd> directory.</p>
<p>Any item exported through the user interface can be used. The only requirement is that you will need to remove the <kbd>uuid</kbd> key, as it denotes the site's UUID value and invalidates the configuration when it tries to install it.</p>

<p>The configuration management system in Drupal 8 utilizes the configuration schema to describe configurations that can exist. Why is this important? It allows Drupal to properly implement typed data on stored configuration values and validate them, providing a standardized way of handling configurations for translation and configuration items.</p>
<p>When a module uses the configuration system to store data, it needs to provide a schema for each configuration definition it wishes to store. The schema definition is used to validate and provide typed data definitions for its values.</p>
<p>The following code defines the configuration schema for the <kbd>navbar_awesome</kbd> module, which holds two different Boolean configuration values:</p>
<pre>navbar_awesome.toolbar: 
  type: config_object 
  label: 'Navbar Awesome toolbar settings' 
  mapping: 
    cdn: 
      type: boolean 
      label: 'Use the FontAwesome CDN library' 
    roboto: 
      type: boolean 
      label: 'Include Roboto from Google Fonts CDN' </pre>
<p>This defines the <kbd>navbar_awesome.toolbar</kbd> configuration namespace; it belongs to the <kbd>navbar_awesome</kbd> module and has the <kbd>toolbar</kbd> configuration. We will then need two <kbd>cdn</kbd> and <kbd>roboto</kbd> subvalues that represent typed data values. A configuration YAML for this schema will be named <kbd>navbar_awesome.toolbar.yml</kbd> after the namespace, and it contains the following code:</p>
<pre>cdn: true 
roboto: true </pre>
<p>In turn, this is what the values will look like when represented as a PHP array:</p>
<pre>[ 
  'navbar_awesome' =&gt; [ 
    'cdn' =&gt; TRUE, 
    'roboto' =&gt; TRUE, 
  ] 
] </pre>
<p>The configuration factory classes then provide an object-based wrapper around these configuration definitions and provide validation of their values against the schema. For instance, if you try to save the <kbd>cdn</kbd> value as a string, a validation exception will be thrown.</p>

<p>A key component for managing a Drupal website is configuration integrity. A key part of maintaining this integrity is ensuring that your configuration changes made in development are pushed upstream to your production environments. Maintaining configuration changes by manually exporting and importing through the user interface can be tedious and does not provide a way to track what has or has not been exported or imported. At the same time, manually writing module hooks to manipulate the configuration can be time-consuming. Luckily, the configuration management solution provides you with the ability to export and import the entire site's configuration.</p>
<p>A site export can only be imported into another copy of itself. Each site must have the same UUID, which is set during its installation. This allows you to export your local development environment's configuration and bring it to staging or production, without modifying the content or the database directly.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will export the development site's complete configuration entities' definitions. We will then take the exported configuration and import it into the production site. This will simulate a typical deployment of a Drupal site with changes created in development that is ready to be released in production.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Configuration synchronization</span> form provides a way to interface with the <kbd>config</kbd> database table for your Drupal site. When you go to the <span class="packt_screen">Export</span> page and create the tarball, Drupal effectively dumps the contents of the <kbd>config</kbd> table. Each row represents a configuration entity and will become its own <kbd>YAML</kbd> file. The contents of the <kbd>YAML</kbd> file represent its database value.</p>
<p>When you import the tarball, Drupal extracts its content. The files are placed in the available <kbd>CONFIG_SYNC_DIRECTORY</kbd> directory. The synchronization page parses the configuration entity YAML and provides a difference check against the current site's configuration. Each configuration item can be reviewed, and then all the items can be imported. You cannot choose to selectively import individual items.</p>

<p>When a Drupal site is installed, the UUID is set. This UUID is added to the exported configuration entities and is represented by the <kbd>uuid</kbd> key. Drupal uses this key to identify the source of the configuration. Drupal will not synchronize configurations that do not have a matching UUID in their YAML definition.</p>
<p>You can review the site's current UUID value by reviewing the <kbd>system.site</kbd> configuration object. This can also be done using the Drush or Drupal Console command-line tool.</p>
<p>Using Drush, type the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ drush config-get system.site</strong></pre>
<p>Using Drupal Console, type the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ drupal debug:config system.site</strong></pre>

If you have not defined this in the global <kbd>$config_directories</kbd> variable in your site's <kbd>settings.php</kbd>, then it will be a randomly named directory in your site's file directory.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">When Drupal 8 entered its beta release cycle, this folder was referenced as a staging folder and referenced by the <kbd>CONFIG_STAGING_DIRECTORY</kbd>. This is now deprecated; however, the internals of the configuration management system support reading <kbd>CONFIG_STAGING_DIRECTORY</kbd> as <kbd>CONFIG_SYNC_DIRECTORY</kbd>. This will be removed in Drupal 9.</div>
<p>The synchronization form will use the configuration management discovery service to look for configuration changes that need to be imported from this folder.</p>

<p>Drupal's configuration management system will not allow the import of configuration entities that originated at a different Drupal site. When a Drupal site is installed, the <kbd>system.site</kbd> configuration entity saves a UUID for the current site instance. Only cloned versions of this site's database can accept configuration imports from it.</p>
<p>The configuration installer profile is a custom distribution, that will allow you to import the configuration despite the configuration's site UUID. The profile doesn't install itself. When you use the profile, it will provide an interface to upload a configuration export that will then be imported, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Drupal 8's configuration systems solve many problems encountered when exporting and deploying configurations in Drupal 7. However, the task of synchronizing the configuration is still a user interface task and requires the manipulation of archive files that contain the configuration exports for a Drupal 8 site.</p>
<p>Configuration management can be done on the command line through Drush, without requiring it to be installed. This mitigates any requirement to log in to the production website to import changes. It also opens the ability for more advanced workflows that place the configuration in version control.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will use Drush to export the development site's configuration to the filesystem. The exported configuration files will then be copied to the production site's configuration directory. Using Drush, the configuration will be imported into production to complete the deployment.</p>

<p>The <strong>Drush</strong> command-line tool can utilize the code found in Drupal to interact with it. The <kbd>config-export</kbd> command replicates the functionality provided by the <kbd>Configuration management</kbd> module's full site export. However, you do not need the Configuration management module enabled for the command to work. The command will extract the available site configuration and write it to a directory, which is unarchived.</p>
<p>The <kbd>config-import</kbd> command parses the files in a directory. It will make an attempt to run a difference check against the YAML files like the Configuration management module's synchronize overview form does. It will then import all the changes.</p>

<p>Drush provides a way to simplify the transportation of configuration between sites. The <kbd>config-pull</kbd> command allows you to specify two Drupal sites and move the export configuration between them. You can either specify a name of a subdirectory under the <kbd>/sites</kbd> directory or a Drush alias.</p>
<p>The following command will copy a development site's configuration and import it into the staging server's site:</p>
<pre><strong>drush config-pull @mysite.local @mysite.staging</strong> </pre>
<p>Additionally, you can specify the <kbd>--label</kbd> option. This represents a folder key in the <kbd>$config_directories</kbd> setting. The option defaults to <kbd>sync</kbd> automatically. Alternatively, you can use the <kbd>--destination</kbd> parameter to specify an arbitrary folder that is not specified in the setting of <kbd>$config_directories</kbd>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Drush has been part of the Drupal community since Drupal 4.7 and is a custom-built command-line tool. The Drupal Console is a Symfony Console-based application used to interact with Drupal. The Drupal Console project provides a means for configuration management over the command line.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can learn more about the Drupal Console in <a href="099b7376-2149-4af8-9649-45445745f068.xhtml"><em><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 13</span></em></a>, <em>Drupal CLI</em> or at <a href="http://www.drupalconsole.com/"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.drupalconsole.com/</span></a>.</div>
<p>The workflow is the same, except the naming of the command. The configuration export command is <kbd>config:export</kbd>, and it is automatically exported to your system's temporary folder until a directory is passed. You can then import the configuration using the <kbd>config:import</kbd> command.</p>

<p>Both Drush and Drupal Console support the ability to edit the configuration through the command line in YAML format. Both the tools operate in the same fashion and have similar command names:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drush</strong>: <kbd>config-edit [name]</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Console</strong>: <kbd>config:edit [name]</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>The difference is that Drush will list all the available options to be edited if you do not pass a name, while Console allows you to search.</p>
<p>When you edit a configuration item, your default terminal-based text editor will open. You will be presented with a <kbd>YAML</kbd> file that can be edited. Once you save your changes, the configuration is then saved on your Drupal site:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Both Drush and Console provide their own mechanisms for exporting a single configuration entity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drush</strong>: <kbd>config-get [name]</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Console</strong>: <kbd>config:debug [name]</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Drush will print the configuration's output to the terminal, whereas Console's default behavior is to write the output to the file disk. For example, the following commands will output the values from <kbd>system.site</kbd> in the YAML format:</p>
<pre><strong>$ drush config-get system.site 
$ drupal debug:config system.site </strong></pre>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/b90942f1-1639-4071-be6a-7c6831bcef3c.png"/></div>

            <article>
                
<p>A benefit of having the configuration exportable to YAML files is the fact that the configuration can be kept in version control. The Drupal site's <kbd>CONFIG_SYNC_DIRECTORY</kbd> directory can be committed to version control to ensure that it is transported across environments and properly updated. Deployment tools can then use Drush or Console to automatically import changes.</p>
<p>The <kbd>config-export</kbd> command provided by Drush provides the Git integration:</p>
<pre><strong>drush config-export --add </strong> </pre>
<p>Appending the <kbd>--add</kbd> option will run <kbd>git add -p</kbd> for an interactive staging of the changed configuration files:</p>
<pre><strong>drush config-export --commit --message="Updating configuration "</strong> </pre>
<p>The <kbd>--commit</kbd> and optional <kbd>--message</kbd> options will stage all configuration file changes and commit them with your message:</p>
<pre><strong>drush config-export --push --message="Updating configuration " </strong> </pre>
<p>Finally, you can also specify <kbd>--push</kbd> to make a commit and push it to the remote repository.</p>

<p>Modules in Drupal 8 provide configuration YAML files inside their <kbd>config/install</kbd> directory. A consequence of the site controlling configuration is that a new configuration in a module's <kbd>config/install</kbd> directory is not automatically installed. Module developers must write update functions, which will import the new configuration as it is added. While this is a practice contributed modules should follow, this process can be cumbersome for private projects.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Drupal community has come up with a solution that provides a configuration management flow that allows updating of a module's provided default configuration. The module <strong>Configuration Update Manager</strong> allows you to import a new configuration from a module or revert it to the original configuration if modified. In fact, the module is a dependency for the Features module discussed in <span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="a634af62-2148-4382-9121-b8500df169ed.xhtml"><em>Chapter 4</em></a>, <em>Extending Drupal</em></span>.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will use Configuration Update Manager to review configuration differences to a module and revert the modified configuration.</p>

<p>The Configuration Update Manager provides two modules: <strong>Configuration Update Base</strong> and <strong>Configuration Update Reports</strong>. The base module provides an underlying API for listing a configuration, reverting a configuration, and running difference checks with results. It extends Drupal core's configuration operations. The reports module provides a user interface on top of the base module. The Features module uses the base module to provide difference review and automatic reverting of a configuration.</p>
<p>When reverting a configuration, the raw values are collected and then used to overwrite what currently exists in the system. The reports also allow importing a new configuration added to a module.</p>

<p>For module developers, there is the Configuration Development module. The Configuration Development module provides a command-line method for importing and exporting a configuration. This is useful for contributed module developers. It eases the exporting and update of a configuration intended for the <kbd>config/install</kbd> directory.</p>
<p>The module looks for a <kbd>config_devel</kbd> entry in the module's <kbd>info.yml</kbd> file. An example is taken from the Commerce Store submodule from Drupal Commerce module:</p>
<pre>config_devel: 
  install: 
    - commerce_store.commerce_store_type.online 
    - commerce_store.settings 
    - core.entity_view_display.commerce_store.online.default 
    - views.view.commerce_stores 
    - system.action.commerce_delete_store_action 
 </pre>
<p>Using Drush, commands provided by the Configuration Development can then be used to export and import the data. The following command will export the listed configuration to the <kbd>config/install</kbd> directory:</p>
<pre><strong>$ drush config-devel-export commerce_store</strong></pre>
