    system, or each other. They also allow learners to develop confidence by being
    rewarded with a badge or certificate when they complete the activities. Above
    all, course activities should connect to the learning objectives of the course
    and correspond to the appropriate level of knowledge in the cognitive domain,
    as indicated in Bloom's Taxonomy, which we reviewed in [*Chapter 4*](B17288_04_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318)*,
    Managing Resources, Activities, and Conditional Access*. Your instructional strategy
    will be very effective if you ensure that every step of your course planning integrates
    the learning objectives with the appropriate level of content and activities,
    as well as that each step has measurable outcomes. Your institution may have to
    undergo periodic reviews of its curriculum, instructional strategy, instructional
    delivery system (learning management system), materials, and assessments to maintain
    its accreditation or certification status. In addition to developing effective
    course content and assessments, this chapter will help you engage learners and
    allow them to persist in their studies to achieve their learning goals.

    objectives you select should clearly and concisely express the performative outcomes
    of your course. They will appear in the syllabus as well. Keep in mind that effective
    learning objectives use action verbs that tie to Bloom's Taxonomy, and they result
    in actions that are measurable and tie directly to the course unit or the entire
    course. Bloom's Taxonomy is arranged as a hierarchy, with the more fundamental
    outcomes such as **Identify forming** at the base and more complex and abstract
    ones such as **Create** at the top. Think of the different levels of the hierarchy
    as building blocks.

    as a building-block sequence of ever-increasing levels of complexity. Simply put,
    it is a hierarchy that helps you describe, map, and measure knowledge in the cognitive
    domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll start with the learning objectives. Bloom's Taxonomy is a pyramid; the
    base is the most foundational, and it has to do with remembering. So, we can start
    with learning objectives that have to do with remembering. For example, we can
    say, `Identify five places in the world that use geothermal energy`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As shown in *Figure 6.1*, we move up from the base of the pyramid to tasks of
    increasing complexity. Each task has affiliated verbs, which will make assessing
    and determining whether or not an individual achieved the learning objective much
    easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The top of the pyramid is **CREATING**. It is at the pinnacle of the hierarchy
    because it brings together the lower-domain cognitive activities and requires
    both synthesis and analysis. The learning objective for a course that will ascend
    as high as the sixth level will be easier than it may seem at first. The key is
    to consider an activity that will allow you, as the instructor, to properly evaluate
    or assess. For example, creating the corresponding activity could be to "develop
    a project" or "invent a new type of magazine":'

    to ensure consistency in schools and learning organizations. When that is the
    case, there is a special emphasis on assessments. Many times, they are standardized
    tests rather than essay tests or demonstration projects. Great care is taken in
    assuring that the exams are psychometrically valid since completing the exam means
    that a person has demonstrated competence or even mastery of the concepts.

    can deliver course content because they deliver bundles of content, including
    interactive material. In Moodle, an activity is something that has an element

    For example, if you're used to using Moodle 3.11 (or earlier) in MoodleCloud,
    you'll notice that three activities no longer appear. **Attendance**, **Checklist,**
    and **Custom Certificate** are gone. Don't worry! That doesn't mean that you can't
    figure out who has attended the course. You can find out in the activity log if
    you use a **Lesson**. As for **Checklist**, all the required activities and due
    dates will now automatically appear in the dashboard, which will integrate everything
    that has a deadline into the calendar. If you wish you could automatically generate
    certificates and you miss the **Custom Certificate** activity that was included
    in MoodleCloud's paid packages, don't worry. Moodle 4.0 has updated the **Badge**
    plugin, which makes it much easier to generate badges that can be displayed on
    your website, LinkedIn page, social media, and more.

    that can be uploaded into Moodle. If you require your learners to create a video,
    you may need to find another way for them to send you their large video files.
    You can ask learners to submit digital files uploaded to the cloud (Google, Dropbox,
    and so on), or you can ask them to create audio or video using a platform you
    can link to that the institution provides, such as Zoom or Teams, and then view
    the video or listen to the audio from that platform. Another option is for them
    to create a video and then upload it to their account on YouTube, and then link
    to it. This is a good time to mention that antivirus software may make the upload
    fail. Be sure to check with the site administrator to ensure that everything is
    configured to avoid being blocked.

    many, but many have increased their functionality to be even more collaborative
    and interactive to keep learners engaged and motivated. Moodle 4.0 has made it
    easier for learners to see where they are in a course by making enhancements to
    the Assignment activity, as well as others, to indicate whether an activity has
    been completed, and whether or not the minimum passing score has been achieved.

    material that learners can interact with. This interaction is more engaging, and
    usually more effective, than courses consisting of static material that the learners
    view. While you will probably begin creating your course by adding static material,
    the next step should usually be to ask, "How can I add interactivity to this course?"

    discussion board.There is quite a bit of flexibility: forums can be open, with
    learners having the ability to launch new discussions; they can function for social
    interaction, asking and answering questions; and they can assess the course material.
    | If designed well, a forum can be very engaging. Be sure to ask learners to relate
    to their own experiences, add their opinions, and do research for websites on
    the topic. | Questions need to be developed well to avoid "yes/no" responses or
    ones that say the same thing. Questions need to be changed over time to avoid
    answers being published online. | Collaborative learning, maintaining engagement,
    and assessments. |'

    add and edit web pages, often collaboratively, but wikis can also be individual.Wikis
    can be used in many ways – that is, as knowledge repositories, online creative
    writing journals, and comprehensive manuals for operations, a process, or an industry.
    | Very effective for collaborative activities, particularly those that involve
    areas that have new advancements or innovations. | Can be confused with a glossary
    or a database.Wikis are effective in areas that involve more than just definitions,
    but also questions regarding a process and its implementation. | Collaboration
    to build a knowledge base; can be part of a portfolio. |
