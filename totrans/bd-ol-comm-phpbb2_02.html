The installation process is generally not hard—phpBB has a built-in browser-based installer that makes the job much easier—but there are some pre-requisites and some details you need to be aware of before you begin. There are also some post-installation tasks that you need to perform once phpBB is installed on your system. In this second chapter of the book you will learn:<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/>

Then the section discusses some database-related topics and ends with a checklist you can use to make sure you have everything you need to start the installation process.<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Requirements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec01"/>Requirements</h2></div></div></div><p>phpBB is very flexible in terms of server requirements and you have a lot of options. But let’s concentrate on the configuration that is most widely used, consisting of:<a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Any major operating system</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Apache web server</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">MySQL database system, version 3.22 or higher</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">PHP version 4. PHP3 will also do, but its recommended that you use the latest stable 4.3 version</li></ul></div><p>phpBB was designed with portability in mind, so all of the requirements listed above are very flexible. Let’s look at them in more detail and also see what options do you have.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The operating system</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>OS</strong></span>): phpBB is OS independent. That means it can run on all sorts of operating systems—Windows, Linux, MacOS. You should not have any problem meeting this requirement and can enjoy running your forums in your preferred or most affordable environment.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The web server</strong></span>: phpBB can run on various web servers, including the most popular Apache and Microsofts Internet Information Systems (IIS). If youre using a hosting service, the web server requirement wont be in the way. But if you want to install phpBB on your computer, youll have to take care of this detail. Although describing how to install a web server is not within the scope of this book, youll find some useful information further down.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The database system</strong></span>: Currently supported by phpBB are MySQL 3.22 or higher (including MySQL 4.x), PostgreSQL 7.0.3, MS SQL Server (7 or 2000, directly or via ODBC) and MS Access (2000 or XP) via ODBC. Again, depending if youre installing phpBB locally or on a remote server, youll need to either install a supported database system on your computer or simply ask you service provider what database you have access to.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>PHP</strong></span>: In general, all PHP applications consist of files containing programming instructions that are executed by what is called a PHP interpreter. The PHP interpreter is a piece of software that youll need to have running on the system where you want to install phpBB. If you go with a hosting service, the good news is that PHP is so popular that it would be actually harder to find a host that doesnt support it.<p>PHP 4.x is the most widely used PHP version and also the most widely used for phpBB installations. As already mentioned, PHP 3.x will be sufficient to have your board running, but it’s not recommended. PHP 5 is also not recommended (yet), because phpBB is not thoroughly tested on this platform, due to the fact that phpBB was developed prior to the release of PHP 5.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>phpBB will run on PHP versions 3.x and 4.x, but if you have a choice, you should aim at the latest stable PHP 4.3.x version.</p></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="The Attack Plan"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec02"/>The Attack Plan</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you’re clear on the requirements, let’s explore the options for the system to install phpBB to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>You have an existing web hosting service</strong></span>: In this case all you need to do is contact your hosting provider and ask them if they support PHP and any of the databases listed above, preferably MySQL. If they dont, find out if they can install/enable these for you. If they still cant help you, youll need to pick one of the remaining options.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Youre shopping around for a good hosting provider</strong></span>: The good news is that even the most inexpensive hosting packages often include PHP and MySQL support. There are lots of points to consider when choosing a hosting provider, but at the very least, browse for some independent reviews on the Web. Dont just rush into the cheapest package with huge or even unlimited bandwidth and disk space. Ask your host-to-be a question or two (for example concerning the requirements above) and judge the speed and the quality of their response. Youd want a reliable support when in need.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>You want to install phpBB on your own computer</strong></span>: Sometimes, even if you go with one of the first two options, you might still want to test your board locally. For example, if later on you want to experiment with installing or creating new styles or modifications, it would probably be easier (and definitely safer) to develop and test on your own computer before going live.</li></ul></div><p>If you want to set up the environment on your computer, you have two options: to install all the necessary components one by one, configure them, and make them work together, or to use one of the all-in-one installations (bundles) you can find on the Internet. They usually include one downloadable installer program that takes care of installing and configuring all you need—Apache, PHP, MySQL—and often more. Such all-in-one bundles are XAMPP (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/</a>) and others that are listed at HotScripts, for example (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Software_and_Servers/Installation_Kits/">http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Software_and_Servers/Installation_Kits/</a>).</p><p>If you want to set up your environment yourself and not make use of the bundles available out there, here’s what you need to do.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec01"/></h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec01"/></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Time For Action - Setting Up the Environment on Your Local Computer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl5sec01"/>Time For Action - Setting Up the Environment on Your Local Computer</h5></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Install the Apache web server.<a id="id23" class="indexterm"/><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note34"/>Note</h3><p>Go to<a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi"> http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi</a>.

Welcome to the wonderful world of open-source software!</p><p>Now with a web server running PHP and MySQL (or another database system), let’s take a look at some database preparation work.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Finishing Pre-Install Touch—The Database"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec03"/>Finishing Pre-Install Touch—The Database</h2></div></div></div><p>phpBB will need access to a database, so you’ll have to use an existing database or create a new one. Depending on whether you’ll be installing on your local computer or on a remote server, you’ll have different options for setting up the database required by phpBB; we’ll take a look at those options. If you have a choice, use a new empty database for phpBB; it makes maintenance easier.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec02"/></h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec02"/></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Setting Up the Database for Local Installations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl5sec02"/>Setting Up the Database for Local Installations</h5></div></div></div><p>If you’re installing phpBB on your personal computer, you should have no restrictions creating a new database to use with phpBB. You can do that by using phpMyAdmin or using the console (the command prompt). With phpMyAdmin, creating a new database is really easy; this is one of the first options you’re presented with when you load the application. If you don’t have phpMyAdmin installed, you can use the command prompt to create a new database. Let’s see how to do it both ways. For the purposes the examples in this chapter, let’s say your new database is named "forums".<a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>

Some possible scenarios include:<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Some hosts give you one database only with a predefined name.

Shell access means youll be able to use a command prompt and execute instructions (commands) on the remote server. In this case, find out from your hosting provider how to establish a shell connection to your server. After youre connected, repeat the steps for creating a database using the command prompt as previously described. This time youll be using the database username and password given to you by your host.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In order to establish a shell connection youll need a program, called a<span class="strong"><strong> shell client</strong></span>. A popular choice is the free PuTTY telnet and SSH client (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>).</li></ul></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Security tip</em></span>: If at all possible on your host, create a new MySQL user account, give it only privileges to the new database you’ve just created and use it for the phpBB installation. This may seem a bit too paranoid, but the reason is that usually hosts give you one username and password only and it’s good for everything—FTP, MySQL, control panel, and shell access. So the reason behind creating a new MySQL username/password combo is that if it gets revealed for some reason, the villain who has it can do only limited damage. This password is good for one database only and not FTP, shell, or control panel access.</p><p>When creating this new database user account, it’s a good idea to assign only "select", "insert", "update", and "delete" privileges; the other possible privileges are not needed for the normal functioning of phpBB. The phpBB installation though will also require a "create" privilege and some modification installations might need "alter" or "drop" privileges. So the most security-oriented option would be to assign "select", "insert", "update", "delete", and "create" privileges to the new database user, and once the installation is completed, remove the "create" privilege.</p><p>The actual process of creating the new database user may vary, depending on your hosting provider’s policies. Some might not allow it, some might give you a special interface for it, and some might give you access to phpMyAdmin. Creating a new MySQL user account using phpMyAdmin is pretty straightforward; just click the<span class="strong"><strong> Users</strong></span> link on the phpMyAdmin main page and then fill out the<span class="strong"><strong> Add</strong></span> form.</p><p>If you’re using the command prompt for creating a new user, use the following query:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE
ON forums.*
TO ‘mysecretusername’@’localhost’
IDENTIFIED BY ‘mysecretpassword’;

<span class="strong"><strong>A note about FTP</strong></span>: You’ll need an FTP program, also known as an<span class="emphasis"><em> FTP client</em></span>, in order to transfer files from your computer to a remote server. There are a lot of free/trial FTP programs you can use. Just a simple Google search will yield a lot of results. Generally, using an FTP program is not much different than copying files to different locations on your local computer. The difference is that you need to establish a connection to the remote computer first. In order to do that, you need an FTP hostname, a username and a password, which you probably already have, supplied by your hosting provider.</p></div></div></div>

This step is the time when you need to make an important decision—where on your server you are installing phpBB and how you are naming it.

<span class="strong"><strong>phpbb_</strong></span> is the default value. After the installation, all tables in the database to do with phpBB will have this prefix in their name, such as<span class="strong"><strong> phpbb_users</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> phpbb_posts</strong></span>. It’s not compulsory to use a prefix, but it’s a nice way to tell your phpBB tables from all the rest, in case you have other non-phpBB related tables in the same database. This also allows you, for example, to have two or more distinct phpBB installations that share the same database; you just need to use a different prefix for each installation. Don’t use spaces in this prefix, otherwise the installer will return an error. It’s a good idea to leave the default<span class="strong"><strong> phpbb_</strong></span> value for the prefix, if you don’t have a reason to change it. Most of the phpBB modifications that you may want to install later on will assume this prefix.</p>

What follows is a list of fields of interest:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>General Board Settings</strong></span>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Site name</strong></span>: A friendly name for your site: often, the domain name. It will appear at the top of every page. The default is<code class="literal"> yourdomain.com</code>, and you can see it in action in the previous screenshot.<a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Site description</strong></span>: A brief description of what the site is about, preferably not more than six to seven words. It will appear at the top of every page and is not required. Again, look at the previous screenshot to see the default value<span class="strong"><strong> A _little_ text to describe your forum</strong></span>.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Enable account activation</strong></span>: This refers to the way new users are accepted. There are three options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The users are accepted right away, as soon as they sign up (this is the default option).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They have to confirm their subscription by clicking a link received by e-mail. This way they confirm their wish to become members and also authenticate that they are the owners of the e-mail address supplied during registration. This is probably the most used option.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The members sign-up applications need to be reviewed and approved by an administrator.</li></ul></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>System Timezone</strong></span>: The time zone where your community is mainly located. It’s a default value that every member can overwrite.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Enable GZip Compression</strong></span>: Enabling this option will cause all pages to be compressed when sent from the server and decompressed after they are received by the user’s computer if the user’s browser supports compression. If it doesn’t, the page won’t be compressed by the server. This results in a faster working site and uses less bandwidth, but increases the server load because of the overhead of compressing every page that is served.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cookie settings</strong></span>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cookie name</strong></span>: Normally you don’t change this. You might need to alter this value only if you host more than one forum under the same domain name. If this is the case, you can use a different cookie name for each installation.<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cookie secure</strong></span>: Enable this option if your site runs on Secure Socket Layer (SSL); in other words if your pages are displayed using the secure HTTPS protocol, instead of just HTTP.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Session length [seconds]</strong></span>: Determines how long the user session "lives" before it’s deleted. It’s a security-related setting, which determines how many seconds users can stay inactive (not visiting any board page) before they are logged out by phpBB.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Avatar Settings</strong></span>
</p><p>"Avatar" refers to those little member-specific graphics that appear in the posts below a member’s username. You have three ways to provide this functionality.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Enable gallery avatars</strong></span>: Users can select from a number of predefined graphics that you upload to a specified directory.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Enable remote avatars</strong></span>: Users can put links to graphics that they find on the Internet, stored on other servers.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Enable avatar uploading</strong></span>: Users can upload graphics to your server.</li></ul></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Avatar Storage Path</strong></span>: Where the uploaded avatars are stored; the default is<span class="strong"><strong> images/avatars</strong></span>, which translates to<a class="ulink" href="http://www.yourdomain.com/forum/images/avatars/"> http://www.yourdomain.com/forum/images/avatars/</a>.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Avatar Gallery Path</strong></span>: Where the pre-defined graphics are stored; the default is<span class="strong"><strong> images/avatars/gallery</strong></span>, which translates to<a class="ulink" href="http://www.yourdomain.com"> http://www.yourdomain.com /forum/images/avatars/gallery/</a>.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>COPPA Settings</strong></span>
</p><p>COPPA stands for Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Basically it requires parents’ written consent if their children are to become members of your forums. For more information, see phpBB user guide and<a class="ulink" href="http://www.coppa.org"> http://www.coppa.org</a>.<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>E-mail Settings</strong></span>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Admin Email Address</strong></span>: The e-mail address that you provided during the installation.<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Email Signature</strong></span>: This will be appended to every e-mail phpBB sends on your behalf, such as private message notifications, topic-watch notifications, etc. Use your imagination to come up with friendly message footers to your members.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Use SMTP Server for email</strong></span>: You have the option of using an SMTP server to send mail, instead of the native PHP mail function. Some hosts disable the PHP mail function because of the danger of unethical clients misusing it (to send spam). If this is the case, you need to use an SMTP server to send the mails. Your Internet service provider (ISP, the one you use to connect to the Internet) has most likely given you access to an SMTP server to send e-mails (with Microsoft Outlook, for example). You can use this SMTP server for your bulletin board. You can also use this option if you install phpBB on your own PC and don’t have a mail server set up.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Setting Up the avatars Directory"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl5sec11"/>Setting Up the avatars Directory</h5></div></div></div><p>If you’re allowing members to upload avatars to your server, you have to make the directory that stores them writable.

It’s a very important password, so you wouldn’t want other people to guess it and play around with your board. This is also true for any moderators you decide to assign later on. Remind them to change their passwords to something really hard to guess. For example using the same password as the username is definitely not advisable. Be creative and go with something like<span class="strong"><strong> y0u11n3v3rgue$$</strong></span> (read "you’ll never guess") and<span class="strong"><strong> wh00p3375</strong></span> (read "whoopee 75"). It’s also a good idea to change this password regularly and to use it only for this board (not for other services like Hotmail and the like).</p></div><div class="section" title="Disallow Remote Connections to the Database"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl5sec13"/>Disallow Remote Connections to the Database</h5></div></div></div><p>Remote connections allow you to access your database from a remote location. For instance, from your local machine you can query the database that is running on the remote hosting server. This definitely has benefits—for example for making local backups of the data in the remote database—but it can be a security risk. If the username and password to access the database are somehow revealed, then if the remote connection is enabled, an intruder can access your data from his or her computer. If the remote connection is disabled, the hacker will have to have access to the remote server in order to be able to connect to your database. Additionally with remote connection enabled, the potential hacker can try to guess what your password is by trying different combinations until he or she is connected.</p><p>Some hosting providers let you enable/disable remote connections, while some don’t allow remote connections at all. Check what your situation is and (unless you have a very good reason) make sure the remote connection is disabled.</p></div><div class="section" title="MySQL Account"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl5sec14"/>MySQL Account</h5></div></div></div><p>Use a new MySQL account (or a new account for any other database you might be using for that matter) for the bulletin board. This was described in more detail in the pre-install section of this chapter.</p></div><div class="section" title="config.php"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl5sec15"/>config.php</h5></div></div></div><p>After you change the permissions of the<code class="literal"> config.php</code> file (described in the pre-installation section) so that it’s writable by all, and you install phpBB, it’s time to revert back. Using the exact same methodology as described before, change the permissions to 664.</p><p>Here is a more visual description of the config file after the<code class="literal"> chmod 664 config.php</code> command.

Setting up<code class="literal"> .htaccess</code> protection will result in an additional username/password window that will be displayed when you enter the admin panel. Setting up the protection may not be a trivial task, and there are quite a few tutorials available on the Web that can help you with this.<code class="literal"> .htaccess</code> documentation can be found on the Apache website at<a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/htaccess.html"> http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/htaccess.html</a>.<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>It’s possible that your hosting provider gives you access to an easier interface (a control panel) that can help you setting up the protection.</p><p>So using<code class="literal"> .htaccess</code> directly or through a friendlier interface you can protect the<code class="literal"> admin</code> sub-directory within the root phpBB directory using a username and password different than the "normal" administration password. This way you’re making it harder for potential intruders as they have two different username/password pair to deal with.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Finding Help"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec05"/>Finding Help</h1></div></div></div><p>Remember how we spoke about the huge community of phpBB users? Well, these are the people that can help you out if you have a problem that you cannot figure out. On phpBB.com, there is a support section that contains "static" articles such as the user guide, the knowledge base, and the FAQ, and there’s also the community section (that is not surprisingly powered by phpBB) where phpBB users from around the globe share their experience. The same sort of community of users you can find on phpBBHacks.com.</p><p>When you encounter a problem, don’t panic; you’re not alone, and chances are someone has had and resolved the exact same problem, and this individual is most likely to share the resolution. So it’s very probable that the question you have has already been asked and answered. All you need to do is find it. If you can’t find the resolution you need, post your question on the bulletin board, but make sure you search first.</p><p>Then even though you’ve found your answer, don’t leave right away. You could dawdle for a while and help others with problems that you know how to fix.</p></div>
