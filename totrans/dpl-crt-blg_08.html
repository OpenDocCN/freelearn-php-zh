Your site as it stands at the moment is fully functional and doesn't look awful—it's a bit plain, but it will get the job done! As you will see, however, with a bit of effort creating something entirely new is not out of your reach, and as you might expect, Drupal comes with a host of features to make our lives easier.</p><p>If, like me, you enjoy working on the more creative aspects of a website, then this is really the chapter you have been waiting for. It's time to design, plan, and implement the visual environment in which users will<span class="emphasis"><em> be immersed—if</em></span> you can succeed in creating a pleasing atmosphere in which to interact, then you will certainly have done a lot in terms of ensuring users are happy with your site.</p><p>However, like everything else in this book, we can't simply dive in headlong and learn to swim once we have begun working. There are plenty of interesting things to think about and learn before we begin customizing Drupal's interface.</p><p>You also have the luxury of having a website already set up for you, which frees you to simply make changes here and there to achieve your design goals rather than develop the HTML from scratch. To some extent, this luxury actually restricts you because anything short of a total rewrite of the pages will mean your site retains some of the Drupal<span class="emphasis"><em> flavor</em></span>. But that's not a bad thing at all now, is it?</p><p>To this end, this chapter will discuss the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Planning a web-based interface</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How Drupal's interface works</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">CSS</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Themes</li></ul></div><p>I should warn you that there is quite a lot involved with coming up with an entirely fresh, pleasing, and distinct look for a site. There are lots of fiddly little bits to play around with, so you should be prepared to spend some time on this section because after all, your site's look and feel is really the face you present to your community, and in turn the face of your community to the outside world.</p><p>Another thing to remember is that you should take some time to look at what is already out there. Many issues that you will encounter while designing your site have already been successfully dealt with all over the show, and not only by Drupal users of course. Also, don't be scared to treat your design as an ongoing process—while it is never good to drastically change your site on a weekly basis, regular tweaking or upgrading of your interface can keep it modern and looking shiny new.</p><div class="section" title="Planning a Web-Based Interface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec01"/>Planning a Web-Based Interface</h1></div></div></div><p>The tenet<span class="emphasis"><em> form follows function</em></span> is widely applied in many spheres of human knowledge, ranging from evolution to biokinetics and engineering. It is a well understood concept, which basically says that the way something is built or made must reflect the purpose it was made for. This is an exceptionally sensible thought, and applying it to the design of your site will provide you with a yardstick to measure how well you have designed it. If you, or preferably everyone you ask, can honestly say that your site looks like it is meant to do whatever it is you are doing, then you are doing a good job.</p><p>That's not to say your site should look like every other site that performs the same function. In fact, if anything, you want to make it as distinctive as possible without stepping over the bounds of what you believe your target user will consider<span class="emphasis"><em> good taste</em></span> or<span class="emphasis"><em> common sense</em></span>.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>How do you do that?</em></span> The trick is to relate what you have or do as a website with your specific target audience. If you are providing content that has appeal to both sexes of all ages across all nationalities, races, or religions, then obviously you should go with something that everyone can use. If anything, this might be a slightly flavorless site since you wouldn't want to marginalize any group of users by explicitly making your site friendly to another group. Luckily, though, to some extent your target audience will be slightly easier to define than this, so you can generally make some concessions for a particular type of user.<a class="indexterm" id="id282"/>
</p><p>Bear in mind that while these following sections refer to<span class="emphasis"><em> visual</em></span> or<span class="emphasis"><em> functional</em></span> design, what you are really thinking about is the visual or functional aspect of the<span class="emphasis"><em> interaction</em></span> design, which encompasses all visual and functional design. The interaction design is how you envision your audience using and interacting with your site. This is an important distinction because thinking about everything from the perspective of the user will help to define your choices as you go along.</p><div class="section" title="Visual Design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec01"/>Visual Design</h2></div></div></div><p>There's no beating about the bush on this issue. Make the site appear as visually simple as possible without hiding any critical or useful information. By this, I mean you shouldn't be afraid to leave a fairly large list of items on a page if all the items on that list are useful, and will be (or are) used frequently. Hiding an important thing from users—no matter how easy it appears to be to find it on other pages—will frustrate them, and your popularity might suffer. A consequence of this is that you should not be afraid to have quite long pages that users must scroll down—rather have information available at the bottom of the page than have a complex navigation structure.<a class="indexterm" id="id283"/>
</p><p>How you make your site look can also have a big impact on how users understand the site's working. For example, if you have several different fonts that apply to different links, then it is entirely likely that users will not think of clicking on one type of link or another because of the different font styles. Think about this yourself for a moment! If you were reading a page of text and the links were all given in the same font as the writing, how would you know on which words to click? This can be summed up as:<a class="indexterm" id="id284"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note30"/>Note</h3><p>Make sure your site is visually consistent and that there are no style discrepancies from one page to the next.</p></div></div><p>There are quite a few so-called rules of visual design, which you could apply to your site. These are largely theoretical, and you may or may not wish to read up on these further—might I suggest Google for some good reading matter. Some that might apply to you are: the rule of thirds, which states that things divided up into thirds—either vertically or horizontally—are more visually appealing than other designs; the visual center rule, which states that the visual center of the page (where the eye is most attracted to) is just above and to the right of the actual center of the page.<a class="indexterm" id="id285"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Language"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec02"/>Language</h2></div></div></div><p>Now this is a truly interesting part of your site's design, and the art of writing for the Web is a lot more subtle than just saying what you mean. The reason for this is that you are no longer writing simply for human consumption, but also for consumption by machines. Since machines can only follow a certain number of rules when interpreting a page, the concessions on the language used must be made by the writers (if they want their sites to feature highly on search engines).<a class="indexterm" id="id286"/>
</p><p>Before you worry about making your site's text highly optimized for searching, there are a few more fundamental things that you need to get right. First off, make sure your language is clear and concise! This is the most important; rather sacrifice racy, stylized copy for more mundane text if the mundane text is going to elucidate your important points better.</p><p>Apart from the actual content of your language, the visual and structural appearance of the copy is also important. Use bold or larger fonts to emphasize headings or important points, and ensure that you space your text out nicely to make the page easier on the eye and therefore easier to read and understand—we saw an example of this in the previous chapter when we posted a well formatted and laid out "about us" page.</p></div><div class="section" title="Images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec03"/>Images</h2></div></div></div><p>Working with images for the Web is very much an art! I don't mean this in the sense that generally you should be quite artistic in order to make nice pictures. I mean that actually managing and dealing with image files is itself an art. There is a lot of work to be done for the aspiring website owner with respect to attaining a pleasing and meaningful visual environment. This is because the Web is the one environment that is most reliant on visual images to have an effect on users because sight and sound are the only two senses that are targeted by the Internet, for now.<a class="indexterm" id="id287"/>
</p><p>In order to have the freedom to manipulate images as required by your site, you really need to use a reasonably powerful image editor. Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro are examples of good image-editing environments, but anything that allows you to save files in a variety of different formats and provides resizing capabilities should be sufficient. Of course, if you have to take digital photographs yourself, then you will need to ensure you make the photos as uniform as possible, with a background that doesn't distract from the object in question—editing the images to remove the background altogether is probably best.<a class="indexterm" id="id288"/>
</p><p>There are several areas of concern when working with images, all of which need to be closely scrutinized if you hope to produce an integrated and pleasing visual environment (not all of these relate to what your customers actually see, funnily enough):<a class="indexterm" id="id289"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">One of the biggest problems with images is that they take up a lot more memory than text or code. For this reason you need to have an effective method for dealing with large images that will be required for your site—simply squashing large images into thumbnails will slow everything down because the server still has to upload the entire large file to the user's machine.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">One common mistake people make when dealing with images is not working on them early on in the process to make them as uniform in size and type as possible. If all your images are of one size and of the same dimension, then you are going to have things a lot easier than most. In fact, this should really be your aim before you do anything involving the site—make<span class="emphasis"><em> sure your images are all uniform</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Deciding what type of image you actually want to use from the multitude available can also be a bit of an issue because some image types take up more space than others, and some may not even be rendered properly in a browser. By and large there are really only three image types that are most commonly used—GIF, PNG, and JPG.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The intended use of an image can also be a big factor when deciding how to create, size, and format the file. For example, icons and logos should really be saved as PNG or GIF files whereas photos and large or complex images should be saved in the JPG format.<a class="indexterm" id="id290"/></li></ul></div><p>Three types of image files were mentioned in the bulleted list. Let's take a quick look at those here.<a class="indexterm" id="id291"/>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>GIF</strong></span>, or Graphics Interchange Format, is known for its compression and the fact that it can store and display multiple images. The major drawback to GIF is that images can only display up to 256 distinct colors. For photographic-quality images, this is a significant obstacle. However, you should use GIFs for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Images with a transparent background</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Animated graphics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Smaller, less complex images requiring no more than 256 colors</li></ul></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>PNG</strong></span>, or Portable Network Graphics, is actually designed as a replacement for GIF files. In general it can achieve greater file compression, give a wider range of color depth, and quite a bit more. PNG, unlike GIF files, does not support animations. You can use PNG files for anything that you would otherwise use GIFs for, with the exception of animations.</p><p>Incidentally, there is also an MNG format, which allows for animations—you might want to check that out as an alternative to animated GIFs.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>JPG</strong></span>, or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), should be used when presenting photo‑realistic images. JPG can compress large images while retaining the overall photographic quality. JPG files can use any number of colors, and so it's a very convenient format for images that require a lot of colors. JPG should be used for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Photographs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Larger, complex images requiring more than 256 to display properly<a class="indexterm" id="id292"/></li></ul></div><p>That about covers it for the planning phase of your site's interface development. Before we begin an in-depth look at themes, which are responsible for just about everything when it comes to your site's look and feel, we will need to take a look at how the various web technologies are combined in Drupal to provide your site with its interface.<a class="indexterm" id="id293"/>
</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="How Drupal's Interface Works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec02"/>How Drupal's Interface Works</h1></div></div></div><p>Knowing a bit about the theory behind creating an appealing site is one thing; applying this knowledge within the context of a Drupal site is another thing entirely. Because of this it is important that we take some time to understand exactly how everything is tied together. You have already seen that HTML and PHP can and do form part of a site's interface, but many of you will have noticed the<span class="strong"><strong> themes</strong></span> link under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu item and wondered what all that is about.<a class="indexterm" id="id294"/>
</p><p>Further, some of you might have also been wondering what on earth a theme engine is, and how both themes and theme engines relate to your Drupal site. The following two definitions should clear up a few things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Theme:</strong></span> A file, or set of PHP files, that defines and controls the layout of Drupal's web pages. The look and feel of these pages is in turn controlled by<span class="strong"><strong> CSS</strong></span> (Cascading Style Sheet) files, also provided by the theme. Various standard images might also be held within the theme for use by the site.<a class="indexterm" id="id295"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Theme engine:</strong></span> Provides functionality to create your own unique theme, which in turn gives excellent control over the all aspects of a Drupal site, ranging from what functionality to include within a page, to how individual page elements will be presented.<a class="indexterm" id="id296"/></li></ul></div><p>Making use of a theme engine requires some programming know-how, as themes are built using code. Modifying themes, on the other hand, is fairly easy, and once a suitable base theme has been found, creating your own unique site is a matter of modifying the theme accordingly. The following diagram should help you picture how everything works together, and will place the subject matter of this chapter into context:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How Drupal's Interface Works" src="graphics/1800_08_01.jpg"/></div><p>This diagram shows a kind of upside-down waterfall in that the arrows between each level of the diagram represent a contribution of something to the level above. In other words, we can regard PHP, HTML, and CSS as being fundamental technologies that provide the base from which theme engines and themes provide HTML to browsers. Once a theme has provided the HTML to the browser, the browser renders this to the screen for the user to view.</p><p>There are several things to make a note of here. Firstly, not all theme engines are pure PHP based. For example, there is a Smarty theme engine available in Drupal for use by people who are familiar with Smarty templates. Second, there are many types of browser out there, and not all of them are created equal. What this means is that a page that is rendered nicely on one browser might look bad, or worse, not even function properly on another. For this reason you should<span class="emphasis"><em> test your site using several different browsers!</em></span>
<a class="indexterm" id="id297"/>
</p><p>The Drupal help site has this to say about browsers:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It is recommended you use the Firefox browser with developer toolbar and the view formatted source extensions.</p></blockquote></div><p>You can obtain a copy of the Firefox browser at<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/"> http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/</a> if you wish to use something other than Internet Explorer.<a class="indexterm" id="id298"/>
</p><p>Now, in terms of how this relates to our situation, we are going to limit ourselves to the selection of a base theme, which we will modify to provide us with the site's interface. This means that for now, you don't have to concern yourself with the intricacies of theme engines.<span class="emphasis"><em> Can we now move on and look at themes directly?</em></span> Not yet; notice that in the previous diagram there is a box containing the term CSS. This is very important in terms of developing our interface, and since we have already seen HTML and PHP in action, let's learn a bit about CSS before continuing.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="CSS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec03"/>CSS</h1></div></div></div><p>The pages in a Drupal site obtain their style-related information from associated style sheets, which are held in the site's theme. Using style sheets gives designers excellent, fine-grained control over the appearance of web pages, and even allows you to produce some great effects. The appearance of pretty much every aspect of the site can be controlled from within a theme, and all that is needed is a little knowledge of fonts, colors, and style sheet syntax.<a class="indexterm" id="id299"/>
</p><p>Before we go any further, it will make life easier if you have a readymade list of the type of things you should look at setting using the style sheet. The following is a list of the most common areas (defined by HTML elements) where style sheets can be used to determine the look and feel of a site's:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Background</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Text</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Font</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Color</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Images</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Border</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Margin</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Padding</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">List</li></ul></div><p>As well as being able to change all these aspects of HTML, you can also apply different effects depending on whether certain conditions, like a mouse hovering over the specified area, are met—this will be demonstrated a little later on. You can also specify attributes for certain HTML tags, which can then be used to apply style-sheet styles to those specific tags instead of creating application-wide changes. For example, if you had one paragraph style with a<code class="literal"> class</code> attribute set, like this:<a class="indexterm" id="id300"/>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></div><p>you could specify this type of paragraph in your style sheet explicitly by saying something like:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">p.center { color: green; }
</pre></div><p>Analyzing this line highlights the structure of the standard style-sheet code block, which appears in the form:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Selector:</strong></span> in this case<code class="literal"> p.center</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Property:</strong></span> in this case<code class="literal"> color</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Delimiter:</strong></span> always<code class="literal"> :</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Value:</strong></span> in this case<code class="literal"> green</code></li></ul></div><p>Note that all the property/value pairs are contained within curly braces, and each is ended with a semi-colon. This introduction to CSS has been very brief, and there are plenty of excellent resources available. If you would like to learn more about this (and it is highly recommended), then visit:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>CSS Discuss:</strong></span><a class="ulink" href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/">http://css-discuss.incutio.com/   </a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>HTML Dog:</strong></span><a class="ulink" href="http://www.htmldog.com/">  http://www.htmldog.com/ </a></li></ul></div><p>Now that you have an understanding of how Drupal's interface is created through the use of HTML, PHP, CSS, and themes, along with the knowledge of how stylesheets work, we are ready to begin looking at…</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Themes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec04"/>Themes</h1></div></div></div><p>The use of themes makes Drupal exceptionally flexible when it comes to working with the site's interface. Because the functionality of the site is by and large decoupled from the presentation of the site, it is quite easy to chop and change the look, without having to worry about affecting the functionality at all. This is obviously a very useful aspect because it frees you up to experiment however you please knowing that, if worst comes to worst, you can reset the default settings and start from scratch.<a class="indexterm" id="id301"/>
</p><p>You can think of a theme as a<span class="emphasis"><em> template for your site</em></span>, which you can modify in order to achieve the look and feel you want. Of course, different themes have wildly varying attributes; so it is important to find the theme that most closely resembles what you are looking for in order to reduce the amount of work you need to do.</p><p>Accordingly, the first task we need to complete is…</p><div class="section" title="Choosing a Base Theme"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec04"/>Choosing a Base Theme</h2></div></div></div><p>By default, Drupal ships with a few default themes and there are quite a few more available in the<span class="strong"><strong> Downloads</strong></span> section of the Drupal site.<a class="indexterm" id="id302"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note31"/>Note</h3><p>Some themes require the use of a theme engine, in which case, you will need to also download and install the appropriate engine before attempting to use that theme.</p></div></div><p>Looking at what's already present on the<span class="strong"><strong> themes</strong></span> page in Drupal, we can see the following:<a class="indexterm" id="id303"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Choosing a Base Theme" src="graphics/1800_08_02.jpg"/></div><p>You might be wondering why it is possible to enable as many themes as you like, yet select only one as the default. The reason for this is that if you enable more than one option, then these options are available for users (assuming they have sufficient permissions) to select by editing their<span class="strong"><strong> Theme configuration</strong></span> preferences on the<span class="strong"><strong> edit</strong></span> tab of the<span class="strong"><strong> my account</strong></span> page as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id304"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Choosing a Base Theme" src="graphics/1800_08_03.jpg"/></div><p>In this case,<span class="strong"><strong> bluemarine, chameleon</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> marvin</strong></span> have all been enabled, with<span class="strong"><strong> bluemarine</strong></span> selected as the default. Users can then themselves select their preference for how they wish to view the site.<a class="indexterm" id="id305"/>
</p><p>Back to the list of available themes! Enabling the<span class="strong"><strong> pushbutton</strong></span> theme, and setting it as the default, causes the site, which has been presented in the standard bluemarine theme up until now, to look something like this:<a class="indexterm" id="id306"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Choosing a Base Theme" src="graphics/foo.jpg"/></div><p>This is a fairly vast change from the previous look provided by the bluemarine theme; however, you should be able to spot the fact that the generic layout hasn't changed much—there are still three columns, there is a heading section containing the site name and logo, there is a navigation section and various boxes, and so forth. What<span class="emphasis"><em> have</em></span> changed are the fonts, colors, and a few images—notice in particular that there is now a background image in the heading section of this theme.</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note32"/>Note</h3><p>You should take the time to view each and every theme that is available by default in order to get a feel for what is on offer.</p></div></div><p>That is not the end of the story, because the Drupal site also has a whole bunch of themes for us to explore, so let's head on over to the themes page at<a class="ulink" href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">  http://drupal.org/project/Themes </a>  and select the relevant version tab to bring up the themes that are available for your installation of Drupal. Please make note that some of these themes require you to download a theme engine—the<span class="strong"><strong> Box_grey_smarty</strong></span> contribution is an example of a theme that requires the Smarty theme engine in order to function.<a class="indexterm" id="id307"/>
</p><p>You have already seen how to download and install other modules, and the process for installing themes is no different—simply download and extract the contents of the desired theme to your<code class="literal"> themes</code> folder. For example, the<span class="strong"><strong> box_grey</strong></span> theme was downloaded, and provides us with two new options in our list of themes, as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id308"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Choosing a Base Theme" src="graphics/1800_08_04.jpg"/></div><p>Enabling the<span class="strong"><strong> box_grey</strong></span> option and setting it as the default causes the site to look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Choosing a Base Theme" src="graphics/1800_08_05.jpg"/></div><p>You now have a bunch of default themes to choose from as well as a couple of contributed ones to look over. Once you have decided on one you like, there are a few things to contend with before moving to the next phase. As you might have expected, we can configure the theme by simply clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> link on the<span class="strong"><strong> themes</strong></span> page, so let's take a look at that here.</p></div><div class="section" title="Configuring Your Themes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec05"/>Configuring Your Themes</h2></div></div></div><p>Clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> tab at the top of the themes page brings up the global theme options, which will influence each theme regardless of which one is being used—useful if you know that you always want certain features enabled (it's also easy enough to navigate between global and theme-specific settings using the links given at the top of the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> page).<a class="indexterm" id="id309"/>
</p><p>We will concentrate on the<span class="strong"><strong> global settings</strong></span> page here as this is representative of all the theme configuration pages, so you won't have any problems working on each one individually. Remember that you can override these settings by working on the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> page of a specific theme.</p><p>The first section allows you to either use the default logo supplied with the theme, or alternatively, specify a path to your own logo or upload a new logo to the site:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Your Themes" src="graphics/1800_08_06.jpg"/></div><p>In the case of the demo site, we will be making use of a background image to display the logo and name; so this can be unchecked. If you have a site logo, or plan to have one, then simply upload it here.</p><p>Drupal also provides us with the ability to specify which content types require post information to be displayed. Now, we have already seen that there are certain types of pages for which we don't need to display this type of information—for example, the<span class="emphasis"><em> about us</em></span> page should be presented as is without informing users precisely who created it.<a class="indexterm" id="id310"/>
</p><p>The reason for the settings as shown in the last screenshot is that it is important to identify a blog posting with the person who posted it, and likewise for forum topics. However, when it comes to things like polls, pages, book pages, or stories, it is less important to do so—often because these sorts of things will be handled by site administrators anyway. For the moment, I have left the<span class="strong"><strong> page</strong></span> type as the only type to forgo post information.</p><p>Please bear in mind that you need to think about what makes sense for your site and apply the settings that reflect<span class="emphasis"><em> your specific needs</em></span>. For example, it may well be important to identify who has contributed certain book pages so that the authors can be contacted in case there is a need to query or modify content on the book page (especially since books are generally collaborative efforts).</p><p>The following section allows you to specify<span class="strong"><strong> Logo image settings</strong></span> and an icon that will be displayed in the site's address bar and in any bookmarks. Once again, what you use here is really up to you. For the purposes of our site, we need not create a specific icon, and we don't yet have a logo to upload; so we can leave things blank for the moment.<a class="indexterm" id="id311"/>
</p><p>The rest of the<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> page looks like this as a result:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Your Themes" src="graphics/1800_08_07.jpg"/></div><p>As you might have guessed, everything has been left blank because we are not specifying anything new and we don't want the default logo or icon to display.</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note33"/>Note</h3><p>You will need to ensure that whatever you set here is not unintentionally overridden in the individual theme's<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> page.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Customizing Your Theme"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec06"/>Customizing Your Theme</h2></div></div></div><p>Up until now, any settings or changes you have made have been fairly generic. Things are about to change as we begin to implement some more radical modifications that will require amendments to the style sheet in order to get things just right. In the case of the demo site, I have chosen to work with the<span class="strong"><strong> box_grey</strong></span> theme as this most closely resembles the look that is envisaged and has features that are suitable for learning purposes.<a class="indexterm" id="id312"/>

This allows us to work on a development version of the theme without putting the original files at risk. Go back to<span class="strong"><strong> themes</strong></span> in your Drupal<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> section and enable the new<span class="strong"><strong> box_grey_dev</strong></span> theme, setting it as the default. It is important you do this so that you know that you are viewing the correct theme when you check to see what effect any changes you make have on the look of the site.</p><p>Now, opening up the<code class="literal"> box_grey_dev</code> folder, you will notice that there are a few<code class="literal"> .tpl.php</code> files, namely:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">node.tpl.php</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">page.tpl.php</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">image_gallery.tpl.php</code></li></ul></div><p>which are responsible for the layout of their namesakes. For example, a snippet of the code in<code class="literal"> page.tpl.php</code> looks like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;table id="content"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;?php if ($sidebar_left != ""): ?&gt;

&lt;td class="sidebar" id="sidebar-right"&gt;

&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre></div><p>As you can see, this uses HTML to create a table that defines the content of each page. It uses a bunch of PHP<code class="literal"> if</code> statements to check whether or not, for example, to display things like the left‑hand sidebar or even the mission statement. The PHP code is embedded within HTML tags, which have certain attributes associated with them—like<code class="literal"> id="mission"</code> or<code class="literal"> id="message"</code>. Don't worry about how these PHP variables are populated; we don't want to alter the way in which the site functions, we are simply looking at how it is laid out.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>But why have they bothered to set the class and id attributes for different sections of the HTML page?</em></span> This is where the power of CSS comes into play. We already know that we want to create a consistent look for our site. What this means is that every type of related content should have the same look and feel—in other words, the content of each page should be presented in a similar manner. This being the case, we can classify a<code class="literal"> class</code> or<code class="literal"> id</code> of content to be of a certain type, and then, using that attribute tag, specify how it should be laid out within the style sheet.<a class="indexterm" id="id314"/>
</p><p>You should be asking for proof, and here it is…</p><p>Open up the<code class="literal"> style.css</code> file in the<code class="literal"> box_grey_dev</code> theme and search for the snippet of code that reads:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">body {
color: #000;
background: #fff;
font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif;
font-size: 84%;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
}
</pre></div><p>Change this to:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">body {
color: #000;
background: <span class="strong"><strong>#8E6C63;</strong></span>
font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif;
font-size: 84%;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
}
</pre></div><p>Save these changes, and refresh the view of your Drupal site in your browser. You should now find that the content on your page has changed so that your pages look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Customizing Your Theme" src="graphics/1800_08_08.jpg"/></div><p>A single change to the<code class="literal"> body</code> tag in the style sheet has changed the background color throughout each and every page of the whole site. This is quite a powerful and useful property of style sheets, and is precisely why everyone uses them so much nowadays. You can change this back to your original setting or leave it as is—it makes no difference at the moment since it will no doubt change once you have decided on a color scheme for your site.</p><p>Now that you know how to implement a change and view the effects of this change on your site, you are ready to continue with modifying the style sheet to reflect how you want the site to look. In the sections that follow, we will discuss several different types of modifications, without grinding through each and every one—and there are a lot of different properties associated with web pages, believe me! Once you have the hang of making changes in one area, it is easy to apply that knowledge somewhere else, so you should find the coverage here sufficient to get you up and running with confidence.<a class="indexterm" id="id315"/>
</p><p>One of the first tasks required for the demo site is to create and upload an image that will serve as the logo and title in the header section of the site.</p></div><div class="section" title="Images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec01"/>Images</h2></div></div></div><p>Images and background images can be tricky to work with because they are generally a fixed width in length, unlike web pages, which can be resized. It can look quite awful if an image stops short of the page size or is in the wrong place, and so we need to work out how to make our images blend into the site so that viewers working on different screens don't end up seeing un-neat images.<a class="indexterm" id="id316"/>
</p><p>In the case of the demo site, I wanted a rough and fairly evocative scene in nature, and what better to use than a sunset shown through African bush (notice that the site's name/logo is actually part of this image, which is why we have done away with the standard site name and logo):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Images" src="graphics/1800_08_09.jpg"/></div><p>In order to present this on the site, however, we need to do a bit of work with the style sheet. Also, we want this to be presented right up against the top left-hand corner of the page so this will effectively be our site's logo image. Adding this as the site's logo is a simple matter of uploading it in the theme's<span class="strong"><strong> configure</strong></span> page as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Images" src="graphics/1800_08_10.jpg"/></div><p>and ensuring that the<span class="strong"><strong> Logo</strong></span> option is enabled for this particular theme. Since you have access to the file system, you could also copy the image directly to the<code class="literal"> files</code> folder and then reference it from the<span class="strong"><strong> Path to custom logo</strong></span> text box directly above the<span class="strong"><strong> Upload logo image</strong></span> box:<a class="indexterm" id="id317"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Images" src="graphics/1800_08_11.jpg"/></div><p>You could also simply save the new logo image over the old original one, and it will display as normal too.</p><p>If you find that you are having problems with viewing this image, then it is most likely that your<span class="strong"><strong> File system settings</strong></span> in the<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span> section of the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> menu are at fault. Check them to ensure that you are saving files to the correct places and that you are then attempting to access them from the correct place.</p><p>With that done, we can now take a look at the site to see the effect this has had:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Images" src="graphics/1800_08_12.jpg"/></div><p>Oh dear! This doesn't look very good at the moment, because if you look carefully, the new image is offset to the right (as well as downwards, even though this may not be so noticeable in the screenshot). In order to rectify this we will need to take a look at the cause of the offset. To do this, we need to find out which code is responsible for displaying this area of the page.</p><p>Looking near the top of the<code class="literal"> page.tpl.php</code> file we see the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div id="header"&gt;
&lt;?php if ($search_box): ?&gt;
&lt;form action="&lt;?php print $search_url ?&gt;" method="post"&gt;
&lt;div id="search"&gt;
&lt;input class="form-text" type="text" size="15" value="" name="edit[keys]" /&gt;&lt;input class="form-submit" type="submit" value="&lt;?php print $search_button_text ?&gt;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
  <span class="strong"><strong>                        
&lt;?php if ($logo) : ?&gt;
&lt;a href="&lt;?php print url() ?&gt;" title="Index Page"&gt;&lt;img src="&lt;?php print($logo) ?&gt;" alt="Logo" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
  </strong></span>                        
</pre></div><p>The highlighted code at the bottom of this snippet is responsible for displaying the site's logo (depending on<code class="literal"> $logo)</code>. As you can see this section uses<code class="literal"> header</code> as the<code class="literal"> id</code> attribute for the<code class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, so we should be able to find out what's going on by looking this up in the style sheet. Sure enough, we find the following two header-related tags, which affect our image's position:<a class="indexterm" id="id318"/>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#header {
position: relative;
padding: 1em 0 0 0;
margin: 0;
}
#header img {
margin: 0 0.75em 0 1em;
float: left;
}
</pre></div><p>Both of these can be modified to remove the padding and margin that cause the unwanted offset, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#header {
position: relative;
padding: 0 0 0 0;
margin: 0;
}
#header img {
margin: 0 0.75em 0 0;
float: left;
}
</pre></div><p>With these changes saved, you will find that the image is displayed in the desired position. Obviously, you could add padding or change the margins associated with the image as you please.</p><p>It is important to realize at this point that changes like this might not be limited only to the area you intend. It may so happen that making a change meant to correct one area actually harms another area—in this case, the loss of padding might have caused images in other areas of the heading, if we were using any, to look bad.<span class="emphasis"><em> How can this problem be resolved?</em></span> You already know that we can add certain attributes to certain tags on a page. To solve this problem, you would add your own custom tag to the area to be altered, and reference it from the style sheet, giving it the properties you require.</p><p>Of course, you might want to add a background image to your site too. If you do intend to use background images, make sure that they don't affect the usability of the site. Don't distract or hinder the user in any way from viewing the content. If you are sure that your background image won't be detrimental in any way, then the use of the<code class="literal"> background</code> property is the way forward.<a class="indexterm" id="id319"/>
</p><p>For example, I modified the<code class="literal"> body</code> block in the style sheet as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">body {
color: #000;
font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif;
font-size: 84%;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
<span class="strong"><strong>background: url(http://localhost/drupal/files/block_background.png) no-repeat top;</strong></span>
}
</pre></div><p>From this you can see that the<code class="literal"> background</code> attribute can actually do far more than specify the color to be used—we are not even specifying a background color at the moment because we will deal with colors shortly. In this case, it also sets an address where the background image is to be found. It forces the browser not to repeat the image (we don't want a busy pattern of repeated images in the background cluttering up the site), and finally tells the browser to render the image at the top of the body area. Assuming you have in fact created an image that you want to use (in this case the image is entitled<code class="literal"> block_background.png)</code> and have ensured that it is small, you would end up with something like this:<a class="indexterm" id="id320"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Images" src="graphics/1800_08_13.jpg"/></div><p>As you can hopefully tell, this background image is fairly unobtrusive and doesn't make it particularly difficult to read any of the content, although, quite clearly, it not the same color as the background yet. Of course, you aren't limited to adding background images to the body of the site—you can add them in other places too. Just check which HTML tags support the<code class="literal"> background</code> or<code class="literal"> background-image</code> options first.</p><p>Before we move on to look at colors, it is important to realize that there is an unfortunate problem with the way things have been done here. Can you spot it? Think about will happen when these changes are deployed to your live site.<span class="emphasis"><em> What is the URL of that domain going to be?</em></span> It is certain that it will not be<code class="literal"> http://localhost/drupal</code>; so when the time comes for your style sheet to go off in search of your background image by looking for<code class="literal"> http://localhost/drupal/files/ block_background.png</code>, it is going to fail.<a class="indexterm" id="id321"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Consider adding all theme-related images to the actual<code class="literal"> theme</code> folder and not simply uploading them to the standard<code class="literal"> files</code> folder.</p></div></div><p>Let's try this out by creating an<code class="literal"> images</code> folder under<code class="literal"> box_grey_dev</code>. Insert your background image into this folder and then change the absolute URL<code class="literal"> http://localhost/drupal/files/block_background.png</code> to the relative URL<code class="literal"> images/block_background.png</code> and confirm that you get the expected result.<a class="indexterm" id="id322"/>
</p><p>Now, when the time comes to deploy your site, you won't have the problem of losing images, because the relative URL paths are conserved—it is the absolute paths that change.</p></div><div class="section" title="Colors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec02"/>Colors</h2></div></div></div><p>With the new images in place, you might have noticed that neither fits well with the rest of the site because it is currently white by default. In order to rectify this, we are going to change the background color of the site's<code class="literal"> body</code> tag to the following color:<a class="indexterm" id="id323"/>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">body {
color: #000;
background: <span class="strong"><strong>#BEBEBE</strong></span> url(images/block_background.png) no-repeat top;
font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif;
font-size: 84%;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
}
</pre></div><p>The site now looks a little better with that modification. The background image integrates seamlessly and the header image now fades into the correct color so that there is a natural transition between the image and the rest of the page as users expand the width of their browsers.</p><p>With the change in background color, however, a host of changes need to be made to other colors, especially the colors used for hyperlinks. Of course, it's not even necessary to change the background color! I could have always blended the header image with the default color, or made the background of the background image transparent, but let's continue on with some more changes to get an idea of what can be done.</p><p>Now, there can be as many or as few changes as you like to your site's colors. You have already seen that changing the color of an attribute such as<code class="literal"> background</code> or<code class="literal"> color</code> is simply a matter of inserting the new color code into the correct place; now we will make a list of the more interesting changes as follows.<a class="indexterm" id="id324"/>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Hyperlinks:</em></span>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">a, a:link { color: <span class="strong"><strong>#3A3730;</strong></span> }
a:visited { color: <span class="strong"><strong>#111111;</strong></span> }
a:hover, a:focus { color: <span class="strong"><strong>#888888; </strong></span>}
a:active { color: <span class="strong"><strong>#444444;</strong></span> }
.sidebar .block a:hover { color: <span class="strong"><strong>#444444;</strong></span> }
#primary a:hover { color: <span class="strong"><strong>#777;     </strong></span>}
</pre></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Sidebars:</em></span>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">.sidebar .block {
background: <span class="strong"><strong>#E5E5E5;</strong></span>
border: solid 1px #999;
margin: 0 5px 5px 5px;
padding: 0 5px 5px 5px;
}
</pre></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Input:</em></span>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">input, textarea {
background: <span class="strong"><strong>#E5E5E5;</strong></span>
color: inherit;
border: 1px solid #777;
}
</pre></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Footer:</em></span>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#footer {
color: #666;
background: <span class="strong"><strong>#E5E5E5;</strong></span>
border-top: solid 1px #777;
padding: 1em 1em 1em 1em;
font-size: 0.9em;
text-align: center;
}
</pre></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Primary:</em></span>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#primary {
font-size: 1.2em;
border-top: solid 1px #999;

                            <span class="strong"><strong>border: solid 1px #999;
background: #E5E5E5;</strong></span>    
                                
}
</pre></div><p>Once all the color changes have been made, a standard page might look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Colors" src="graphics/1800_08_14.jpg"/></div><p>The site as it now stands is easy to use, and hopefully you will agree that the color co-ordination is at least easy on the eye. Remember when making your own adjustments that there are plenty of color-related settings in the style sheet, so you really need to go through your site with a fine-tooth comb to ensure that there are no nasty surprises when links disappear because they are very similar in color to the background and so on.<a class="indexterm" id="id325"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Page Modifications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec03"/>Page Modifications</h2></div></div></div><p>It's entirely possible that the actual layout of the page is not to your liking. In this case, there are two options open to you when it comes to effecting change. The style sheet can be used for limited numbers of change. For example, if you found that the sidebars were too narrow for the site, they can be broadened (or narrowed if required) to a fixed width in pixels, by altering the following block:<a class="indexterm" id="id326"/>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">td.sidebar {
vertical-align: top;
padding: 0;
    <span class="strong"><strong>width: 200px;</strong></span>                            

}
</pre></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>But what if you needed some more drastic alterations to the site?</em></span> Let's say, for example, that you wanted to add an extra column to each page in order to insert some advertising in the hope that you could generate some revenue from the site. In order to do this we need to look at the<code class="literal"> page.tpl.php</code> file, since this is where the layout of each page is controlled. Depending on how adventurous you are, you could add some conditional PHP code in order to display the column with its advertising only at specific times. For our purposes, it is enough to simply add the new column.</p><p>Incidentally, the advertising we will use for the demonstration comes directly from the Amazon associates site, and if you are interested in using this type of advertising, make sure you check out the various Amazon-related contributions on the Drupal site. For the moment, the important bit is seeing how to add the column—you can take a look at the contributions or Amazon associates at your leisure.</p><p>Let's say we want the column to appear on the far right-hand side of the page, after the right sidebar, so that it doesn't really impinge on the use of the site in any appreciable way. If this is the case, we need to find the spot in the code where the right sidebar is added, and add the new column in there. Look for this snippet of code in the<code class="literal"> page.tpl.php</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;td class="sidebar" id="sidebar-right"&gt;
&lt;?php print $sidebar_right ?&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</pre></div><p>As you can tell, this is responsible for adding a table cell that contains the right sidebar. Simply adding another cell after this should do the trick, so let's go ahead and try that. Make the following changes to the file:<a class="indexterm" id="id327"/>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?php if ($sidebar_right != ""): ?&gt;
&lt;td class="sidebar" id="sidebar-right"&gt;
&lt;?php print $sidebar_right ?&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
   <span class="strong"><strong>&lt;td valign="top" width="120"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=**************&amp;o=1&amp; p=11&amp;l=ez&amp;f=ifr&amp;f=ifr" width="120" height="600" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="0" style="border:none;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;</strong></span>                             
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre></div><p>There are several important points to note here. Firstly, the new cell, enclosed by<code class="literal">&lt;td&gt;</code> tags, was placed after the PHP<code class="literal"> if</code> statement because we don't want it subjected to the same conditions as the right sidebar (it should simply display on every single page).</p><p>Secondly, as well as content being vertically aligned at the top of the cell, the width of the cell is given as 120 pixels because we know from the Amazon code that the width of the advertisement is always 120 pixels (this is because we have selected the ad to be of a specific dimension). Finally, the advertisement code that has been added is provided by Amazon, and if you wish to obtain ads like this, then at some stage you will need to register with Amazon to obtain your ID (blanked out in the previous code with<code class="literal"> *</code> symbols).<a class="indexterm" id="id328"/>
</p><p>Taking a look at the site now shows that the advertisement is displayed as expected:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Page Modifications" src="graphics/1800_08_15.jpg"/></div><p>Of course, there are plenty of different things you may want to achieve on your pages, so spending some time playing around with the code will help you out later on when you need to make more serious changes to the site. You might even want to add banner ads in the header section. Recall that we cheated slightly by turning the site's logo space into the whole header. Doing this means that there is still space allocated for other things within the header (even though this is not visible) and as an exercise you might want to see if you can make use of this space.</p><p>This reminds me to reiterate…<a class="indexterm" id="id329"/>
</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note35"/>Note</h3><p>It is extremely important that you test out whatever changes you make to your site on more than one browser!</p></div></div><p>Testing your layout goes deeper than simply checking if everything is in the correct place. It is important that you ensure CSS and HTML is valid and correct, and resources to achieve this are available automatically in<code class="literal"> box_grey</code>. Simply scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Page Modifications" src="graphics/1800_08_16.jpg"/></div><p>Once your site is up and running on the Internet at a public domain, clicking on these links will help you ensure that your layout code is valid. If any problems are reported, then it is up to you to ensure that your site complies as closely as possible. Unfortunately, if you try this from your development machine you will more than likely receive an error message because these services will only work on public domains.<a class="indexterm" id="id330"/>

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec05"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>From learning about what considerations must be taken into account when planning your website's look and feel, to making changes to the code, this chapter has given you a firm grounding in the fundamentals of working with Drupal interfaces.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of customizing a site's look is understanding how Drupal is set up in order to leverage the power of themes. As we saw, themes provide a kind of template from which you can work to create your own unique site. This saves us a lot of time and effort because we no longer need to work from scratch. We also briefly touched on the possibility of generating themes from theme engines and hopefully you will feel confident enough to begin looking at this in more detail once you gain more experience.</p><p>With respect to building your site's interface, experience is very important. There are three main technologies that you need to spend some time working with: HTML, CSS, and PHP. In this chapter we looked at CSS in some detail before setting about modifying the style sheet supplied with our chosen base theme. Whatever theme you choose as your site's base, the tasks you face will be similar in nature to the ones discussed in this chapter and hopefully you will find that CSS is a most powerful and useful weapon in your armory.</p><p>The knowledge gained from working with images and HTML, as well as the application of the design considerations discussed will help not only with your Drupal site, but with any other web‑based application that you end up working with. Gaining an appreciation for the various different types of design, as well as having to work with images and code, will allow you to create more ambitious graphical user interfaces in the future.</p></div></body></html>
