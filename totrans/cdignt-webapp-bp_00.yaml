- en: This book comprises eight projects. These projects are deliberately made with
    extension and modification in mind, that is, as much as possible, I've tried to
    build each project in such a way that you can apply your own requirements easily
    and you don't have to study the code for weeks on end to work out how it functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following each chapter as they currently are will give you a perfectly functioning
    project, of course, but there is always room to expand and should you choose to
    extend and add functionality, you can do so easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conversely, each project can be disassembled and specific sections of code can
    be lifted out and used in completely different projects that are totally separate
    to this book. I've done this in several ways—as much as possible, the code is
    kept verbose and simple. The code is kept in small, manageable blocks; I've tried
    to keep all code as close to the examples of code used in the CodeIgniter documentation
    (so hopefully, it will follow a familiar flow and appearance).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've also tried to document each project. The beginning of each chapter will
    contain wireframes, sitemaps, file tree layouts, and data dictionaries of every
    table in each project, and in the code itself, I have added explanations of the
    code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I try to discuss why something is there rather than just a stale explanation
    of what something is; this is done in the hope that explaining why something is
    there will help you understand how relevant the code is to whatever change or
    amendment you might have in mind.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction and Shared Project Resources"),
    *Introduction and Shared Project Resources*, introduces you to this book and documents
    an initial development environment—installing Twitter Bootstrap, installing CodeIgniter,
    and developing a few shared common resources used by all chapters throughout the
    book.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. A URL Shortener"), *A URL Shortener*, talks
    about creating an application that allows a user to enter a URL. The application
    will encode this URL and generate a new, shorter URL with a unique code appended
    to it—this will then be saved to a database. This URL will be offered to the user
    for them to distribute and use. Once it is clicked on, the application we will
    develop will look at the URL, find the unique code in that URL, and look for it
    in the database. If found, the application will load the original URL and redirect
    the user to it.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Discussion Forum"), *Discussion Forum*, talks
    about creating an application that will allow users to create an initial question
    or proposition. This question will be displayed on a type of notice board; this
    is the beginning of a discussion thread. Other users are able to click on these
    users'' discussions and reply to them should they wish.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Creating a Photo-sharing Application"), *Creating
    a Photo-sharing Application*, talks about creating a small application that will
    allow a user to upload an image. A unique URL is then generated and saved to the
    database along with details of the uploaded file. It is offered to the user for
    them to distribute. Once the URL is clicked on, the uploaded image is fetched
    from the filesystem and displayed to the user.'

    a Newsletter Signup*, contains a project that allows a user to register to a database
    of contacts, in this case, a database of newsletter signups. The user can amend
    their settings (the settings can be anything you wish: the type of e-mail content
    they wish to receive or whether they wish to receive HTML or text-only e-mails).
    The application even supports unsubscribing from future newsletters.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Creating an Authentication System"), *Creating
    an Authentication System*, contains an application to manage users in a system
    you might develop and is perhaps the largest chapter in the book. A simple CRUD
    environment is supplied, allowing you to add, edit, and delete users. In turn,
    users can register themselves and even reset their password should they forget
    it.'

    an E-Commerce Site*, talks about a small but concise e-commerce application that
    utilizes CodeIgniter''s Cart class to support a simple shop. Users can filter
    products via different categories, add products to their cart, amend items in
    the carts (adjust item quantities), or remove items from their cart altogether.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Creating a To-do List"), *Creating a To-do
    List*, talks about creating an application that allows a user to create tasks
    that they need to complete. Tasks can be given a due date, that is, a kind of
    deadline date. The tasks are displayed in an HTML table. The rows of late tasks
    are given a red background color to indicate their importance. Complete tasks
    can be set as done and are indicated as being done by being struck through. Finally,
    tasks can be deleted to remove old and unwanted items.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Creating a Job Board"), *Creating a Job Board*,
    talks about creating a job board. Users are encouraged to post an advert on the
    job board by filling in an HTML form. The contents of the form are validated and
    added to a database of current available jobs. Other users looking for work can
    search for these jobs. These users can search through all jobs or enter a search
    query to see whether a specific job exists.'

    but that is by no means a barrier; don't forget, CodeIgniter is an easy-to-use
    framework and can be picked up quite easily.
