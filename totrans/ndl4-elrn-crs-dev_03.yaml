    organizations to opt into a cloud-based Moodle installation provided by a Moodle
    partner or [Moodlecloud.com](http://Moodlecloud.com). Your students will be accessing
    Moodle from an array of different devices, and Moodle 4.0's brand-new default
    theme, which is based on Boost, is completely responsive, with new **Site home**
    options and an easy-to-follow Dashboard. The result is a user experience that
    helps you stay organized, never miss a deadline, and always know how to get back
    to the last pages you visited.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2020, when the global pandemic forced educational institutions to offer courses
    online, many opted for synchronous solutions in which the bulk of the instruction
    took place via a web-conferencing application. A learning management system (such
    as Moodle) was then used as the repository of digital documents, assessments,
    and grade books. Students who formerly studied exclusively in face-to-face environments
    now had to navigate the unfamiliar territory of the online classroom and the learning
    management system. While it was a positive thing to be able to view one's instructor
    or classmates online via web-conferencing software such as BigBlueButton, Microsoft
    Teams, or Zoom, web conferencing alone was not enough. The best design brought
    together synchronous with asynchronous, with collaboration, interaction, and hands-on
    guided experimentation incorporated into the learning management system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, the dramatic shift to synchronous online instruction made
    it all the more apparent that the experience of web conference-based synchronous
    instruction and collaborative learning (discussions and team projects in breakout
    rooms) is dramatically different than the asynchronous experience. Learning is
    different without a "live" instructor presence, and students cannot see each other
    in real time. On the positive side, asynchronous is much more flexible because
    it can be self-paced and materials can be accessed on demand. With Moodle, you
    have the flexibility to offer synchronous, asynchronous, and blended solutions.
    For a more in-depth theoretical background and research findings, please refer
    to the rubrics and findings in *Quality Matters* ([https://www.qualitymatters.org/](https://www.qualitymatters.org/))
    or the UK's *Institute of Education* ([https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=3847](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=3847)).

    a student's ability to learn. You'll want to keep the learning objectives and
    outcomes first and foremost in the learner's mind, even as you're setting up your
    site and thinking about what should be visible to the students. Then, you'll want
    to ensure that they know what they should be doing next and how this ties to the
    courses. Informing your decisions is the knowledge of what you'd like the students
    to accomplish. Specifically, this means you are thinking ahead about how you will
    clearly map the learning objectives to the course content, activities, and assessment.
    Mapping the learning objectives can be enhanced using storyboarding. The overall
    sight should make sense, and your learner should have an idea of how an activity
    or content will lead to the ability to perform a task and demonstrate skill or
    mastery.

    that corresponds to a unique ID for the institution, such as the user's email
    address, and you can also set up authentication methods, a password, and a unique
    profile. It is a good idea to set up username protocols and also authentication
    methods in a way that is uniform across all courses and programs in the institution.

    The **Default Dashboard** page contains a Timeline, which consists of activities

    by default, only activities taking place in the upcoming 7 days will show up.
    There is also the option to sort by dates and also to search by activity type
    or name. The calendar allows you to look at all the courses at once or just one
    at a time to be able to plan and stay up to date with assignments and other activities.

- en: Moodle 4.0 makes it easier for students, teachers, and administrators to navigate
    the platform by adding new navigation options and placing an activity history
    on the side of the Dashboard. Individuals and organizations that want to install
    a Standard version on their own servers can still do so, and they can enhance
    the global functionality with plugins. We also discussed Moodle Mobile, which
    is an app for Android users that enables them to access and use Moodle even when
    offline. In this chapter, we learned how to get started with Moodle, beginning
    with configuration and then selecting the available roles for users. We discussed
    the Dashboard's new features and also how Moodle 4.0 has enhanced the user experience.
    We covered the settings that, from experience, you are most likely to change.
    Many of these settings affect the behavior of the entire site. You don't need
    to get these choices perfect the first time because you can return to these settings
    and edit them at will. As you proceed with building your site, you will probably
    want to experiment with some of them. You will find that Moodle 4.0 is more customizable
    than ever.
