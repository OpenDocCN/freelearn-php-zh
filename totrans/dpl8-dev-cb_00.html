<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "<span>You will see</span> <kbd>drupal-org.make</kbd> <span>and</span> <kbd>drupal-org-core.make</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre> public function alterRoutes(RouteCollection $collection) { 
    // Change path of mymodule.mypage to use a hyphen 
    if ($route = $collection-&gt;get('mymodule.mypage')) </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>  $ CREATE USER username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';</strong></pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "<span>Check the checkbox and click on</span> <span class="packt_screen">Install</span>."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
