- en: The topic of website security can be an intimidating one. On the one hand, we
    all want our websites to be secure, but, on the other, we fear that we might not
    have the skills to battle hackers trying to break into our sites. But hold off
    on that thought for a second; why would anyone even attack your site in the first
    place?! You're not a financial institution or a popular online publication, so
    why would anyone care to spend their time trying to harm your site?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, the reality can be harsh in this case. Most hacker attacks are not about
    stealing your revenue or taking over your site as a whole. Usually, they are about
    including a small piece of code on your site that links out to other external
    sites (most of the time, either fraudulent sites or *naughty* content). What does
    the hacker get out of it? This varies, but usually, those kinds of attacks are
    done to use your site as part of a network that is meant to achieve a specific
    goal. Effectively, your site becomes a zombie—it does whatever the hacker tells
    it to do, and it's part of a bigger network of similar *zombie sites*.

    let's set some groundwork in place. Your number one objective is to set the most
    fundamental elements in place so that you can avoid 99% of the attacks. Remember
    that the hackers are not targeting your site individually. Instead, they target
    a whole cluster of sites and aim to take advantage of known vulnerabilities. Therefore,
    if you erase that given vulnerability from your site, then you're effectively
    preventing the attack from happening.

    belongs to, and is used by, just one person. However, many blogs are used differently—there
    may be a single blog or website with a variety of writers, editors, and administrators.
    This makes the site more like a community project or even an online magazine.
    Also, it's by no means uncommon for bigger online publishers to use WordPress
    as the base of their websites, in which case the site has a number of authors,
    editors, reviewers, and overall contributors with varying responsibilities, not
    to mention the technical staff or designers. All those people should have their
    own user accounts when interacting with the site.

    to be able to write and publish new posts or pages, and they don't need admin

    powers for you. This role is called *administrator*, and every WordPress site
    must have at least one admin account (you will not be allowed to delete them all).

    dozens of users.

    you'll see that it has all the credentials that you would need to publish any
    piece of content on a given WordPress site. This makes it perfect for everyday
    use, even for single-author blogs/sites. Therefore, what I actually encourage
    you to do is set a separate editor account for yourself, and then use it for posting
    and editing content, instead of working with the default administrator account.
    This setup is a lot safer, particularly if someone tries to hijack your password,
    or in the event of any other mishap to your account, the site itself won't get
    harmed (because editors can't install new plugins or delete any existing ones).

    | Discussion, blog visitors may have to sign up as subscribers in order to be
    able to post comments. Also, there are some plugins that handle sending info updates
