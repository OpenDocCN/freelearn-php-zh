    Its main use is to generate HTML dynamically to create web pages that are delivered
    to the client by the web server, as well as to store, retrieve, and manipulate
    data on the server. We have used files as the containers for that data, but we
    have given more than one hint that as soon as the amount of data becomes large
    and/or complex, we want to use a database instead.

- en: A database is nothing more than a collection of data, usually organized in some
    structured way. We use databases everyday although we might not think of them
    as databases. Take a phone directory, for instance. It contains a lot of data.
    The data itself consists of names, addresses, and, of course, phone numbers, typically
    sorted by last name. This paper database has many disadvantages, though. Once
    it is printed, it will be incomplete and out of date. And if we want to look up
    the phone numbers of all the people that live in the same street, we would not
    know where to start. But it is a database, alright.

    Edgar Frank Codd, working at IBM at the time, called *A Relational Model of Data
    for Large Shared Data Banks*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It presents a model that shows the relationships between the different elements
    of data and heavily uses tables. In each of those tables, there are several fields
    or columns that can contain data of various types (strings, numbers, dates, and
    so on). Entries in those tables are called **rows**, and the first column in each
    row is an index or primary key, a number, which is usually not changed after it
    has been created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there can be a table containing customer information. The index represents
    the customer ID, and all the other columns or fields are classical things, such
    as first name, last name, address, and so on. You can easily create other tables
    and choose what they can contain. Let's assume that we are going to sell books.
    We could have a table with book information, starting with a book ID, book title,
    author, category (fiction or non-fiction, or more categories), ISBN number, price,
    whether it is hardcover, softcover, or an eBook, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could have a separate table for categories; one for authors too, and then,
    of course, a table for your order information. If you organize your data like
    this and use the customer, category, and book ID in your order information, you
    only need to change things in one place in your database when, for example, the
    customer changes address. The database you are going to learn about in this chapter
    works as we just described.

    like, to use a database and its tables instead of a flat file.

    on these computer screens was looking up things in a database, and that was mostly
    the only thing computers were used for. In our example, `CRIMINALS` is the name
    of a table and the `SELECT` command is used to look up all records where (hence

    `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. To accommodate getting data

    read, update, and delete (which is what CRUD stands for) records in a specific
