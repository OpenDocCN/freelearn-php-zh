<p>Developing plugins for WordPress is the next big thing for you if you are an administrator looking to enhance a personal site with custom functionality for which no plugin exists, a developer looking to enhance the WordPress platform with new ideas for the community, or a website designer building a specific project for a client. Learning how to create WordPress plugins will allow you to unleash the full potential of the most popular web content management system.</p>
<p>As an early WordPress adopter, before version 1.0 was out, I started building plugins to add functionality to my personal site. Once I got these new elements in place, I quickly realized that other users could benefit from these extensions, and started distributing them online. To this day, I always love hearing back from users of my creations and finding out how they have put them to use and what new functionality they think would make them even better.</p>
<p>While developing plugins might initially sound a little bit like black magic, this book shows you how easy creating plugins actually is through a series of step-by-step recipes. If you have previously added code to a theme's functions file, you may even be familiar with some of the mechanics explained in this book. With all of the information contained in this book, you will quickly be able to create your own plugins or dissect existing ones to add that extra bit of missing functionality that you require. Before you know, you'll be publishing your own creations to the official WordPress plugin repository!</p>
<p>Let's start learning how to cook up great WordPress plugins!</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "create a text file called <kbd>uninstall.php</kbd> in the <kbd>ch8-bug-tracker</kbd> directory and open it in a code editor."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>add_filter( 'the_generator', 'ch2gf_generator_filter', 10, 2 );</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre> echo '&lt;tr style="background: #FFF"&gt;'; <br/><strong> echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" name="bugs[]" value="'; </strong><br/><strong> echo intval( $bug_item['bug_id'] ) . '" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;';</strong> <br/> echo '&lt;td&gt;' . $bug_item['bug_id'] . '&lt;/td&gt;';</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "<span>Here, we added an inner grid with two full-size columns; one for the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Price</span> <span>of an item and the other will wrap up the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Quantity</span> <span>component.</span>"</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
