- en: For the past few years, I’ve been helping friends and colleagues learn more
    about PHP and **Test-Driven Development** (**TDD**). I realized that I found myself
    repeating some of the things I’m discussing with different people. I told myself,
    it would be great if I could just point my friends and colleagues to a collection
    of my notes so that I could help them with developing applications in PHP from
    the start of the project, up to deployment. Unfortunately, my notes only made
    sense to me.

- en: In 2009, I was working as a C# developer and made friends with my colleagues
    who were fellow programming enthusiasts. Unfortunately, we haven’t been in touch
    for a long time. 11 years later, in 2020 while in COVID lockdown, I got in touch
    with my long-lost friends, and we started chatting about programming. They told
    me that they were very keen on learning about TDD with PHP. We then did a screen-sharing
    tutorial session on a weekend, and I realized that I seriously needed to start
    writing something a bit more organized to help other people who are interested
    in learning about this topic.

- en: I do self-training most of the time. I buy books, read them, and watch tutorials
    about things I want to learn myself. I then decided to write a book about TDD
    with PHP. Since I have learned a lot from the books published by Packt, I thought
    I should reach out to them.

    you need to build for a project as a software developer. You will learn how to
    write and use automated tests to help improve the quality of the software you
    produce, and you will also learn how to use tools to automate the execution of
    your tests, as well as the deployment of your code onto remote servers. I’m aiming
    for the reader to understand the value of TDD as a process, and not just learn
    about writing automated tests. That’s why I have covered topics from starting
    a project to deploying it on a public-facing server.

- en: If you’re a professional PHP developer who’s getting tired of working on applications
    that are not easily testable or maintainable, this book will help you be a better
    professional PHP developer. You will learn how to utilize **Test-Driven Development**
    (**TDD**) and **Behaviour-Driven Development** (**BDD**) to help you produce more
    structured and maintainable software.

    it. This chapter will also make you understand the value of TDD in large projects
    and how it helps reduce regressions.'
