<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Introduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref03"/>Introduction</h1></div></div></div><p>Object-oriented programming is largely about the ability to hide what's not important to the user and to highlight what is. PHP 5 offers standardized means for specifying the variety of property scopes typically offered by full-featured OO languages.</p><div class="section" title="What This Book Covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec1000"/>What This Book Covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. OOP vs. Procedural Programming">Chapter 1</a> introduces object-oriented programming and how it fits for PHP. Some benefits of functional programming over procedural programming are highlighted.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Kick-Starting OOP">Chapter 2</a> you learn to create objects and define their properties and methods. Details of classes, properties, and methods follow, along with the scope of methods. This chapter shows you the benefits of using interfaces and a few other basic OOP features in PHP to kick start your journey through OOPing in PHP.</p><p>Now that you have got your basics done for OOP in PHP, <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. More OOP">Chapter 3</a> helps you to strengthen your base. It helps you to deal with more details and some advanced features. For example, you learn about class information functions, which allows you to investigate details of any class. This chapter takes you through some handy object-oriented information functions, exception handling, iterators, and storing objects using serialization. </p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Design Patterns">Chapter 4</a> you learn some of the Design Patterns and how to implement them in PHP. These are an essential part of OOP and make your code more effective, more efficient, and easier to maintain. Sometimes we implement these design patterns in our code without knowing that these solutions are defined by design patterns. Proper usage of the correct pattern can make your code perform better; similarly using them improperly could make your code slower and less efficient. </p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Reflection and Unit Testing">Chapter 5</a> focuses on two very important features of object-oriented programming in PHP, reflection and unit testing. PHP5 replaces many old APIs with smarter new ones. One of these is the Reflection API, with which you can reverse or engineer any class or object to figure out its properties and methods. You can invoke those methods dynamically and more. Unit testing is an essential part of good, stable, and manageable application design. We focus on one very popular package, PHPUnit, which is a port of JUnit to PHP. If you follow the guidelines provided in this chapter you will be able to design your own unit tests successfully.</p><p>Some built-in objects and interfaces in PHP make life much easier for PHP developers. In <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Standard PHP Library">Chapter 6</a> you will learn about the huge object repository named the Standard PHP Library or SPL.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Database in an OOP Way">Chapter 7</a>: In this chapter we discuss the improved MySQL API known as MySQLi and take a basic look at PHP Data Objects (PDO), adoDB, and PEAR::MDB2. We take a look at the Active Record pattern in PHP using adoDB’s active record library and the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) pattern using Propel. We focus on some specific topics that are interesting for PHP developers doing database access the OO way. </p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Cooking XML with OOP">Chapter 8</a>, you learn to process XML with PHP. You get to know about different APIs like the SimpleXML API to read XML and the DOMDocument object to parse and create XML documents. </p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Building Better with MVC">Chapter 9</a>: In Chapter 4 you learned how design patterns can simplify your daily life in programming by providing you with a common approach for solving problems. One of the most used design patterns for application architecture is Model-View-Controller (MVC). In this chapter we discuss the basic structure of MVC frameworks and then introduce you to some of these popular frameworks. Frameworks play a very important role in Rapid Development of PHP applications. You will learn how to build a framework in this chapter, which will also help you to understand object loading, data abstraction layers, and the importance of separation and finally you get a closer look at how applications are done.</p></div></div>

Code words in text are shown as follows: "In some cases you may need to investigate which classes are in the current scope. You can do it easily with <code class="literal">get_declared_classes()</code> function."</p><p>A block of code will be set as follows: </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?
