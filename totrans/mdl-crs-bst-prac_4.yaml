    resource is mobile-friendly and easy to print. It works very well with flow themes.
    It's convenient, particularly if you're using it for the course syllabus or an
    e-book text.

    a single location outside Moodle and then link it in Moodle.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the easiest ways to ensure that your students are able to obtain the
    same content is to upload the course material via separate files. Clustering files
    together will allow your students to find the material for your course easily.
    Typical files include text files along with graphics, audio files, videos, and
    presentations. Keep in mind that not everyone will have the same software. We
    recommend that you convert your content into a PDF format so that you can upload
    a PDF file rather than a PowerPoint file or a text file. This will ensure that
    the formatting and fonts stays the same for your intellectual property to be more
    easily preserved, because it is harder to copy graphics from a PDF file than from
    a PowerPoint file. If you convert the files to PDF, your students can open them
    if they have installed the free Adobe Acrobat Reader. The advantage is that the
    formatting and fonts will not change (as your students might have different versions
    of presentation and word-processing software).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that you are limited in terms of file size, so it is often a good
    idea to link to your files to a cloud-based host. If your organization uses shared
    content such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive, you can easily upload, and
    when the students log in via your organization's single sign-on, they will have
    access to them.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the Page resource, you're able to use the built-in web editor to create
    a simple website that can contain links, graphics, and embedded HTML codes. You
    can use an embedded HTML code and make it very easy for students to access cloud-based
    resources, such as videos on [YouTube.com](https://www.youtube.com/), audio on
    [SoundCloud.com](https://soundcloud.com/), presentations from [https://www.slideshare.net/](https://www.slideshare.net/),
    photos and graphics on [Flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/), and so on. The advantage
    of using these resources is that they are hosted in the cloud and do not take
    up your space on Moodle. Further, they are open resources and do not require logins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the embedded HTML code often contains players, it's possible to stream
    the media rather than having to wait for the files to download. The advantages
    of this include ease of access and saving time. The disadvantage is that you must
    be connected to the internet to stream the video files. You may prefer to download
    the files to your device in order to play them when you're not connected to the
    internet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Embedding presentations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use embedded HTML code for presentations as well. This is important
    for two reasons. First, you may wish to avoid bandwidth and problems caused due
    to slow download by hosting in the cloud. So, in that case, using services such
    as [https://www.slideshare.net/](https://www.slideshare.net/) can be a lifesaver.
    Second, you may wish to protect intellectual property by not making it too easy
    to copy sensitive (and popular) graphics, charts, maps, and so on. In that case,
    you can protect yourself by making the presentation available in PDF format rather
    than PowerPoint or another easily copied and dissected format. It does not prevent
    your ideas from being stolen, but at least it slows down people with ill intent
    and makes it more difficult for them to copy and paste items.
  prefs: []

- en: For another layer of safety, you can record yourself giving your presentation
    on [BigBlueButton.org](https://bigbluebutton.org/) (a webinar program that is
    open source with free downloads for Moodle installations after Moodle 3.0) or,
    alternatively, you can make a movie using a screen recording program such as Camtasia
    or [https://screencast-o-matic.com/](https://screencast-o-matic.com/). Then, you
    can upload your presentation to [YouTube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/),
    where it will be very difficult for anyone to copy your intellectually unique
    graphics.

    downside is that it's fairly labor-intensive to use the Forum activity to distribute
