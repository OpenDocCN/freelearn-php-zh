<p><em>How do I make a website?</em> is a question that a lot of people ask in this day and age. Actually, it's probably one of <em>the</em> main questions you ask if you're a business owner in the 21st century. But <em>website making</em> is not only about business.</p>
<p>These days, dare I say, <em>everybody</em> should at least <em>consider</em> getting a website of their own. In the past, this was an intimidating concept. The only way you could get a website was to either hire a professional who would build one for you, or learn web technologies and development yourself and then build one on your own. Nowadays, there are <em>more</em> options, and particularly if you want to build a website <em>really quickly</em> while making sure that it is <em>top quality</em> at the same time.</p>
<p>The best option of them all is WordPress—which is the topic of this book. Under the hood, WordPress is an open source web software application that you can use to create and maintain a modern website. At the time of writing, more than 30% of all websites run on WordPress, and the number is only expected to increase in the coming years. In simple terms, with WordPress, anyone can build a beautiful website with minimal effort involved and then make it available to the world in no time. Let's take a look at some of the perks of using WordPress:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't need to hire a team of developers and/or designers</li>
<li>You don't need to learn advanced PHP</li>
<li>You don't need to be a pro with computers</li>
<li>Nevertheless, you can still end up with a high-quality website with almost unlimited extension possibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>These days, everyone has a good reason to have a website. It's not just large companies anymore. Individuals, families, freelancers, or small/independent businesses can all benefit from a website. However, at the same time, most people don't have the financial resources to hire a web development company or a freelance web developer to create a website for them. This is where WordPress comes into play. WordPress is free, easy to use, and packed with excellent features. Since WordPress is a web application, it does not need to be installed on your home PC or Mac, or any other machine under your control. It can live on a server (kind of a computer) that belongs to a website-hosting company. Originally, WordPress was an application meant to run a blog website. However, it has evolved into a fully featured <strong>content management system </strong>(<strong>CMS</strong>). If you don't know what a blog is, don't worry, we explain everything later in this chapter.</p>
<p>In this book, we'll be going through each important step on your way to understanding how WordPress works and what can be done with it. We'll learn about the basic usage of WordPress, configuration, extending your site with themes and plugins, and much more. But before we can get to all that, we need to start at square one! In this chapter, we'll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reasons that will make you choose WordPress to run your website</li>
<li>The greatest advantages of WordPress</li>
<li>Online resources for WordPress</li>
<li>Some of the most useful features in the newest versions of WordPress</li>
</ul>

<p>WordPress is an open source CMS. <strong>Open source</strong> means that the source code of the system is made available with a license whereby the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose (as Wikipedia defines it). CMS means a software application that can run a website (for example, a blog) and allows you to publish, edit, and modify the content. It's a piece of software that lives on the web server (more on what a web server is later on) and makes it easy for you to add and edit posts, themes, comments, and all of your other content. The following is the logo of WordPress:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/96f66e5b-adca-4880-bafc-9566779c1f4b.png" style="width:17.83em;height:4.58em;" width="1754" height="452"/></p>
<p>Even though WordPress was originally a blog engine—used primarily to run blogs—it's now a popular solution among some of the biggest brands on the web and runs their entire websites. Brands such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Reuters, <a href="http://wired.com">WIRED.com</a>, Sony, Toyota, plus some of the most prominent artists (such as Beyoncé  or the Rolling Stones) all use WordPress as the base of their web platforms and outlets.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, WordPress has evolved a lot over the years, and even though a large number of new functionalities have been introduced, WordPress remains one of the easiest-to-use web publishing platforms out there. Originally, it was a fork of an older piece of software named <strong>b2/cafelog</strong>.</p>
<p>WordPress was developed by Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little, but is now maintained and developed by a team of developers that includes Mullenweg.</p>

<p>There are generally three popular types of website for which WordPress is meant to be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A typical website with relatively static content, pages, subpages, and so on</li>
<li>A blog website, chronologically organized, and frequently updated, categorized, tagged, and archived</li>
<li>An e-commerce website: a fully functional online store that allows people to buy goods or services, and the website owner to manage orders and fulfill them</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as experience shows, WordPress is also successfully used to run a wide variety of other sites, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporate business sites</li>
<li>One-page profile sites</li>
<li>Portfolio sites</li>
<li>Membership sites</li>
<li>Video blogs</li>
<li>Photo blogs</li>
<li>Product sites</li>
<li>Education sites (e-courses) and more</li>
</ul>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with blog websites and blogging terminology, let's take a look at the basics.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Starting the journey – what is a blog?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Originally, <em>blog</em> was short for <em>weblog</em>. According to Wikipedia, the term weblog was first used in 1997, and people started using blogs globally in 1999. The terms <em>weblog</em>, <em>web blogging</em>, and <em>weblogger</em> were added to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> in 2003, though these days most people leave off the <em>we</em> part.</p>
<p>Just to give you a more plain-English explanation, a blog is a website that usually contains regular entries made by an author. These entries can be of various types, such as commentary, descriptions of events, photos, videos, personal remarks, tutorials, case studies, long opinion pieces, political ideas, or whatever else you can imagine. They are usually displayed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent additions at the top. Those entries can be organized in a variety of ways, by date, topic, subject, and so on.</p>
<p>One of the main characteristics of a blog is that it's meant to be updated regularly. Unlike a website where the content is static, a blog behaves more like an online diary, wherein the blogger posts regular updates. Hence, blogs are dynamic with ever-changing content. A blog can be updated with new content and the old content can be changed or deleted at any time (although deleting content is not a common practice).</p>
<p>Most blogs focus their content on a particular subject, for example, current events, hobbies, niche topics, and technical expertise. This doesn't mean that blogs are meant to be published only by individuals sharing their personal opinions on given matters. On the contrary, these days, blogs have become a significant part in the online presence for many businesses and even corporations. The modern practice of <em>content marketing</em> is now one of the most widely accepted web marketing methods, and its core is based on publishing quality content, often in blog form.</p>

<p>If you are new to the world of blogging (sometimes called the <em>blogosphere</em>, which is a fairly popular expression these days), you may want to familiarize yourself with the following common terms.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Each entry in the blog is called a <strong>post</strong>. Every post usually has a number of different parts. Of course, the two most obvious parts are the title and content. The <strong>content</strong> is text, images, links, and so on. Posts can even contain multimedia (for example, videos and audio files). Every post also has a publication timestamp, and most have one or more categories and tags assigned to them. It is these posts, or entries, that are often displayed in reverse chronological order on the main page of the blog. By default, the latest post is displayed first, in order to give the viewer the latest news on a subject.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Categories</strong> and <strong>tags</strong> are ways to organize and find posts within a blog and even across blogs. Categories are like topics, while tags are more like keywords. For example, for a blog about food and cooking, there might be a category called <strong>recipes</strong>, but every post in that category might have different tags (for example, <em>soup</em>, <em>baked</em>, <em>vegetarian</em>, and <em>dairy-free</em>).</p>
<p>The purpose and correct usage of tags and categories are one of the widely discussed topics among bloggers. Although there are basic guidelines such as the ones presented here, every blogger develops their own approach after a while, and there are no <em>written in stone</em> rules.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Most blogs allow visitors to post comments on the posts. This gives readers the opportunity to interact with the author of the blog, thus making the whole experience interactive. Often, the author of the blog will respond to comments by posting additional comments with a single click on the reply button, which makes for a continuous public online conversation or dialog.</p>
<p>Comments are said to be one of the most important assets for a blog. The presence of a large number of comments shows how popular and authoritative the blog is.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>A <strong>theme</strong> is the design and layout package that you can choose for your blog. On most blogs, the content (for example, posts) is separate from the visual appearance. This means you can change the visuals of your blog at any time without having to worry about the content being affected. One of the best things about themes is that it takes only minutes to install and start using a new one. Moreover, there are a number of very good free or low-cost themes available online.</p>
<p>That being said, you need to be careful when working with free themes from uncertain developers. Often, they contain encrypted parts and code that can hurt your site and its presence on Google. Always look for user reviews before choosing a theme. Most importantly, the safest bet is getting your free themes only from the official WordPress directory at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a>. The themes there have been tested and checked for any suspicious code.</p>

<p>WordPress plugins are relatively small pieces of web software that can be installed on any WordPress site. They extend the native functionality to do almost anything that the technology of today allows. Just like WordPress itself, the code within plugins is open source, which means that anyone can build a new plugin if they have the required skill set. Every WordPress website or blog can work with an unlimited number of plugins (although it is not a recommended approach). The most popular functionalities introduced through plugins include spam protection, <strong>search engine optimization</strong> (<strong>SEO</strong>), caching, social media integration, interactive contact forms, and backups.</p>

            <article>
                
<p><strong>Widgets</strong> are a simplified version of plugins. The most common usage of widgets is to have them showcased in the sidebars on your site. Typically, your current theme will provide you with a number of widget areas where you can display widgets (as mentioned, many of these are located in the sidebar). Some of the common usages for widgets is to display content such as categories and tags, recent posts, popular posts, recent comments, links to archived posts, pages, links, search fields, or standard non-formatted text.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>We need to talk some history to explain the meaning of menus in WordPress. Back in the day, WordPress didn't allow much customization in terms of tweaking navigation menus and handpicking the links we wanted to display. This changed in Version 3.0, whereby the new <em>Custom Menus</em> feature was introduced. In plain English, it allows you to create completely custom menus (featuring any links of your choice) and then display them in specific areas on your site. To be honest, this feature, even though it sounds basic, is one of the main ones that has turned WordPress into a full-fledged web publishing platform. I promise this will sound much clearer in the upcoming chapters.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>It's important to understand the difference between a page and a post. Unlike posts, pages do not depend on timestamps and are not displayed in reverse chronological order. Also, they do not have categories or tags. A page is a piece of content with only a title and content (an example would be <em>About Me</em> or <em>Contact Us—</em>the two most popular pages on almost any blog). It is likely that the number of pages on your blog remains relatively static, while new posts can be added every day or so.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>A <strong>home page</strong> is simply the main page that visitors see when they visit your website by typing in your domain name or URL address. In the early days of WordPress's existence, a home page wasn't something we used to talk about as a separate kind of page. Originally, a home page was generated automatically from the newest posts—it was a listing of those posts in reverse chronological order. Right now, however, WordPress allows us to build a completely custom home page and display whatever content we wish on it.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>As mentioned earlier, WordPress is now a complete web publishing platform. One of its characteristics is that it is capable of working with multiple user accounts, not just a single account belonging to the owner (admin/main author) of the site. There are different types of user accounts available, and they have different credentials and access rights.</p>
<p>WordPress is clearly trying to resemble a traditional publishing house where there are <em>authors</em>, <em>editors</em>, and other <em>contributors</em> all working together. Even though the option to create an unlimited number of user accounts won't be that impressive for anyone planning to manage a site on their own, it can surely be a more-than-essential feature for big, magazine-like websites.</p>

<p>WordPress is not the only publishing platform out there, but it has an awful lot to offer. In the following sections, I've called attention to WordPress's most outstanding features.</p>
<p>The main benefits of WordPress summarized are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress <em>gives you full control over your website</em>. You can change/adjust/modify/customize everything, and I mean everything, about your site.</li>
<li>There are <em>thousands of themes and plugins</em> to choose from, enabling you to make your website look and work however you wish. WordPress is extremely extendable. Basically, any additional functionality that you can dream of can be added utilizing a plugin that you or your programmer friends can write.</li>
<li>The day-to-day work with <em>the platform is very easy to grasp</em>. Tasks such as editing content, publishing new articles/posts, or interacting with the audience through comments have no learning curve.</li>
<li><em>WordPress is open source</em>. There's no price tag on the platform; you can get it for free. This also means that learning how the platform works under the hood, and how to extend it even further, doesn't require anyone's permission.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, if you need a website, and you want to be able to build it yourself, then WordPress is the platform that will make it possible.</p>
<p>WordPress is the perfect tool, both for beginners just dipping their toes into website building for the first time, and developers working on client websites professionally.</p>
<p>WordPress has been around for quite a while and has been in development the whole time. Developers are working on WordPress constantly to keep it ahead of spammers and hackers, and to <em>evolve</em> the application on the basis of the <em>evolving</em> needs of its users.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">WordPress's very first release, Version 0.70, was launched in May 2003. Since then, it has had more than two dozen major releases, with a number of minor ones in between. Each release came with more features and better security. Each major release comes with a code name honoring a great jazz musician, and this has become a tradition in the WordPress world.</div>
<p>WordPress is not being developed by a lonely programmer in a dark basement room, by the way. On the contrary, there is a large community of people working on it collaboratively by developing, troubleshooting, making suggestions, and testing the application. With such a large group of people involved, the application is likely to continue to evolve and improve without pause.</p>

<p>WordPress, as a platform and as a community of users, has grown in two main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is gathered around WordPress.org (<a href="https://wordpress.org/">https://wordpress.org/</a>), the native, main website of the WordPress project</li>
<li>The other is WordPress.com (<a href="https://wordpress.com/">https://wordpress.com/</a>), a commercial platform providing both free and paid blogs to users</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> is about developing the platform itself, sharing new plugins, discussing the technical aspects of WordPress, and being all <em>techie</em> in general. <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> is a commercial website where bloggers can meet with each other and publish their blog content under the <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> subdomain (for example, something like <kbd>paleorecipeslog.wordpress.com</kbd> is a subdomain).</p>
<p>In <a href="2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Getting Started with WordPress</em>, we will discuss the differences between hosting your blog on <a href="http://WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> versus working with the software you can get from <a href="http://WordPress.com">WordPress.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see detailed lists of all the new features added to WordPress, just take a look into the Codex. You can easily find the subpage for each individual version. Simply take the following web address and replace <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>Y</kbd> with the version number you're looking for.</p>
<p><kbd>https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_X.Y</kbd></p>
<p>For example, if you want to learn about WordPress 5.0, go to:</p>
<p><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_5.0">https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_5.0</a></p>
<p>Also, you can read a fully explained feature list at <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/features/">https://wordpress.org/about/features/</a>.</p>

<p>One very useful characteristic of WordPress is that it has a large, active, online community. Everything you will ever need for your WordPress website can most likely be found online, and probably for free. In addition to this, these days we can also find many paid resources and training programs that offer expert advice and training, revolving around many different possible usages of a WordPress site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/">https://codex.wordpress.org/</a>: Here you can find the official documentation for WordPress—we'll talk more about the codex later on in this chapter</li>
<li><a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/">https://themeisle.com/blog/</a>: Offers free guidance on common tasks that can be performed with WordPress</li>

<p>As WordPress is constantly being developed, it's important to keep yourself up-to-date with the software community's latest activities.</p>
<p>If you visit the dashboard of your own WordPress site regularly, you'll be able to stay up-to-date with WordPress news and software releases. There are widgets on the dashboard that display the latest news and announcements, and an alert always appears when there is a new version of WordPress available for download and installation.</p>
<p>If you prefer to visit the website, then the most important spot to visit or subscribe to is WordPress Releases. Whenever there is a new release, be it a major release, or an interim bug fix, or an upgrade, it will be at <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/">https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/</a>.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to stay tuned to the main WordPress blog at <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/">https://wordpress.org/news/</a>.</p>

<p>The WordPress <strong>Codex</strong> is the central repository of all the information that the official WordPress team has published to help people work with WordPress.</p>
<p>The Codex has some basic tutorials for getting started with WordPress, such as a detailed step-by-step discussion of the installation, and lists of every template tag and hook. Throughout this book, I'll be providing links to specific pages within the Codex, which will deliver more or advanced information on the topics in this book.</p>
<p>The Codex can be found at <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page</a>. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Apart from the Codex, there's also one more resource that will come in handy to new and experienced developers alike. It's called the WordPress <em>Code Reference</em>, and it can be found at <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/">https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/</a>. It delivers a lot of documentation on WordPress's functions, classes, methods, and hooks.</p>

<p>The online WordPress community asks questions and responds with solutions on the WordPress forum at <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">https://wordpress.org/support/</a>. It's an excellent place to go if you can't find the answer to a problem in the codex. If you have a question, then probably someone else has had it as well, and WordPress experts spend time in the forum answering them and providing solutions.</p>

<p>There are official directories for themes and plugins on <a href="http://WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a>. Though not every theme and plugin is available there, the ones that are, have been vetted by the community and the review teams. Anything you download from these directories is likely to be relatively bug-free. Plugins and themes that you get from other sources can have malicious code, so be careful. You can also see what the community thinks of these downloads by looking at ratings, comments and popularity metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find the <span class="packt_screen">Theme Directory</span> at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">https://wordpress.org/themes/</a></li>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">Plugin Directory</span> is located at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Following is the screenshot for the WordPress <span class="packt_screen">Theme Directory</span>: </p>
