            <article>
                
<p>In the previous chapter, you saw different types of non-blog websites. This chapter is a continuation of that topic, so let's do two things. First, let's go through some of the more trendy uses of WordPress and focus on a step-by-step process for reaching a great final result. Then, let's discuss some of the custom content elements you can create in WordPress, such as custom post types, custom taxonomies, and the process of customizing the admin display slightly. We will study the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-commerce stores</li>
<li>Video blogs and photo blogs</li>
<li class="h1">Social networks</li>
<li class="h1">Introducing custom post types</li>
</ul>

<p>E-commerce stores, in general, are websites where anyone can browse through a number of products and then use a shopping cart to make a purchase. Also, most e-commerce stores offer some kind of online payment integration, which allows every visitor to make and complete a purchase quickly. Additionally, sometimes there's even a backend inventory management system (an online warehouse of sorts) to make backend business management easier and integrated with the website.</p>

<p>The best thing about e-commerce is that you can actually launch a fully functional online store with WordPress. This, in my opinion, is simply incredible! As a former website developer, I actually remember how expensive and time-consuming it was to build such a store from the ground up. And now, you can just install WordPress, get a proper theme, download a specialized e-commerce plugin, and you're good to go! This is a prime example of how technology helps you to run your business the modern way.</p>
<p>Okay, enough with the intro. Let's focus on the actual process of building a quality e-commerce store. First off, the thing with e-commerce stores on WordPress is that they are extremely plugin-driven, so to speak. What I mean is that if you want to launch such a website, you will need to get one main e-commerce plugin that's going to be responsible for the complete set of operations available in your store. In short, this plugin will run your store. For that reason, choosing the right plugin is extremely important, which is something I'm sure you understand.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting a good e-commerce plugin</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are numerous premium plugins on the market. They offer a ton of features and integrate with almost any online payment processing method available. But, what's actually quite surprising is that the most popular plugin of them all is 100% free. It's called <strong>WooCommerce</strong>, and it has become the <em>de facto</em> standard for running an e-commerce store on WordPress.</p>
<p>WooCommerce (available either at <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">https://woocommerce.com/</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/</a>) is beautifully designed and offers a truly exceptional range of features, which I will get into in a minute. The main reason why I like the WooCommerce plugin so much is because it can be integrated with any theme. And I really do mean <em>any</em>. However, for a real-life business website (not just a test website, like the one we're going to build in a minute), I still think that you should use an optimized e-commerce theme. Again, feel free to visit one of the popular theme stores to get something of top quality. I listed a number of them in <a href="ffd72a00-558a-4dfc-a5c2-83f6051196a7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Choosing and Installing Themes</em>.</p>
<p>In short, a good e-commerce theme should achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear design</li>
<li>Present the center content block in an attention-grabbing way (this is where the products are going to be displayed)</li>
<li>Allow you to tune the number of sidebars you want to display</li>
<li>Be responsive (that is, viewable on any device)</li>
<li>Have a good navigation structure that's ready to house hundreds, if not thousands, of subpages (usually product pages)</li>
<li>Handle multilingual content</li>
<li>Provide some level of social media integration (to allow users to share product links on Twitter or Facebook)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to summarize this introduction, to give a head start in running an e-commerce store on WordPress, you need to pair the WooCommerce plugin with a good-looking WordPress theme that's optimized to work on an e-commerce website.</p>

<p>Among the first things that you need to do is create some of the mandatory pages that allow your website to transform into a fully-fledged e-commerce store. Luckily, WooCommerce takes care of this for you<span>—</span>all you have to do is click on the <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> button. You will get the following pages:</p>

<li><span class="packt_screen">Shop</span>: Your main shop page<span>—</span>this is where your products are going to appear</li>

            <article>
                
<p>The next step is setting up your store location. This is quite simple, since you only need to select where your store is based and which currency it will use. Additionally, if you're going to be charging sales tax, you can set that up there too, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>The next screen in the WooCommerce wizard is about setting up your shipping details, along with weight and dimension units. After that, you get to set the payment methods that your store will use.

            <article>
                
<p>The next step in the process, a very important step, is picking a design for your store. One of the best ways to get started here is to go with the official WooCommerce theme, called <span class="packt_screen">Storefront</span>. This theme can be installed with a click on the right from the WooCommerce wizard, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/2e03bb3a-99dc-4a82-8356-812c21cbcf20.png" style="width:29.92em;height:43.17em;" width="993" height="1439"/></p>
<p>Once you get <span class="packt_screen">Storefront</span> installed, the setup process is complete and the store is fully operational, as in, you can begin adding your first products.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>When it comes to products, WooCommerce follows the standard content organization method in WordPress. This means that you can manage products just like you'd manage any other piece of content (pages or posts). All you have to do is perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Products</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> and fill out the product fields. Notice that products also have their own categories and tags, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Once you have a handful of products added, the following screenshot shows what the <span class="packt_screen">Products</span> | <span class="packt_screen">All Products</span> section of your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> panel is going to look like:</li>

            <article>
                
<p>The last element of the plugin worth discussing here for a minute is the management backend<span>—</span>the orders, coupons, and reports.</p>
<p>Orders can be found in <span class="packt_screen">WooCommerce</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Orders</span>. You can manage them just like any other piece of WordPress content. There are a number of additional fields and parameters, though, so there might be a slight learning curve. But it is still a very friendly and easy-to-use environment. An example of what orders look like is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1472b97c-3c35-4cec-b913-1111fd8b1342.png" width="1412" height="568"/></p>
<p>To view and create new coupon codes, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">WooCommerce</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Coupons</span>. Coupons are a great way to bring new people to your store. Everyone loves a bargain, don't they? Or, you can make your coupon codes publicly available on the internet as a promotional method.</p>
<p>Lastly, to view reports, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">WooCommerce</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Reports</span>. There's a nice graphical representation of what's been going on in your store. You can view sales, coupons used, customer activity, and your current stock. Right now, I don't have much going on in my store, so the graph looks like the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6c729ba8-e784-4779-b4b3-0f933a965fa9.png" width="1662" height="1161"/></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">To learn more about managing orders and coupons, look at these official pages in the WooCommerce docs:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/">https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/coupon-management/">https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/coupon-management/</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>That's pretty much it on the topic of using WooCommerce and launching a nice e-commerce store on WordPress. The most remarkable thing here is how easy it is to actually do it. Just imagine how much time it would take to create something with similar functionality from the ground up. Or, better yet, the cost required to set it up. The possibilities that WordPress and various plugins deliver these days are really incredible. I'm sure that a couple of years ago, no one would even believe that launching a quality e-commerce store could be done this easily.</p>
<p>One last thing, WooCommerce is not entirely free all the time. If you want to install additional features, the official extensions are anything between $29 and $99. So, for some specific, real-world applications, investments might be required.</p>
<p>We've only scretched the surface here, and there's a lot more that WooCommerce can do. It is a truly impressive piece of software, and it's absolutely exceptional when it comes to giving you reliable e-commerce functionality that turns your otherwise standard WordPress website into a professional e-commerce store. If you want to learn more about building a store with WooCommerce from scratch, the best place to get your information is probably the official docs section at <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/">https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/</a>.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Video blogs and photo blogs</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's cover these two types of WordPress sites together because the individual goals for each are often very similar (although their designs may still be a bit different). In short, a video blog is one where the author mainly publishes videos, instead of traditional text-based posts. A photo blog, on the other hand, is essentially the same thing, the only difference being it revolves around photos.</p>
<p>Now, why would you even bother with a customized setup for a video blog or a photo blog in the first place when you can just use a standard WordPress installation with a traditional blogging-optimized theme? Well, to be honest here, you can indeed go with a standard setup, and your video/photo blog will be just about <em>fine</em>. But with some additional work (not much) put into building something that's tailor-made for multimedia blogs, your site can gain a big advantage over your competition, mostly in terms of usability and content presentation.</p>
<p>For instance, let's focus on the following interesting features you can add to a video blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blog home page built on a grid layout with big thumbnails, so every visitor can see the snapshots of the videos right away</li>
<li>Videos in the main listing presented as concise blocks containing the thumbnail and a small amount of text to convince people to click on the video</li>
<li>A wide main blog listing with just a narrow sidebar on the left (or right)</li>
<li>Integrated social media features (including YouTube subscription buttons)</li>
<li>Social media comments fetched from the platform where the video was originally hosted</li>
<li>A custom backend to host the videos on the blog (or on an external server)</li>
<li>A shareable embed code, so your visitors can embed the videos easily</li>
<li>A custom player to replace the native YouTube or Vimeo players</li>
</ul>
<p>You can have the following interesting features on a photo blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>A custom home page featuring one main photo (<em>a</em> <em>photo of the day</em>)</li>
<li>An automatic photo slider on the home page</li>
<li>Lightbox functionality for viewing the photos in full size</li>
<li>A wide main blog listing with integrated social media features</li>
<li>Social media comments</li>
<li>A custom backend to host photos</li>
<li>A shareable embed code</li>
<li>Custom photo controls (such as <em>save</em>, <em>view full size</em>, <em>share</em>, and so on)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, most of these features can work equally well on both video blogs and photo blogs. As usual with WordPress, you can get most of them either by obtaining a quality theme, or using some third-party plugins. Let's cover both of these approaches.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Being quite popular kinds of blogs, both video and photo blogs have a very wide range of themes available on the internet. But, be careful! Searching for a theme on Google can get you in trouble. Well, maybe not in <em>trouble</em> per se, but if you end up downloading a theme from a random site, you have no guarantee that it's a secure solution and that there's no malicious or encrypted code inside. A much better method is to either go to the official directory or to some of the recognized theme stores.</p>
<p>For starters, the following themes are available out there:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shapely</strong>, available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/shapely/">https://wordpress.org/themes/shapely/</a></li>
<li><strong>TheMotion Lite</strong>, available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/themotion-lite/">https://wordpress.org/themes/themotion-lite/</a></li>
<li><strong>RokoPhoto Lite</strong>, available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/rokophoto-lite/">https://wordpress.org/themes/rokophoto-lite/</a></li>
<li><strong>Activello</strong>, available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/activello/">https://wordpress.org/themes/activello/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are all free, but you can also get a premium theme. However, this will require an investment, so only do it if you're devoted to creating a really high-quality multimedia blog.</p>

<p>As I said, apart from video and photo optimized themes, you can also get a number of plugins that will make your site more functional. The good news is that we're only going to focus on free plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimole</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/optimole-wp/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/optimole-wp/</a>): This plugin doesn't present any particular output on the frontend of your site, because what it actually does is automatically optimizes your images in the background. This is a great plugin for saving your bandwidth, especially if you're publishing a lot of images. The installation process is quite standard. Once the plugin is activated and you've provided your free API key, it starts working in the background with no supervision required.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Lightbox</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-lightbox/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-lightbox/</a>): This plugin delivers a really good-looking lightbox functionality. The best thing about this plugin is that it's ultra easy to use. All you have to do is activate it, and it will immediately start taking care of the images you're displaying on your blog. The plugin will intercept image clicks and show the image file in a nice lightbox instead of loading them individually (on a blank page).</li>
<li><strong>Envira Gallery</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/envira-gallery-lite/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/envira-gallery-lite/</a>): This is one of the most popular gallery plugins for WordPress. It allows you to create responsive (optimized for desktop and mobile) photo and video galleries. The great thing about it is that you can build your galleries with drag and drop.</li>
<li><strong>10Web Instagram Feed</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wd-instagram-feed/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wd-instagram-feed/</a>): Instagram is now a crucial part of any photographer or videographer's presence on the web. This plugin offers you quick integration with everyone's favorite photo platform. Use it to showcase your Instagram feed as a widget.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to sum up the topic of multimedia blogs, I have to point out that this is a very crowded area among both theme and plugin developers. The plugins mentioned here will give you a good start, but having your finger on the pulse and paying attention to what's new on the market (as in, cool new plugins and themes) is actually the best way to keep your photo or video blog on top of its game. That being said, getting and testing every new plugin out there is not the recommended approach. Still, from time to time, you can find a true gem that's going to help you take your blog to the next level.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Finally, it's time to discuss one of the most surprising topics in relation to building various types of websites with WordPress. As it turns out, the platform can be used very well to run a fully functional social network. In other words, you can have your own Facebook if you want to, at least when it comes to functionality.</p>
<p>And speaking of functionality, in short, a social network built with WordPress can offer the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for any number of user accounts</li>
<li>Facebook-like publishing method for users (a <em>Wall</em> or an activity stream)</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>Blogs and microblogs</li>
<li>Friends</li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Private messages</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Photo and video content</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, building and then running a well-constructed social network, utilizing all of the available features, will require some serious work. This is way beyond the scope of this book. So, here, we're only going to focus on the basic setup process and getting started. If you're planning to launch an actual social network and make it available to the world, you should probably get more information, either by going to the official online documentation, or obtaining some more publications on the topic.</p>
<p>Essentially, social networking on WordPress works through one specific plugin—<strong>BuddyPress</strong>, although calling it just a plugin is a massive understatement. BuddyPress is a whole online publishing environment on its own, which integrates with WordPress. Unlike other plugins, it doesn't just display some custom content here and there. It actually changes the whole appearance (structure) of your WordPress site to make it look, and operate, like a social network.</p>
<p>Let's take the topic step by step, starting with installation.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There's nothing fancy here, to install a social network all you have to do is perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://buddypress.org/">https://buddypress.org/</a>, download the main plugin and then upload it to your WordPress site, or search for the plugin from within the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> panel (<span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>) using the name <kbd>BuddyPress</kbd>.</li>
<li>The installation process of the plugin itself is quite standard, meaning that after getting it on your server, you only have to click on the <span class="packt_screen">Activate</span> button.</li>
<li>When the process finishes, visit the settings section under <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">BuddyPress</span>. First, pick the components you'd like to use in your new social network. For testing purposes, I just enabled all of them, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/cbd30f1b-9fe6-496d-b782-43d5cf928e6c.png" style="width:59.58em;height:35.75em;" width="1498" height="899"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The second tab on this settings page, titled <span class="packt_screen">Options</span>, is where you can adjust some of the other standard settings, such as the presence of the top toolbar, various profile settings, and group settings.</li>
<li>Finally, the third tab, <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span>, lets you assign the pages that will house some standard areas of your social network, such as the activity stream, user groups, and member profiles.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can create new pages here or use the ones that BuddyPress created <span>already </span>during installation.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In its current form, BuddyPress can work with any WordPress theme. That's right, you don't have to have an optimized social networking design if you don't want to. BuddyPress will manage to display its contents inside either the main content block of your current theme, or the widget areas you have available.</p>
<p>However, as usual, if you want to make your social network look more professional, then you should probably look around and get something that's specifically optimized for social networks. The best rule of thumb when you're searching for such themes, in my opinion, is to compare them against the biggest social network of them all<span>—</span>Facebook. Although some people don't enjoy the design that Facebook offers, it is still the most successful social network around, so they are clearly doing something right. Treating it as a benchmark of sorts is, therefore, a very good idea.</p>
<p>If you want to find a nice list of BuddyPress-compatible themes, the WordPress directory comes to the rescue yet again. When you go to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/search/buddypress/">https://wordpress.org/themes/search/buddypress/</a>, you'll find a filtered list of themes that have been tested with BuddyPress and are optimized to work as a social network.</p>
<p>Once you've found yourself a nice-looking theme, you can go straight to working with your new social network without focusing any more on the setup. However, if you really want to get to know the platform and the way it's built, I advise you to go to the official documentation, which is one of the best BuddyPress resources available (<a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/">https://codex.buddypress.org/</a>). It's also where you can learn all the ins and outs of BuddyPress development, creating your own themes, or even BuddyPress extension plugins.</p>

<p>BuddyPress is constructed in a way that provides the basic social networking functionality and site organization. If you want to extend your social media site and give it some new features, you can install a number of BuddyPress plugins. You can find them at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/buddypress/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/buddypress/</a>. Basically, they are just like other WordPress plugins (the installation process is the same), but instead of delivering some new functionality to WordPress itself, they focus more on BuddyPress.</p>
<p>There is a lot more waiting for you inside BuddyPress, and I actually encourage you to do some researching and learning on your own, especially if you're planning to launch a social network at some point. But for now, I think that we've got the topic covered, at least when it comes to giving you an introduction to social networking with WordPress and getting started with the best social networking plugin available.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Introducing custom post types</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While building some of the sites described in the current and the previous chapters, you may stumble upon what're called custom post types. Or you may even decide to create them yourself for the purpose of your individual projects. But let's take it from the top. The most commonly known types of content in WordPress are <em>posts</em> and <em>pages</em>. However, if we feel that the situation/project calls for it, we can create any number of new post types by taking advantage of the custom post type functionality and its wide versatility.</p>
<p>The need for custom post types can appear in many scenarios. For instance, when a writer is building a personal portfolio site, they might need a custom post type named <kbd>book</kbd> to present their publications in an attractive way, instead of just using standard posts. This is exactly what we're about to do in this section of the chapter. So, gear up to learn how custom post types work by building a new one.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we'll go back to our main cooking blog theme<span>—</span><em>Daily Cooking Custom</em>. In its default form, it doesn't feature any custom post types, and that's a good thing as we've got a blank canvas to work on. To specify that you'd like to have a custom post type in your theme, you can add some code to your theme's <kbd>functions.php</kbd> file. This is what we'll be doing. However, keep in mind that you can also attach the custom post type to a plugin or a widget if you don't want it to be tied to a particular theme.</p>


            </article>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Registering a new post type</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To register a new post type, all you have to do is add some simple code to your theme's <kbd>functions.php</kbd> file. It's good practice to tie the creation of the new type to the <kbd>init</kbd> function of the theme so that it gets called at the right moment in the booting process. The following is the initial, blank, custom-post-type code:</p>
<pre>function book_init() { 
  register_post_type('book'); 
} 
add_action('init', 'book_init');</pre>
<p>The <kbd>register_post_type()</kbd> function takes an array as its second parameter, and in that array, you can specify whether the object is public or should be involved in rewriting the URL, what elements it supports on its editing page, and so on. Let's set up an array of all the arguments and then pass it to the function, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre>function book_init() { 
  $args = array( 
    'description' =&gt; 'A custom post type that holds my books', 
    'public' =&gt; true, 
    'rewrite' =&gt; array('slug' =&gt; 'books'), 
    'has_archive' =&gt; true, 
    'supports' =&gt; array('title', 'editor', 'author', 'excerpt', 
    'custom-fields', 'thumbnail'),
    'show_in_rest' =&gt; true  
  );
  register_post_type('book', $args);  
  flush_rewrite_rules(); 
} 
add_action('init', 'book_init');</pre>
<p>I've chosen each of the following parameters because they make sense for the <kbd>book</kbd> custom post type:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>description</kbd>: This one's pretty self-explanatory.</li>
<li><kbd>public</kbd>: This means that the post type is available publicly, just as posts and pages are<span>—</span>rather than being hidden behind the scenes. It'll get a user interface and can be shown in navigation menus, and so on.</li>
<li><kbd>rewrite</kbd>: This specifies that the post type can be used in the rewrite rules for pretty permalinks.</li>
<li><kbd>has_archive</kbd>: This enables post type archives (a classic index page, like we have for our standard posts).</li>
<li><kbd>supports</kbd>: This is an array of the capabilities that users see when they're creating or editing an item. For books, we're including six items.</li>
<li><kbd>show_in_rest</kbd>: This enables our new custom post type to work with the block editor introduced in WordPress 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final function call, <kbd>flush_rewrite_rules()</kbd>, will allow us to show a standard archive listing of the books later on (just like a standard post listing, but for our custom post type).</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">These are just some of the arguments you can pass. Read about the others in the codex at <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type">https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type</a>.</div>
<p>Now that we've got the basic post type set up, let's add some labels.</p>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding labels</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You can add labels to your custom post type so that WordPress knows what to say when talking about it. First, let's simply create an array of all the labels. Put this as the first thing inside the <kbd>book_init()</kbd> function, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre>$labels = array( 
  'name' =&gt; 'Books', 
  'singular_name' =&gt; 'Book', 
  'add_new' =&gt; 'Add New', 
  'add_new_item' =&gt; 'Add New Book', 
  'edit_item' =&gt; 'Edit Book', 
  'new_item' =&gt; 'New Book', 
  'view_item' =&gt; 'View Book', 
  'search_items' =&gt; 'Search Books', 
  'not_found' =&gt;  'No books found', 
  'not_found_in_trash' =&gt; 'No books found in Trash' 
);</pre>
<p>Then, add a single line of code to the <kbd>$args</kbd> array telling it to use the labels, as shown in the following snippet:</p>
<pre>$args = array( 
  'labels' =&gt; $labels, 
  'description' =&gt; 'A custom post type that holds my books', 
/* the rest of the function remains the same */</pre>
<p>The next step is to add messages, which is what WordPress tells the user when they are doing stuff with books.</p>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding messages</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Whenever a user updates, previews, or does anything with a book, you'll want them to see an accurate message. All we need to do is create an array of messages and then hook them to WordPress, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre>function book_updated_messages( $messages ) { 
  $messages['book'] = array( 
    '', /* Unused. Messages start at index 1. */  
    sprintf('Book updated. &lt;a href="%s"&gt;View book&lt;/a&gt;', 
    esc_url(get_permalink($post_ID))),  
    'Custom field updated.',  
    'Custom field deleted.',  
    'Book updated.',  
    (isset($_GET['revision']) ? 
    sprintf('Book restored to revision from %s', 
    wp_post_revision_title((int)$_GET['revision'], false)) : false), 
    print('Book published. &lt;a href="%s"&gt;View book&lt;/a&gt;', 
    esc_url(get_permalink($post_ID))),  
    'Book saved.',  
    sprintf('Book submitted. &lt;a target="_blank" href="%s"&gt;
    Preview book&lt;/a&gt;', 
    esc_url(add_query_arg('preview', 'true', 
    get_permalink($post_ID)))), 
    sprintf('Book scheduled for: &lt;strong&gt;%1$s&lt;/strong&gt;. 
    &lt;a target="_blank" 
    href="%2$s"&gt;Preview book&lt;/a&gt;', 
    date_i18n('M j, Y @ G:i', strtotime($post-
    &gt;post_date)), esc_url(get_permalink($post_ID))), 
    sprintf('Book draft updated. &lt;a target="_blank" href="%s"&gt;
    Preview book&lt;/a&gt;', 
    esc_url(add_query_arg('preview', 'true', get_permalink($post_ID))))
  ); 
  return $messages; 
} 
add_filter('post_updated_messages', 'book_updated_messages');</pre>
<p>This code creates a function named <kbd>book_updated_messages()</kbd>, which sets up an array of messages and returns it. We call this using the filter for <kbd>post_updated_messages</kbd>.</p>
<p>Now, our custom post type is ready to use! Go to your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> panel and reload it. You'll see that a new menu has appeared under <span class="packt_screen">Comments</span>. It's called <span class="packt_screen">Books</span>. Let's add a book, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/d28bfca8-77a9-4b72-a3e9-aa3e15eada00.png" width="1415" height="898"/></p>
<p>Note that I gave it a custom field named <kbd>book_author</kbd>, and I also uploaded a featured image for the book cover. Now, when you go to the main <span class="packt_screen">Books</span> page, you'll see the book listed. If you click on the <span class="packt_screen">View</span> link under the book's title, you'll see the book displayed using the <kbd>single.php</kbd> theme template, which won't be the most reader-friendly experience. Therefore, let's make some new template files to display our books.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating book template files</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>WordPress needs to know how to display your new post type. You have to create a template for a single book, and one for the listing of books. Perform the following steps to do this: </p>
<ol>
<li>First, we'll make a book version of <kbd>single.php</kbd>. It must be named <kbd>single-POST_TYPE_NAME.php</kbd>, which in our case is <kbd>single-book.php</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Using <kbd>page.php</kbd> as our starting point (as it's already the closest to what we'd like our book page to look like), we're going to add the display of the custom field, <kbd>book_author</kbd>, and the featured image.</li>
<li>So, let's start by taking our <kbd>page.php</kbd> file, making a copy of it, and renaming it <kbd>single-book.php</kbd>. Also, let's make a copy of <kbd>content-page.php</kbd> and call it <kbd>content-book.php</kbd>.</li>
<li>Next, it's time to include all the elements. Here's what the two files look like. First, <kbd>single-book.php</kbd> <span>looks like this:</span></li>
</ol>
<pre>&lt;?php 
/** 
 * The template for displaying a single book. 
 * 
 * @package Daily Cooking Custom 
 */ 
?&gt;&lt;?php get_header(); ?&gt; 
 
&lt;div id="primary" class="content-area"&gt; 
  &lt;main id="main" class="site-main" role="main"&gt; 
    &lt;?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?&gt; 

      &lt;?php get_template_part('content', 'book'); ?&gt; 

    &lt;?php endwhile; // end of the loop. ?&gt; 

  &lt;/main&gt;&lt;!-- #main --&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt; 

&lt;?php get_sidebar(); ?&gt; 
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The only change that's been made to this file is the <kbd>get_template_part()</kbd> function call.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Next, the <kbd>content-book.php</kbd> file looks like the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre>&lt;?php 
/** 
 * The template used for displaying book content 
 * 
 * @package Daily Cooking Custom 
 */ 
?&gt; 
 
&lt;article id="post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;" &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt;&gt; 
  &lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 
    &lt;?php the_title('&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;', '&lt;/h1&gt;'); ?&gt; 
  &lt;/header&gt; 

  &lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 
    &lt;?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?&gt; 
      &lt;div class="post-image alignleft"&gt;
      &lt;?php echo get_the_post_thumbnail($post-&gt;ID, 'medium', 
      array('style' =&gt; 'border: 1px solid black;')); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;?php endif; ?&gt; 
    &lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 

  &lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 
  &lt;/footer&gt; 
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;!-- #post-## --&gt;</pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now, let's take our custom field, <kbd>book_author</kbd>, and display it right below the featured image. We can do this by adding one new line of code in between the featured image code and the main content code, as shown in the following code snippet:</li>
</ol>
<pre>&lt;?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?&gt; 
  &lt;div class="post-image alignleft"&gt;
  &lt;?php echo get_the_post_thumbnail($post-&gt;ID, 'medium', 
  array('style' =&gt; 'border: 1px solid black;')); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt; 
&lt;?php echo '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by '.get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, 'book_author', true).
'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'; ?&gt; 
&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;</pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>At this point, when you visit a single book page, the author's name is displayed and the book cover shows up automatically, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7603568d-d5fa-4ba5-a2a1-8d8c8ddcb41d.png" width="1357" height="818"/></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Our next task is a page that will show a listing of the books, like what <kbd>index.php</kbd> does for the posts. By default, WordPress uses the <kbd>archive.php</kbd> file to show the listing of every new custom post type.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">We can customize this by creating a new template file and calling it <kbd>archive-book.php</kbd>. To be more exact, every template file controlling the archive for any new custom post type has to be named <kbd>archive-POST_TYPE.php</kbd>. The easiest way to create such file is by making a copy of the standard <kbd>archive.php</kbd> file or the <kbd>index.php</kbd> file, and renaming it to <kbd>archive-book.php</kbd>. Then, we can take it from there and modify the file to fit our requirements. So, what I'm going to do here is use my <kbd>index.php</kbd> as the template and do some tuning up around it.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Right now, my new <kbd>archive-book.php</kbd> file doesn't offer any custom way of displaying my books. What it looks like is shown in the following code:</li>
</ol>
<pre>&lt;?php 
/** 
 * The listing of books. 
 * 
 * @package Daily Cooking Custom

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Registering and using a custom taxonomy</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Just to follow the example given a while ago with our custom post type for books, let's now create a custom taxonomy. Why? You simply might not want to mix book categories and post categories, so we are going to create a custom taxonomy named <span class="packt_screen">Book Categories</span>. Add the following code to your <kbd>functions.php</kbd> file:</p>
<pre>function build_taxonomies() { 
  register_taxonomy( 
    'book_category', 
    'book', 
    array( 
      'hierarchical' =&gt; true, 
      'public' =&gt; true, 
      'show_in_rest' =&gt; true, 
      'label' =&gt; 'Book Category', 
      'query_var' =&gt; true, 
      'rewrite' =&gt; array('slug' =&gt; 'available-books') 
    ) 
  ); 
} 
add_action('init', 'build_taxonomies', 0);</pre>
<p>Like the <kbd>register_post_type()</kbd> function, the <kbd>register_taxonomy()</kbd> function allows you to register a new taxonomy within WordPress. You can read up on the details of all of the parameters you can add in the codex (<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy">https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy</a>). For now, you can see that we're calling it <kbd>book_category</kbd>; it belongs to the  <kbd>book</kbd> object type and is hierarchical, and you can query it, too. It needs to be included in the rewrite of URLs with a custom slug, <kbd>available-books</kbd>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to make this taxonomy available to books. Simply find the <kbd>$args</kbd> array we used while registering the book post type (the <kbd>book_init()</kbd> function) and add the <kbd>taxonomies</kbd> item to the array, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre>$args = array( 
  'labels' =&gt; $labels, 
  'description' =&gt; 'A custom post type that holds my books', 
  'public' =&gt; true, 
  'rewrite' =&gt; array('slug' =&gt; 'books'), 
  'has_archive' =&gt; true, 
  'taxonomies' =&gt; array('book_category'), 
  'supports' =&gt; array('title', 'editor', 'author', 'excerpt', 
  'custom-fields', 'thumbnail') 
);</pre>
<p>When you return to the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> panel and edit a book, you'll see that the book categories have appeared on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7fce5814-6677-4ce7-a737-694a7d027a28.png" style="width:27.75em;height:23.17em;" width="656" height="548"/></p>
<p>After you've added some categories and assigned them to the books, let's take a look at displaying those categories on the front of the website. First, we'll add them to the single book display. Open <kbd>content-book.php</kbd> and add the following code in at an appropriate place within the loop (for example, you can add it right after the <kbd>the_content()</kbd> function call):</p>
<pre>&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 
  &lt;?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?&gt; 
    &lt;div class="post-image alignleft"&gt;
    &lt;?php echo get_the_post_thumbnail($post-&gt;ID, 'medium', 
    array('style' =&gt; 'border: 1px solid black;')); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;?php endif; ?&gt; 
  &lt;?php echo '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by '.get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, 
  'book_author', true).
  '&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'; ?&gt; 
  &lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt; 
  &lt;?php echo get_the_term_list($post-&gt;ID, 'book_category', 
  '&lt;em&gt;Categories: ', ', ', '&lt;/em&gt;'); ?&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>You're using the <kbd>get_the_term_list()</kbd> function , which takes the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ID of the post (<kbd>$post-&gt;ID</kbd>)</li>
<li>The name of the taxonomy (<kbd>book_category</kbd>)</li>
<li>Print before the list (<kbd>&lt;em&gt;Categories:</kbd>)</li>
<li>Separate items in the list with (<kbd>,</kbd>)</li>
<li>Print after the list (<kbd>&lt;/em&gt;</kbd>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, now that you have categories, you can visit <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Menus</span> and add links to those categories to your header menu, and you can also create a custom menu with all the categories and add it to one of the sidebars.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you get a 404 error from WordPress at any point during the creation of your custom post type and custom taxonomy when you don't think you should, then navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Permalinks</span> and just save the changes without actually changing anything. Sometimes, WordPress needs to refresh the permalinks to make the new links work correctly.</div>

    </div>



  
<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Customizing the admin display</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The final thing you can do to fully realize your new book custom-post-type is to change its display in the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> panel. You don't need to know the WordPress user who created a given book, but you do want to see the book categories and the thumbnail. Let's go back to <kbd>functions.php</kbd>. First, we'll change the columns that are displayed, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre>function ahskk_custom_columns($defaults) { 
  global $wp_query, $pagenow; 
  if ($pagenow == 'edit.php') { 
    unset($defaults['author']); 
    unset($defaults['categories']); 
    unset($defaults['date']); 
    $defaults['book_category'] = 'Categories'; 
    $defaults['thumbnail'] = 'Image'; 
  } 
  return $defaults; 
} 
add_filter('manage_book_posts_columns', 'ahskk_custom_columns'); 
function ahskk_show_columns($name) { 
  global $post; 
  switch ($name) { 
    case 'book_category': 
      echo get_the_term_list($post-&gt;ID, 'book_category', '', ', ', ''); 
      break; 
    case 'thumbnail': 
      if (has_post_thumbnail($post-&gt;ID)) 
        echo get_the_post_thumbnail($post-&gt;ID, array('40', '40')); 
      break; 
  } 
} 
add_action('manage_book_posts_custom_column', 'ahskk_show_columns');</pre>
<p>The first function says, <em>don't show author, date, and categories, but do show book categories and thumbnail,</em> and the second function says, <em>for the book categories column, print the list of categories, and for the thumbnail column, print the <kbd>get_post_thumbnail()</kbd> function.</em></p>
<p>Revisit the <span class="packt_screen">Books</span> page in the <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> panel, and it now looks like the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7da7895b-6217-4eba-aac8-c444f5b79fcc.png" width="1447" height="695"/></p>

<p>This chapter was part two of our non-blog website journey with WordPress. I hope you enjoyed the material. We went through the whole process of setting up e-commerce sites, video blogs, photo blogs, and social networks. Along the way, we took a closer look at some interesting plugins and their functionalities, just to make your life easier as a WordPress developer. Finally, we created a custom post type and a corresponding custom taxonomy.</p>
<p>I believe that, at this point, you are well equipped to work with WordPress and use it to build your next great website! WordPress is a top-notch CMS (Content Management System) that has matured tremendously over the years. The WordPress admin panel is designed to be user-friendly and is continuously being improved. The code that underlies WordPress is robust, and is the creation of a large community of dedicated developers. Additionally, the functionality of WordPress can be extended through the use of plugins and themes.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed the information in this book and that you've already started working on your next (or perhaps first) WordPress website. Be sure to stay connected to the WordPress open source community! Thank you for reading; you rock!</p>
