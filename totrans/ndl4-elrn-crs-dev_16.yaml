    generating progress reports that help students as well as teachers. For example,
    there is a new activity completion indicator that tracks the student's progress
    on their assigned tasks in each course. Similarly, the Dashboard has an updated
    **Timeline** block and a highly functional **Calendar** block that bring all the
    course deadlines together on one page.

    reports that are useful for different constituencies within the organization,
    ranging from students, teachers, managers, and administrators.'

    of engagement are vital in assessing **satisfactory academic progress** (**SAP**)
    and Moodle offers several features that are of special interest. These focus on
    determining how well your students are progressing through a course. Reports and
    logs show you who has done what on your site, or in your course. They can be invaluable
    tools in letting you know how students are achieving learning goals, and they
    can serve as useful gap analyses that allow you to make adjustments to your content
    and assessment strategies.

    the term. First, you may need to report which students never attended so that
    you can drop them for non-attendance. Then, you may need to generate mid-term
    progress reports. Finally, you may need to provide metrics on students' time on
    task and completion rates. Moodle's logs and reports can help you.

- en: Please keep in mind that this book is meant as a general introduction and focuses
    on instructional strategies that help you plan your course structure, resources,
    and activities to maximize your chances of success. Moodle is a robust learning
    management system with a complex structure, amazing flexibility and customizability,
    and reporting. It's easy to get overwhelmed. But, there's no need to worry. It
    is very easy to set up a basic shell or functional template, and you can add features
    as you go. The key is to keep your learning objectives and course goals in mind,
    and then to map out how you plan to teach by developing a template or storyboard.
