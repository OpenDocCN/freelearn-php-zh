<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Introduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pre03"/>Introduction</h1></div></div></div><p>phpBB is a free, open-source Internet community application, with outstanding discussion forums and membership management. Written in the PHP scripting language, and making use of the popular MySQL database, phpBB is a standard among web-hosting companies throughout the world, and is one of the most widely used bulletin-board packages in the world. phpBB short-circuits the need for you to be a web development master in order to create and manage massive online communities.</p><p>This book takes you through setting up and running your own phpBB-powered online community. In easy to follow language and with clear instructions, you will learn how to install your own system, tackle basic forum administration tasks, and customize the forum. After that, you will learn advanced administration and customization techniques, followed by information for extending phpBB programmatically.</p><div class="section" title="What This Book Covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec01"/>What This Book Covers</h1></div></div></div><p>The book starts with an overview of phpBB and online communities.<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to phpBB">Chapter 1</a></em></span> also gives some background information to phpBB, and gives you an idea of what you can achieve with phpBB with some real-life examples of phpBB-powered communities.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Installing and Configuring phpBB">Chapter 2</a></em></span> walks you through a full installation of phpBB, including the necessary preparation work and post-installation tasks. It also looks at configuring the installation, and troubleshooting tips to get you started with your new forum and online community as quickly as possible.</p><p>After you are set up and running,<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A Quick Tour of phpBB">Chapter 3</a></em></span> dives straight into the phpBB environment, familiarizing you with the basics of configuring your site, creating forums and users, and introducing you to the basics of phpBB administration. In order to fully understand the different features and their administration, the chapter starts with a tour of phpBB from the user and administrator points of view.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Customizing Your Forum">Chapter 4</a></em></span> looks at some more ways to customize your forum’s appearance and features. Making these customizations is essential to giving your community a unique identity that makes it stand out among other online forums. The appearance of a forum is mainly controlled by phpBB’s styling system, which manages the colors, images, and visual layout of the forum. In this chapter, you will learn about the basics of a phpBB 2.0 style, adding and removing styles, fixing common style installation problems, customizing styles, and adding new features, including "modifications", to the forum.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Forum Administration">Chapter 5</a></em></span> completes your mastery of phpBB administration. You will learn about making your board multi-lingual, configuring avatars, managing smilies, forum, user, and group permissions, as well as the human side of forum administration—moderation, flamewars, and banning.</p><p>To give your forum a truly unique look, you will probably want to create your own template. Creating your own template can be a very interesting process, but can also be quite time consuming.<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Creating Your Own Template">Chapter 6</a></em></span> takes you through this process, from designing a new template to realizing that design to create a new look for a forum. Starting with a rough sketch on paper, we move through all the steps until we have a finished template.</p><p>As your community grows, you may find that you need to expand the capabilities of your forum. Eventually you may need a feature and find yourself unable to locate an existing modification for it! <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Creating a New MOD">Chapter 7</a></em></span> shows you how to create a new modification (also known as a hack) for yourself, to help you get that extra feature you are so missing. In this chapter, you will start off by learning what modifications are, and the skills and tools needed to create a modification. After that, we create a simple modification, and show you how to make the modification available to other phpBB users.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Programming phpBB">Chapter 8</a></em></span> rounds things off with a look at what you need to know in order to program new, custom phpBB features. The chapter starts with a simple phpBB script, before moving on to working with the phpBB database, using phpBB messages and multiple languages, working with the template engine and authenticating users. We build a new phpBB extension at the end of the chapter, consolidating your phpBB programming knowledge.</p><p>There are also four appendices, covering the phpBB file and directory structure, phpBB resources, permission cheatsheets, and a guide to the phpBB database structure.</p></div></div>
