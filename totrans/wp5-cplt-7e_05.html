<p>By now, you have the blog part of your website fully under control. However, you've probably noticed that WordPress offers you a lot more than simply posts, comments, tags, and categories.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will explore and learn to control all the other types of content that WordPress lets you use. You'll be able to create static pages that aren't a part of your ongoing blog, add various types of media to your posts, and create appealing image galleries to display photos and other images.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and managing your page</li>
<li>Navigating through your media library</li>
<li>Importing/exporting content</li>
</ul>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Pages</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>At first glance, pages look very similar to posts. Both pages and posts have a title and a content area in which we can write extended text, add images, and so on. However, pages are handled quite differently from posts. First of all, pages don't have categories or tags (pages don't need to be categorized, since on most websites, there are a lot fewer pages than posts). Moreover, posts belong to your blog and are meant to be a part of an ongoing, expanding publication revolving around specific topics. Posts are added regularly, whereas pages are more static and aren't generally expected to change that much.</p>
<p>In short, I would advise you to think of pages as pieces of static content, and posts as a series of articles that are published in a timely manner. In other words, pages are meant to hold content that is equally up to date, no matter when someone reads it. For instance, the things that people publish via WordPress pages are most commonly details pertaining to their company or business, team, and other related and evergreen details. Posts are often very time-sensitive and present advice/news that's important today/now. For most blogs, posts are the pillars of their content and make up more than 90 percent of the entire content catalog.</p>
<p>When you first install WordPress, one page is created for you automatically (along with the first post and the first comment). You can see that page by going to <kbd>http://YOURSITE.com/sample-page/</kbd>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>To add a new page, go to your <kbd>wp-admin</kbd> and navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>, or use the drop-down menu in the top menu by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">New</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">Page</span>. This will take you to the block-based editor. As you'll notice, this is the same editor that we used when working on blog posts. The block editor is very universal and WordPress uses it for both posts and pages.</p>
<p>The minimum you need to do to create a new page is type in a title and some content. Then, click on the blue <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button, just as you would for a post. Your new page will become available under its unique URL.</p>
<p>You'll recognize most of the sections in the settings sidebar of the block-based editor. They work the same for pages as they do for posts. Let's talk about the one section that's new—the one called <span class="packt_screen">Page Attributes</span>, consisting of elements such as <span class="packt_screen">Parent Page</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Order</span>:</p>

<p>WordPress allows you to structure your pages hierarchically. This way, you can organize everything into <em>main pages</em> and <em>subpages</em>, which is useful if you're going to have a bigger number of pages on your site. For example, if I were to write a blog along with three other authors, we would each have one page about us on the site, but those would be subpages of the main <em><span class="packt_screen">About</span></em> page. If I was adding one of these pages, I'd first create a new <em><span class="packt_screen">About</span></em> page (the main one), then create another page just for me, called <em>About Karol</em>, and finally choose that main <em><span class="packt_screen">About</span></em> page as the parent for the new page.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Order</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>By default, all pages you create will be presented in alphabetical order by page title. If you want them in some other order, you can specify this by entering numbers in the <span class="packt_screen">Order</span> box for each of your pages. Pages with lower numbers (for example, 0) will be listed before pages with higher numbers (for example, 5). You can easily test this by editing some of your pages and assigning various numbers to them.</p>
<p>That being said, to be honest, this isn't a very clear method of rearranging pages, especially if you want them displayed in a menu. You can do this much more easily by working with menus directly (as described in <a href="7ecd502d-b30d-40d9-8b58-623323b644e5.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Customizing Your Website Appearance/Design</em>). In the end, I would advise you not to trouble yourself with setting the <span class="packt_screen">Order</span> attribute at all.</p>

<p>To see a list of all the pages on your website in <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> from the main menu. You'll see something similar to what's shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/31c61555-cfc0-4a5e-827e-5b725d819c11.png" style="width:39.42em;height:25.00em;" width="1234" height="784"/></p>
<p>By now, this list format should begin to look familiar to you. You've got your list of pages, and in each row, there are a number of useful links allowing you to <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Quick Edit</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Trash</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">View</span> the page. You can click on an author's name to filter the list by that author. You can use the two links at the top, <span class="packt_screen">All</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Published</span>, to filter the pages by status (if you have pages saved as <span class="packt_screen">Drafts</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Pending Review</span>, then they will also appear here). There's also filtering by date, through the drop-down menu just above the list of pages. Additionally, you can check certain boxes and mass edit pages using the <span class="packt_screen">Bulk Actions</span> menu at the top and bottom of the list. Finally, you can search through your pages with the search box at the top.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a home page</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There's one page that's very special among all the other pages that you can create on your website. That is the <em>home page</em>, also called the <em>front page</em>. In simple terms, the home page is what the visitors see when they go to your main website address—usually something like <kbd>YOURSITE.com</kbd>.</p>
<p>By default, WordPress displays a list of your most recent blog posts on the home page—in reverse chronological order. While having your latest blog posts there is okay for some types of websites, it's not optimal for everyone. Usually, you're going to be better off exploring the possibility of setting up a completely customized home page and picking by hand what you want to have displayed on it.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Going forward, we're going to assume that you're using the default WordPress theme—<span class="packt_screen">Twenty Nineteen</span>. If you're on a different theme, parts of the process described in this section of the chapter might work differently.</div>

<p>The first thing we need to do may seem a bit counter-intuitive, but it'll all make sense in a minute. Let's start by creating two blank pages. You can do this in the normal manner; just go to <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title the first one <span class="packt_screen">HOME</span>, the save, and publish it. Don't add any other content there for now, just the title.</li>
<li>Title the second one <span class="packt_screen">BLOG</span>; also save and publish it.</li>
</ul>


            </article>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Enabling the custom home page</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>We need to instruct WordPress to start using those two pages when determining the contents of your home page.</p>
<p>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Reading</span>. Once there, switch the first setting on the page from &lt;<span class="packt_screen">Your latest posts</span> to <span class="packt_screen">A static page</span>. From the drop-downs, assign your new page <span class="packt_screen">Home</span> as the <span class="packt_screen">Homepage</span> and the page <span class="packt_screen">BLOG</span> as the <span class="packt_screen">Posts page</span>, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/79ab5425-d888-4b53-961f-74e772b98083.png" style="width:26.25em;height:11.42em;" width="618" height="269"/></p>
<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Save Changes</span>.</p>
<p>With that, one of your new pages—<span class="packt_screen">Home—</span>has become the home page for your entire website. However, currently, there's nothing much going on there since the page is blank.</p>
<p>The other page—<span class="packt_screen">BLOG—</span>has been tasked with listing your latest blog posts in reverse chronological order. In other words, the <span class="packt_screen">BLOG</span> page now does what was previously done by the out-of-the-box default home page. You can see the blog page if you go to <kbd>YOURSITE.com/blog</kbd>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>A blank home page is surely not what you want, so let's customize it a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Home</span> page to start editing it. Start by giving the page a title—something that you want your visitors to see first as they land on your website. I'm not going to be creative here and simply type in <kbd>Welcome to my website!</kbd>.</li>
<li>Next, add whatever copy you think should find its place on the home page. If it's a business site you're building, you should probably mention what your business does and how it can serve its customers. Again, I'm not going to be creative and simply add a couple of random sentences. Here's what I have so far:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ae9cfd27-3cc0-45d2-b29a-fd6f5a7fa032.png" style="width:24.75em;height:14.00em;" width="760" height="429"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the next step, let's present some of the most recent posts on the blog, just so that people can get an idea about the kind of content they can expect from you. To begin, you can type a simple line, inviting people to check out your latest posts.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>After that, let's add a new block that we haven't worked with yet. The block is called <span class="packt_screen">Latest Posts</span>, and you can find it in the <span class="packt_screen">Widgets</span> section. Refer to the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/27d43e1c-d6b1-4601-b80c-e63860d23e4d.png" style="width:25.75em;height:24.58em;" width="636" height="607"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>As soon as you add this block, it's going to be populated with your most recent blog posts. I'm going to customize that block slightly. First, I'll change the view from <em>list</em> to <em>grid</em> by clicking on the following button:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b2d8876e-da76-42e9-8098-410b4c641ff8.png" style="width:40.50em;height:12.83em;" width="969" height="307"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Next, I'll adjust a couple of other settings via the settings sidebar, like so:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/64aff5c7-eb08-4293-a22f-a71a104c056f.png" style="width:17.25em;height:33.00em;" width="412" height="788"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">The things I've changed are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Columns: Set to 2</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Number of items: Set to 2</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px">Display post date: Set to yes</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, these settings are quite straightforward, so you can adjust them however you see fit for your specific website.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When I click on the <span class="packt_screen">Preview</span> button at this moment, I'll see two of my latest posts set side by side right there on the page:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/66d4c8aa-bad8-4b27-b2a1-a0e0534577f9.png" style="width:27.25em;height:15.25em;" width="878" height="492"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Lastly, let's set a featured image for the home page. This image will be displayed in the header section of the entire website, so it's best to pick something representative that you're going to be proud to see there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Assigning the featured image works just the same as it does for blog posts.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>From the settings sidebar, switch to the <span class="packt_screen">Document</span> tab and scroll down to the section labeled <span class="packt_screen">Featured Image</span>. Pick the image that you want to have set, and save the settings. When done, you'll see your image assigned:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3406fd37-f0f6-4b6e-8384-fe1fcb53a4ca.png" style="width:13.42em;height:26.17em;" width="406" height="791"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">At this stage, we're done working on our custom home page. Of course, there's a lot more that can be included on the home page, and it all depends on what you want your home page to represent. That's the whole magic of WordPress<span>—</span>you don't have to settle for what's already there but instead make the website truly yours.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>To see your current home page in all its glory, just navigate to your main website address. Here's what's on my home page:</li>
</ol>

            <article>
                
<p>The media library is where WordPress stores all of your uploaded files, such as images, PDFs, music, and videos. To see your media library, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Media</span> in the main menu (there's probably not a lot of media there at the moment):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9df91c8c-831e-49c6-92e0-cff4de66eb2e.png" style="width:47.83em;height:20.50em;" width="1344" height="575"/></p>
<p>What you're seeing is a nice grid layout that makes looking through media very user-friendly. My media library has four photos in it at the moment. Once I click on any of them, I will see the <span class="packt_screen">Attachment Details</span> screen that we talked about in <a href="3fe4e58d-07b0-48fb-a241-25001821a35d.xhtml">Chapter 3</a><em>, Creating Blog Content</em>. On this screen, there are a lot of options to modify the file that's been selected.</p>
<p>We can edit details, such as <span class="packt_screen">Title</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Caption</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Alt Text</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Description</span>, and also delete the file permanently or view it on the frontend of the site:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9c36fb5f-2a1a-48ef-918e-068045b3014e.png" width="1817" height="855"/></p>
<p>You can also add a new file to the media library. Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Media</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span> to access a page, similar to the upload media page that you got while uploading a file for a post. When you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Select Files</span> button and pick the file to be uploaded, or drag and drop it directly from your desktop, WordPress will upload the file and then display it along with the other media files in the library. Your new item will be unattached to any post or page at this point.</p>
<p>To include it somewhere (in a post or page), go to <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> and proceed to edit one of the posts/pages. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> button in the top-left corner and pick the <span class="packt_screen">Image</span> block. Now, instead of uploading a new file, just select it from the media library. We covered the entire process more extensively in the previous chapter:</p>

<p>WordPress not only allows you to add individual images to your posts and pages, but also allows you to create great-looking galleries comprised of multiple images. Here are the steps for creating a new image gallery and have it displayed inside a post or page.</p>

<p>You can add a gallery (or multiple galleries) to any new or existing page or post. I, for example, went with one of my existing posts, which you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/d1e7054f-2167-4824-a35c-9fdb823c91ce.png" style="width:21.92em;height:5.58em;" width="754" height="192"/></p>
<p>The first step to add a gallery to this post is to click the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> button in the top-left corner of the page and pick the <span class="packt_screen">Gallery</span> block:</p>

<p>This new <span class="packt_screen">Gallery</span> block looks very similar to the standard <span class="packt_screen">Image</span> block, and it gives you a couple of main options:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/15a4f5e5-2d7f-4187-a28d-ee3fff95626a.png" style="width:27.58em;height:14.25em;" width="604" height="312"/></p>
<p>Additionally, aside from the possibility of uploading images or picking them from the media library, you can drag and drop multiple images straight from your desktop. WordPress will immediately start turning them into a gallery. For this example, if you want to pick the images from the media library, just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Media Library</span> button. You'll see a panel that should be familiar at this point. In there, just click on the images that you want to have included in the gallery. As an example, I've selected three images (see the checkboxes in the upper-right corners):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/64046a4e-9ca8-4b59-9f05-d0f4062499e7.png" style="width:43.75em;height:23.75em;" width="1575" height="854"/></p>
<p>At this stage, you can adjust the titles and descriptions of the images if you want to, and then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Create a new gallery</span> button. In the next step, you have the opportunity to rearrange your images by dragging them around the display area. You can also adjust the captions (the captions will be saved so that they can be reused later on if you're creating a gallery using the same images). When you're done, just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Insert gallery</span> button:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3b3bf83a-a4c0-414a-b4cf-216b9177c497.png" width="1596" height="846"/></p>
<p>You'll see a nice preview of the gallery right on the canvas of your post. By clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Gallery</span> block, you'll also see some additional options. For instance, you can change the number of columns in the gallery, set if you want the images to be linked to anywhere, and crop them to fit the space available in the block. You can also upload additional images and add them to the gallery. You can see these options in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c8c5be93-883b-4ca1-b3f6-784d5bc46e17.png" width="1318" height="640"/></p>
<p>For example, if you decide to change the number of columns to 2, WordPress will do whatever it can to still make your gallery look great. Here's what happens to my gallery when I do this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c10eb748-30b8-46c1-8c59-8a804cabf828.png" style="width:29.83em;height:39.75em;" width="976" height="1300"/></p>
<p>As you can see, WordPress makes each picture fit perfectly on the page although, the degree of this perfection depends on the theme you're using.</p>

<p>The final thing we're going to discuss in this chapter is the feature of importing and exporting your content. By default, WordPress allows you to <em>take</em> content from other places and publish it on your site. Though, keep in mind that this doesn't happen automatically. WordPress will only help you import the content so that then you can decide what to do with it next.</p>
<p>There are a number of platforms supported, including <span class="packt_screen">Blogger</span>, <span class="packt_screen">LiveJournal</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Tumblr</span> blogs, and more. You can see the complete list by navigating to <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Import</span> (it's also the starting point when importing content):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/62c440d1-ee5d-4b35-9bd0-42fe8427486b.png" style="width:44.75em;height:39.08em;" width="1539" height="1343"/></p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Importing content</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you want to import content from any source, you first need to click on either of the <span class="packt_screen">Install Now</span> links that are under the available platforms (visible in the preceding screenshot). WordPress uses additional plugins to handle the importing, and it first needs to install them to carry out the procedure.</p>
<p>Importing content from each of the available platforms is a bit different, but the general process looks similar, so we're going to use another WordPress site as an example here—that is, we're going to import content from another WordPress website. For that to work, all we need to do is click on the <span class="packt_screen">Install Now</span> link that's within the <span class="packt_screen">WordPress</span> section (it's the last one in the preceding screenshot), and then, when the installation completes, click on the new <span class="packt_screen">Run Importer</span> link that will have just appeared. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b1c27ace-9803-445c-b2f7-8ad30fc319c1.png" style="width:45.42em;height:3.33em;" width="1218" height="90"/></p>
<p>This will take you straight to the importer panel:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/224f1ff9-893a-4b47-a65e-96956cc61c1b.png" style="width:32.50em;height:17.42em;" width="484" height="259"/></p>
<p>It is a very simple interface where all you have to do is take a WordPress export file and upload it to your site. The platform will take care of extracting the archive and importing the content into it. As a result, your site is going to be filled with new posts, pages, custom fields, navigation menus, and <span>even comments</span>.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this feature is to help everyone who's migrating their sites from platforms such as <span class="packt_screen">Blogger</span> or <span class="packt_screen">LiveJournal</span>. Imagine if someone had a Blogger blog with over a hundred posts in it. Going through each one individually and inputting it in to WordPress by hand would be too time-consuming. With this feature, it can be done in under a minute.</p>

<p>Exporting content is even simpler than importing. To begin, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Export</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/57709495-7481-47ae-817f-e26b95c5ce72.png" style="width:40.92em;height:20.42em;" width="1555" height="776"/></p>
<p>There's not much you can do here except select what you want to export and then click on the big button to download your WordPress export file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting <span class="packt_screen">All content</span> will export your posts, pages, comments, custom fields, terms, navigation menus, and custom posts</li>
<li>Selecting just <span class="packt_screen">Posts,</span> <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> or <span><span class="packt_screen">Media</span></span> is pretty self-explanatory</li>
</ul>
<p>When you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Download Export File</span> button, you will end up with a file that's just like the one we used when importing. This means that you can take that file and create a mirror copy of your site somewhere else on another domain name.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we explored the content that WordPress can handle that's not directly about blogging. You learned about static pages, the home page, the media library, image galleries, and importing/exporting content.</p>
<p>You are now fully equipped to use the WordPress <span class="packt_screen">Admin</span> panel to control all of your website's content. Next, you'll learn how to expand your site's functionality by installing new plugins, which we'll be discussing in the following chapter.</p>
