<p>Various terms are used to pigeon-hole Drupal: platform, framework, environment, and so on. At its core, Drupal is a content management system (CMS). Like the other terms, the meaning of CMS can be somewhat abstract and ambiguous, so here is what I feel the terms mean within the context of this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content</strong>: Digital material meant for sharing online</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>: Manipulation for the sake of usability, continuity and viability, including creating, editing, storing, retrieving, indexing, searching, reviewing, moderating, and translating</li>
<li><strong>System</strong>: A cohesive collection of functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>Put the three together, and you have Drupal at its heart: a <em>primarily used to make digital material available to users of the World Wide Web.</em></p>
<p>Drupal offers a breadth and depth of capabilities, with a strong baseline functionality that's greatly expandable via a high degree of customization. There is a cost associated with this, and with any product that offers broad personalization, and that is a learning curve that is not insignificant. Think about your first interactions with a car's display console, a smart watch, or even the New York subway system, and you will likely recall an initial paralysis when deciding the first thing to do; for some, there is nothing intuitive in the experience.</p>
<p>My hope, and the goal of this book, is to ease your way into Drupal, demystifying the manner in which to accomplish the more common content management activities.</p>
