- en: A foundational part of any assessment strategy in an online course often relies
    heavily on different types of automatically scoring quizzes. However, quizzes
    can often be the Achilles heel of a course or educational program if they are
    not designed well, and do not tie in well with overall course learning objectives.
    Planning with storyboarding is critical. Furthermore, in an environment where
    there is a need for "live" (synchronous) lectures via Zoom, Teams, BigBlueButton,
    or other platforms, quizzes are often overlooked. Nevertheless, they can be an
    ideal way to take stock of how and where the students are concerning learning
    goals, and to keep them engaged.

  zh: 在在线课程中，任何评估策略的基础部分通常严重依赖于不同类型的自动评分测验。然而，如果设计不当，并且与整体课程学习目标结合不佳，测验往往是一个课程或教育项目的致命弱点。使用故事板进行规划至关重要。此外，在需要通过Zoom、Teams、BigBlueButton或其他平台进行“实时”（同步）讲座的环境中，测验往往被忽视。尽管如此，它们可以是一个理想的方式来评估学生在学习目标方面的进展和位置，并保持他们的参与度。
- en: A well-designed use of quizzes can help learners achieve learning objectives,
    and they also satisfy **Universal Design for Learning** (**UDL**) guidelines that
    have to do with building a structure for student success. Quizzes can help with
    goal setting, self-regulation, and developing a positive "I can do it!", believe-in-yourself
    attitude (self-efficacy).

  zh: 设计良好的测验使用可以帮助学习者实现学习目标，并且它们也符合与构建学生成功结构的**通用学习设计**（**UDL**）指南。测验可以帮助设定目标、自我调节，以及培养积极的“我能做到！”和自信的态度（自我效能感）。
- en: Moodle 4.0's redesigned look and feel, as well as its responsive themes, make
    it easy to use on many different devices, including smartphones. This fact is
    critical because many learners will be relying on their phones to do coursework,
    particularly in situations where they cannot access the Moodle course on a laptop
    or desktop. In situations where learners are relying on cell phones, it's important
    to use assessment strategies that can display well on small screens. In that case,
    Moodle's Quiz activity is ideal, particularly for multiple-choice quizzes.

    SEB is a web browser environment that allows you to carry out e-assessments in
    a secure manner. The software turns any computer into a secure workstation and
    controls access to resources such as system functions, websites, and applications
    so that they cannot be used during an exam. Not every institution uses this approach
    since it is easily circumvented, both by smartphones and written notes and printed
    publications. You can configure SEB manually, or you can upload your own configuration.
    An exam configuration, as the name implies, is done for an exam and contains most
    of the known configuration attributes from the latest SEB configuration tool.
    It is outside the scope of this book to go into system administrator configurations
    in detail. If your institution uses SEB, obtain the configuration from your system
    administrator:'

    proctoring platform such as Meazure Learning (formerly ProctorU – [https://www.meazurelearning.com/](https://www.meazurelearning.com/)).
    You will need a subscription to their service, and all the students will need
    a built-in camera and microphone. Once you've subscribed, you can create a link
    so that they can log into the platform from within their course in Moodle.

    response, multiple choice" question. In such a question, you can ask learners
    to "select all that apply" and to receive credit, they must select all the correct
    answers. The advantages are that you will allow for several correct answers, there
    is less opportunity for guessing, and it avoids the "all of the above" option.
    The downside is that it requires 5 or 6 options, and it is more difficult to construct
    because it contains more distractors.

    of assessments, which we refer to as "competency frameworks." They are vital for
    establishing specific types of learning outcomes, particularly when they relate
    to a specific type of skill or job-related competency.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moodle allows you to tie to competency frameworks, which are external performance
    standards. For example, if your organization has an overall rubric that lists
    types of competencies, you may classify your questions so that they align with
    the competency categories. Then, when the student correctly performs the tasks
    in the quiz, a positive score is received, and a box is checked in the competency
    framework.
  id: totrans-349

    automatically updated for the student. However, it is easier to simply code the

    which can also relate to mastery learning. Because mastery learning is often tied
    to completing quizzes, it often follows that to earn a badge, the student will
    need to successfully complete quizzes. An **Open Badge** is a verifiable, portable
    digital badge with embedded metadata about skills and achievements. It complies
    with the Open Badges standard and can be shared via social media across the web.
    Each Open Badge is associated with an image and information about the badge, the
    organization that issued it, the subject matter, and other key evidence (number
    and so on).
