- en: A foundational part of any assessment strategy in an online course often relies
    heavily on different types of automatically scoring quizzes. However, quizzes
    can often be the Achilles heel of a course or educational program if they are
    not designed well, and do not tie in well with overall course learning objectives.
    Planning with storyboarding is critical. Furthermore, in an environment where
    there is a need for "live" (synchronous) lectures via Zoom, Teams, BigBlueButton,
    or other platforms, quizzes are often overlooked. Nevertheless, they can be an
    ideal way to take stock of how and where the students are concerning learning
    goals, and to keep them engaged.

    and they also satisfy **Universal Design for Learning** (**UDL**) guidelines that
    have to do with building a structure for student success. Quizzes can help with

    it easy to use on many different devices, including smartphones. This fact is
    critical because many learners will be relying on their phones to do coursework,
    particularly in situations where they cannot access the Moodle course on a laptop
    or desktop. In situations where learners are relying on cell phones, it's important
    to use assessment strategies that can display well on small screens. In that case,

    If they get it wrong again, the system subtracts another 50 percent from the score.

    answers. The advantages are that you will allow for several correct answers, there

    standards. For example, if your organization has an overall rubric that lists
    types of competencies, you may classify your questions so that they align with
    the competency categories. Then, when the student correctly performs the tasks
    in the quiz, a positive score is received, and a box is checked in the competency
    framework.

    digital badge with embedded metadata about skills and achievements. It complies
    with the Open Badges standard and can be shared via social media across the web.
