- en: This book aims to teach you how to develop web applications efficiently with
    the Ellis Labs CodeIgniter platform. The CodeIgniter platform is an object-oriented
    Model-View-Controller development platform. For more on MVC, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller).
    The reader of this book is expected to be familiar with at least the PHP programming
    language, specifically with PHP OOP (object-oriented programming) and its usage,
    as well as with MySQL.

- en: CodeIgniter (referred to as CI in this book) is an Application Development Framework,
    a toolkit for people who build websites and web applications using PHP. CodeIgniter
    is a smart application development skeleton framework, with flexible and expandable
    core powered high performance and low footprint. The CodeIgniter framework (OSL
    3.0 open source license), developed and maintained by Ellis Labs, powers an echo
    system of developers across the globe. The first public version of CodeIgniter
    was released on February 28, 2006\. It got very good feedback from web application
    professional developers. During November 2010, the CodeIgniter development project
    was added to the well-known GitHub community projects, and got increasing interest
    and usage by developers worldwide, as well as more and more third parties providing
    more add-ons with a better maturity and functionality set.

- en: There is a rising trend of web applications based on **OOP** (**object-oriented
    programming**) frameworks using **MVC** (**Model-View-Controller**) development
    patterns, described in the next section, for developing advanced web applications.
    CodeIgniter is such a framework. It seems that CodeIgniter is continuously increasing
    its popularity as it has a simple yet high quality OOP core that enables great
    creativity, reusability, and code clarity naming conventions, which are easy to
    expand (user class extends CI class), while more third-party application plugins
    (including views/controllers/models/libraries/helpers providing application-oriented
    solutions such as CMS, shopping carts, or table grid navigators) and add-ons of
    libraries/helpers are becoming available.

- en: The MVC concept is a development pattern or an application framework for a computer
    user interface that separates the representation of information from the user
    interacting with it. MVC has been adopted as a successful architecture for web
    application developments. The model consists of application data and provides
    services to manipulate them. The controller handles business rules and executes
    requests to the models and views. The controller mediates between the input, mostly
    received from a user interacting with a web browser that executed the rendered
    view. The browser runs a received rendered view by the controller through an HTTP
    protocol. The controller is the heart of the application. It performs model/database
    updates, business logic calculations, renders views to the user, and responds
    to an asynchronous **AJAX** (**Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**) request sent
    from the client side. The view code defines the presentation and user input logic
    to be rendered by the controller as HTML and JavaScript to the browser. The browser
    receives the rendered view via the HTTP response to be executed locally. The browser
    executing that content can present data, such as a mix of text, charts, diagrams,
    and images.

- en: There are legacy **CMS** (**Content Management System**) web development platforms
    focused on CMS functionality and maintenance, such as a mature platform named
    DRUPAL. It might be very useful for content-oriented projects, but less appealing
    if the project aims to develop a new rich set of functionality, that is, web apps
    with many inputs and customized UI operations. If the project's requirements involve
    a low footprint and fast response/high performance, CodeIgniter is found to have
    excellent results.

- en: To sum up in terms of flexibility, code reusability, light infrastructure, enabling
    developer creativity, code clarity, highest performance, minimal footprint, and
    fast learning curve, CodeIgniter seems to be the best choice. Furthermore, it
    is part of a proactive improvement process thanks to the growing developer's community
    worldwide.
