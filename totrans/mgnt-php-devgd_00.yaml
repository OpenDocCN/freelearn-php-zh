- en: This book will help new and not-so-new developers understand and work with the
    Magento fundamental concepts and standard practices in order to develop and test
    Magento code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is my attempt at writing a book that answers questions that many developers,
    including myself, had when we started to develop for Magento, for example, what
    is EAV? How does the ORM in Magento work? What are observers and events? What
    were the design patterns used to create Magento?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More importantly, it will also answer questions that many developers still have,
    for example, what is the standard to develop modules and extend the frontend and
    backend? How can I properly test my code? What is the best method to deploy and
    distribute custom modules?
