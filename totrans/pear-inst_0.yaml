- en: Chances are, you've seen the acronym **PEAR** at some point in your use of PHP,
    whether it was in passing or when installing and using a package from `pear.php.net`.
    If you've investigated, you've probably heard of popular software provided by
    PEAR, such as the DB database abstraction package, or the HTML_QuickForm package.
    What you may not realize is that PEAR is much more than just a collection of packages
    that you can use. PEAR also contains the most versatile installation program for
    PHP, the PEAR installer.

- en: With the PEAR installer, you can do much more than just install packages from
    `pear.php.net`. You can install packages from other PEAR channels, distribute
    your own software projects using your own PEAR channel, and even maintain a complex
    web project, all using the PEAR installer. Surprised? Well read on, as this book
    reveals the intimate secrets of the PEAR installer and how it will revolutionize
    your everyday development with the PHP programming language!

- en: '*[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Acquiring PEAR: What is it and How do I
    Get It?")* introduces you to the PEAR installer. We begin with a look at the traditional
    unzip-and-go method of distributing PHP software and compare its advantages and
    disadvantages to the PEAR installer''s package-based method of distributing PHP
    software. You will see the innovation of PEAR channels, take a peek inside how
    the PEAR installer installs files from packages, and learn how it knows where
    to install them. Finally, you will see the many ways to acquire the PEAR installer
    and even how to install PEAR remotely onto a web host that does not provide shell
    access.'

- en: '*[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Mastering PHP Software Management with the
    PEAR Installer")* is a must-read for all PHP developers, as it explains the basic
    workings of `package.xml`, the heart of the PEAR installer. `package.xml` is used
    to control almost everything the PEAR installer can do. You will learn about the
    importance of versioning in controlling the quality of packages installed, the
    importance of dependencies, and how the PEAR installer manages this important
    link between libraries and applications. You will also learn how `package.xml`
    organizes package metadata such as the package name, authors, release notes, and
    changelog, and has critical installation data such as files, dependencies, and
    versioning organized.'

    the PEAR Installer")* goes further in depth for developers who want to take advantage
    of the full application-support features introduced in `package.xml` version 2.0.'

    Installer")* takes a break from looking at the details of the PEAR installer,
    and dives into using the PEAR installer to develop and to maintain a complicated
    and rapidly evolving website.'

- en: '*[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Releasing to the World: PEAR Channels")*
    covers PEAR channels. Channels are designed to make it easy to install packages
    from any location, but difficult to compromise your system in the process, following
    a basic security principle: always design things so that the easiest way to do
    them is the most secure.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Channels open up `pear.php.net's` monopoly over the PEAR installer to the entire
    Internet. Custom-built packages distributed through your channel can even be sold
    and made available to specific users while co-existing peacefully with publicly
    available open-source packages.

- en: '*[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Embedding the PEAR Installer: Designing
    a Custom Plug-In System")* teaches you how to embed the PEAR installer to create
    a plug-in manager. The chapter creates a fake blog application that provides the
    ability to seamlessly query a remote PEAR channel server designed to distribute
    templates. Using the internal classes of the PEAR installer, our blog web application
    intelligently installs and upgrades templates with all of the sophistication expected
    from the PEAR installer.'
