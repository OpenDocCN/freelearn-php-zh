- en: Nowadays, we usually learn new material using the various information found
    on forums and blogs, and we rely on the information we come across. Depending
    on the time spent on those articles, you will often skip some fundamental concepts,
    leaving even experienced programmers surprised when we discover some new and easier
    way to do something. This book covers the basic knowledge of Liquid and some advanced
    concepts that will set you on a proper path toward adding Liquid to your portfolio.

- en: Liquid is an open source project created by Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobias
    Lütke. As a template language, Liquid variables connect the Shopify store's data
    to the static HTML content in our theme, allowing us to turn a static template
    into a fully dynamic and powerful e-commerce store, producing impressive results.
    Since 2006, Liquid has been growing and evolving. Today, many different web applications
    rely on Liquid, Shopify being one of those, which shows that the need for Liquid
    is ever-growing.

- en: We can divide the book into three major sections. In the first section, we will
    get familiar with some basic information about Shopify, understand the Shopify
    interface and its theme structure, and start familiarizing ourselves with Liquid.
    Even though these topics might not sound that important, they will allow us to
    understand Shopify and Liquid at the foundational level. By understanding these
    basics, we will learn how to face problems in these areas, which are inevitable
    and frequent.

- en: The second section of the book we will dedicate entirely to Liquid's core features,
    without which we will not be able to create many wonderfully complex components.
    While we will not go over every object, tag, and filter that exists, we learn
    about the essence of Liquid core and draw attention to some commonly used development
    techniques.

- en: The third and final section of the book will take us behind the scenes, where
    we will learn how to use JSON to create easily configurable options that are the
    soul of a Shopify e-commerce store. Finally, we will learn how to use the Shopify
    Ajax API combined with the Liquid features covered previously to create powerful
    features and make our code more dynamic.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for beginners and experienced CMS developers who want to learn
    about working with Shopify themes and customizing those themes using Liquid. Web
    developers working on designing professional e-commerce websites would also find
    this book useful. Besides familiarity with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS,
    and JavaScript), this book requires no prior knowledge of Shopify or Liquid. The
    book covers everything from Shopify fundamentals, the core of Liquid, and the
    REST API, all the way to the latest Liquid features that may be new even to proficient
    developers.

- en: '[*"Share Your Thoughts" on page* *xvi*](B17606_Preface_Final_PD_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013),
    *Getting Started with Shopify*, creates a solid foundation for understanding what
    Shopify is, how it all works, and other essential knowledge that, as practice
    shows, is often skipped. The approach of cutting the theoretical and jumping straight
    into the syntax might sound tempting, but as we all know, even the tiniest ripples
    can cause considerable problems in the future. While we will not go much into
    how Toby Lütke created Shopify, we will cover some essential topics, including
    creating a private development store, creating a child theme, explaining theme
    structure, and other essential topics that we need to know.'

    of Liquid*, helps us learn what Liquid is and how to write it by explaining the
    Liquid syntax. We will also go over logical and comparison operators, what types
    of data we can use within Liquid, what handles are, and other essentials. By learning
    how to use logical operators and manipulate handle attributes, we will also learn
    how to combine them to create various dynamic features.'

    Liquid Core with Tags*, covers programming logic, or in short, tags. There are
    many types of tags, such as control flow tags, which allow us to output a block
    of Liquid code based on various conditionals through iteration tags that will
    repeatedly run a block of code. Additionally, we will learn about the different
    types of variable tags we can use to store data, as well as theme tags that will
    allow us to render theme-specific tags.'

    Liquid Core with Objects*, helps us understand what content objects are, why they
    are mandatory, and how to use them, which is the first step in creating future
    templates. After that, we will move to global objects, the knowledge of which
    will open a new door for us and output our dynamic content on any page. Lastly,
    we will learn what metafield objects are and utilize them to output unique content
    on any page.'

    Liquid Core with Filters*, is a crucial topic of Liquid core, which will allow
    us to create or manipulate different types of data, which is a compelling feature.
    With Liquid filters, we will gain a more profound knowledge of how Liquid works
    and how easily we can output dynamic data such as the image HTML tag, calculating
    the product discount, and handling font variants.'

    by learning what types of settings we can use inside our JSON files and the difference

    We will learn how to create static and dynamic sections and their counterpart
    blocks, which play a considerable role in theme development. Lastly, we will learn
    more about the newly introduced JSON-type templates and how we can combine them
    with metafields to create genuinely unique and easily configurable content on

    types of requests to the Shopify API. We will learn how to retrieve product information,
    add any number of products to the cart session, and read the cart''s current content.
    Lastly, we will learn how to make a request through the Shopify API and retrieve
    the necessary information to create the product recommendation and predictive

    already be familiar with basic HTML markup, CSS, and understand the JavaScript
