            <article>
                
<p>The topic of website security can be an intimidating one. On the one hand, we all want our websites to be secure, but, on the other, we fear that we might not have the skills to battle hackers trying to break into our sites. But hold off on that thought for a second; why would anyone even attack your site in the first place?! You're not a financial institution or a popular online publication, so why would anyone care to spend their time trying to harm your site?</p>
<p>Well, the reality can be harsh in this case. Most hacker attacks are not about stealing your revenue or taking over your site as a whole. Usually, they are about including a small piece of code on your site that links out to other external sites (most of the time, either fraudulent sites or <em>naughty</em> content). What does the hacker get out of it? This varies, but usually, those kinds of attacks are done to use your site as part of a network that is meant to achieve a specific goal. Effectively, your site becomes a zombie—it does whatever the hacker tells it to do, and it's part of a bigger network of similar <em>zombie sites</em>.</p>
<p>So how can we prevent this <em>zombification</em> of your site from happening? That's what this chapter is about. Let's start with the basics.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principles of WordPress security</li>
<li>The best practices for WordPress security</li>
<li>Installing an SSL</li>
<li>Security plugins and which ones to get</li>
<li>Setting up secure user accounts</li>
<li>User roles and abilities</li>
<li>Managing users</li>
<li>User management plugins</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we get into any specific tips and techniques for WordPress security, let's set some groundwork in place. Your number one objective is to set the most fundamental elements in place so that you can avoid 99% of the attacks. Remember that the hackers are not targeting your site individually. Instead, they target a whole cluster of sites and aim to take advantage of known vulnerabilities. Therefore, if you erase that given vulnerability from your site, then you're effectively preventing the attack from happening.</p>
<p>Again, our number one goal: prevention through implementing best practices. Or, to say it another way, let's do the 20% of the work that'll give us 80% of the result. To achieve that, let's start with some overall best practices for website security.</p>

<p>The good thing about the most essential best practices for your WordPress website security is that they are all very simple to implement. Let's start with the basics.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This sounds really simple, but the value of a strong password cannot be overstated. Many hacker attacks try to capitalize on the user having a simple password that's either a dictionary word or is one of the most commonly used passwords. In other words, if you can see your WordPress password on the following list, then you're doing it wrong:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>123456</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>12345678</li>
<li>qwerty</li>
<li>12345</li>
<li>123456789</li>
<li>letmein</li>
<li>1234567</li>
<li>football</li>
<li>iloveyou</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>admin</li>
<li>welcome</li>
<li>monkey</li>
<li>login</li>
<li>abc123</li>
<li>starwars</li>
<li>123123</li>
<li>dragon</li>
<li>password</li>
<li>master</li>
<li>hello</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>For a more complete list of the most commonly used passwords, visit this page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords</a>.</p>
<p>So, how do you set a strong password? There are two schools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either use a selection of random characters with lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols (like hyphens); for example: <kbd>noUYhf56%%6fJJJ-Njh</kbd></li>
<li>Come up with an actual sentence, and then join it together into a password using hyphens; for example: <kbd>I-like-pizza-but-cake-is-good-too</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>To change your password, go to <span class="packt_screen">Users</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Your Profile</span>. Once there, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Generate Password</span> button (refer to the following screenshot). WordPress will suggest a password, but you can also input your own. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Update Profile</span> when done:</p>

<p>With every new release of the WordPress software, you get a range of improvements and upgrades. Some of those are entirely new features, some are improvements to old features, and some are improvements in the realm of security. For that reason, keeping your WordPress up to date is the best way to stay out of trouble and make sure that your WordPress website remains in tune with the current developments in website security.</p>
<p>Whenever a new version of WordPress is available, you'll see an update prompt in <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>. Please make sure to pay attention to those prompts. It really can't be emphasized enough how important they are.</p>

<p>Staying with the idea of updates, just like the WordPress core gets updated, themes and plugins get updated as well. You should install them as soon as they're available for the very same reason you want to be installing WordPress updates.</p>
<p>To see what updates are available for your site in general, go to <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Updates</span>. You'll see a summary there, along with links enabling you to get the updates installed, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are thousands of WordPress plugins available on the web. As exciting as some of them might appear, you should think twice before installing some of the less popular plugins, or plugins that haven't been tested by users.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, first of all, you shouldn't install anything that's not essential for your website to do its job efficiently. If a plugin is just a cool thing to have, but not essential, you should probably skip it.</p>
<p>Over and above that, also pay attention to the ratings, compatibility info, and the popularity numbers of the plugin that you're considering. For example, here are some relevant fields from the Jetpack plugin's official page at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/23b09ce7-ec77-4d14-af55-8be455646e73.png" width="1156" height="647"/></p>
<p>When installing a new plugin, try not getting anything with low ratings, a small number of installs, or a plugin that hasn't been tested with the current versions of WordPress.</p>
<p>That's it in terms of the topic of WordPress security best practices. Now, let's get down to some additional work.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing an SSL</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>S</strong><strong>ecure sockets layer</strong> (<strong>SSL</strong>) is a web technology that was created to encrypt the connection between a web server (a website) and the client's browser (the person reading the website).</p>
<p>With an encrypted connection, it's basically impossible to intercept the data that's being sent back and forth, thus making it secure to perform sometimes even the most sensitive of tasks, such as handling bank transfers, for instance.</p>
<p>In simple terms, once you enable SSL on your website, you'll make it incredibly more difficult for hackers to breach and/or distort the connection between your site and its visitors.</p>
<p>Luckily, these days, installing an SSL is a straightforward thing to do. Most of the popular web hosts offer a free SSL certificate as part of your main hosting plan. The only thing you need to do is check a couple of boxes in your user panel to enable it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the specific steps differ from host to host. Here's how to get this done with some of the popular providers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bluehost</strong>: <a href="https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/free-ssl">https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/free-ssl</a></li>
<li><strong>SiteGround</strong>: <a href="https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/getting-started/configure-ssl-with-one-click/">https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/getting-started/configure-ssl-with-one-click/</a></li>
<li><strong>GoDaddy</strong>: <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/enable-https-server/">https://www.godaddy.com/garage/enable-https-server/</a></li>
<li><strong>HostGator</strong>: <a href="https://support.hostgator.com/categories/ssl-certificates/ssl-setup-use/">https://support.hostgator.com/categories/ssl-certificates/ssl-setup-use/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're hosting your site with someone else, you'll likely find a similar guide in their documentation as well.</p>
<p>However, even after going through the steps in the user panel of your host, you still have the SSL only <em>partly</em> enabled on your WordPress site. This brings us to the topic of security plugins.</p>

<p>There are tons of different security plugins on the web, all promising to handle one thing or the other for your WordPress website. However, not all of them are essential to have, or rather, few are. So, let's take a minute to discuss the ones that can be truly useful to have on your site. We didn't list them in the previous chapter specifically so that we can cover them in greater depth here.</p>

<p>With SSL enabled on your host's end, it's time to prepare your WordPress website to receive it:</p>
<ol>
<li>This can be done with a plugin called <strong>Really Simple SSL</strong>, which is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/</a>:<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/"/></li>

<ol start="2">
<li>After activating the plugin, you'll see a message like this:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a8507f41-5178-4666-b0b7-f73001630107.png" width="806" height="225"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Go ahead, activate SSL!</span> button. After doing so, you'll immediately get signed out of your WordPress dashboard, but don't worry, this is just part of the process. When you log back in, you'll see that your dashboard is now available under <kbd>https</kbd> instead of the standard <kbd>http</kbd>.</li>
<li>To make sure everything works as it should, visit your website normally and look for the characteristic padlock next to your website's address:</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">General security plugin</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Apart from SSL, you should also get a general security plugin that's going to take care of some other common holes in website security. The plugin we're going to use is called <strong>Wordfence Security</strong>, which is available at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/17911d40-a7c6-4dba-8559-815d46f670d0.png" style="width:43.17em;height:19.58em;" width="956" height="434"/></p>
<p>Getting started with this plugin requires only basic setting up. Immediately upon installing and activating it, you will see an invitation to take the tour and enter your admin email to get notifications about your site's security, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/60f058d2-882b-4fe1-b583-d1e3614b5f1b.png" width="1191" height="552"/></p>
<p>This tour, although short, will present all of the most important features to you and tell you how to work with the plugin effectively. For the most part, the plugin doesn't require any supervision, and thanks to the notification emails, you can just sit back, relax, and wait for the plugin to reach out to you, so to speak:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/a90cc300-9122-4556-9e90-ab3f9a374e4b.png" width="1436" height="654"/></p>
<p>The best way to get started with the plugin is to go to <span class="packt_screen">Wordfence</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Scan</span> from <kbd>wp-admin</kbd>, and then click on the big <span class="packt_screen">START NEW SCAN</span> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/35a51e9d-33a6-46fc-b29f-f8abf9fe3506.png" width="1168" height="612"/></p>
<p>Right after doing so, you will see the scan running. When the scan is done and everything is okay, you will see a row of check marks confirming that the scan was successful:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/996f76d0-30d0-4d13-b1eb-bab2192384bb.png" width="1194" height="211"/></p>
<p>In the event of any problems, Wordfence will display them to you further down the page and will also give you tips on how to solve them. In any case, you can always view the full log of the scan by clicking on the link labeled <span class="packt_screen">VIEW FULL LOG</span> or <span class="packt_screen">SHOW LOG</span> (visible in the preceding screenshot).</p>
<p>Apart from the basic scanning functionality, this plugin also gives you the ability to block individual IP addresses from accessing your site, improve your site's performance with caching, and even make your site inaccessible to whole countries (in case some geographical area causes you serious problems).</p>
<p><span><span>T</span></span>he most important aspect in this regard, however, is that from now on, Wordfence protection runs automatically, and you don't have to do anything yourself actively to keep your site safe. Whenever your attention is required, Wordfence will send you a notification via email and let you know what you should do. This really is a set-it-and-forget-it kind of solution for the most part.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>So far in this book, we've focused on working with a personal website<span>—</span>one that belongs to, and is used by, just one person. However, many blogs are used differently—there may be a single blog or website with a variety of writers, editors, and administrators. This makes the site more like a community project or even an online magazine. Also, it's by no means uncommon for bigger online publishers to use WordPress as the base of their websites, in which case the site has a number of authors, editors, reviewers, and overall contributors with varying responsibilities, not to mention the technical staff or designers. All those people should have their own user accounts when interacting with the site.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if it's just you managing your personal WordPress website, you should still make your own account as secure as possible. In this section, you'll learn all the ins and outs of how to make user accounts secure and how to go about creating them in the first place.</p>
<p>There are three main rules that you should keep in mind whenever creating new user accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each new user account should have sufficient privileges that allow the user to carry out their work, but not more</li>
<li>Don't use obvious usernames, such as <kbd>admin</kbd> or <kbd>user</kbd>; instead, make things a tiny bit more complex, such as by using <kbd>firstname.lastname</kbd></li>
<li>Use strong passwords—you already know that</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's cover that first aspect in a bit more detail—account privileges. Based on who you're creating the user account for, that person will probably not need full admin-level access to your website. In most cases, people will just want to be able to write and publish new posts or pages, and they don't need admin credentials for that. The following is a breakdown of all the user account types available in WordPress, together with what they're intended for.</p>

<p>WordPress allows you to work with an unlimited number of user accounts on your website. Each user can be assigned one of five different roles. Let's look at these roles one at a time, starting with the most powerful one.</p>

<p>When you installed WordPress, it automatically created a user with administrative powers for you. This role is called <em>administrator</em>, and every WordPress site must have at least one admin account (you will not be allowed to delete them all). As you have already seen in the earlier chapters, administrators can do everything.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The administrator's primary purpose is to manage everything about the website.</div>
<p>In general, you don't want to have a lot of administrators on a single blog or website. It is best to keep just one administrator account on a blog with 10 to 20 authors and editors, or perhaps up to three administrators for a blog with dozens of users.</p>
<p>Some examples of the actions that only a user with the administrator role can perform are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch blog theme</li>
<li>Add, edit, activate, or deactivate plugins</li>
<li>Add, edit, or delete users</li>
<li>Manage general blog options and settings</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating more administrator accounts (or managing the main one), make sure to use only complex passwords that are hard to break using any sort of brute-force methods. As we mentioned previously, a lot of hacking attempts revolve around password guessing, so the more complex your password is, the tougher it will be to break.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Editor</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>After the administrator, the <em>editor</em> has the most powerful role. This role is meant for those users who need to manage everything about the content of a website, but who don't need to be able to change the basic structure, design, or functionality of the website itself (that's for administrators).</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The editor's primary purpose is to manage the content of the website.</div>
<p>To get an idea of what the screen looks like when a user logs in as an editor, let's take a look at the editor's menu (on the right) in comparison to the administrator's menu (on the left):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0fb8e5f3-b6cb-4c82-a350-d5374b29b58f.png" style="width:19.92em;height:32.67em;" width="359" height="589"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the top section is unchanged (apart from the <span class="packt_screen">Updates</span> link). However, nearly the entire bottom menu, with <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Users</span> (which is replaced with <span class="packt_screen">Profile</span>), and <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>, has disappeared. We can see that the editor is left with only the ability to edit their own profile and to access the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> section, which includes any plugin pages that allow editor-level users.</p>
<p>The examples of actions that a user with the editor role can perform are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage all posts</li>
<li>Create and edit pages</li>
<li>Moderate comments</li>
<li>Manage categories, tags, and links</li>
<li>Edit other users' content</li>
</ul>
<p>There's one advantageous aspect of the editor's role. If you take a closer look, you'll see that it has all the credentials that you would need to publish any piece of content on a given WordPress site. This makes it perfect for everyday use, even for single-author blogs/sites. Therefore, what I actually encourage you to do is set a separate editor account for yourself, and then use it for posting and editing content, instead of working with the default administrator account. This setup is a lot safer, particularly if someone tries to hijack your password, or in the event of any other mishap to your account, the site itself won't get harmed (because editors can't install new plugins or delete any existing ones).</p>
<p>For multi-author blogs/sites, the editor role is meant to be assigned to users who are in charge of the content published on the site. As the name itself indicates, the <em>editor</em> role is perfect for editors.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Author</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Authors have much less access than editors. Authors can add and edit their own posts, and manage the posts made by their subordinates. However, they can neither edit posts made by other authors nor manage comments on posts that don't belong to them.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The author's primary purpose is to manage their own content.</div>
<p>To get an idea of the experience of a user with the <em>author</em> role, let's take a look at the author's menu (on the right) in comparison to the editor's menu (on the left):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6c3073a1-eb92-4410-911e-ccd1fcd9c6c3.png" style="width:18.08em;height:19.50em;" width="364" height="393"/></p>
<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, the <span class="packt_screen">Pages</span> section has disappeared. Additionally, if the author looks at the complete list of posts, they will only have the ability to <span class="packt_screen">view</span>, but not <span class="packt_screen">edit</span>, <span class="packt_screen">quick edit</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">delete</span> posts that they did not author (highlighted):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6b70fa61-1e83-4e82-9dd4-7691bc3c7d31.png" style="width:25.50em;height:10.58em;" width="585" height="243"/></p>
<p>As you would imagine, the author role is perfect for, well, authors—users who are actively involved in creating content for your site. Authors can, for example, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit and publish their posts</li>
<li>Manage their posts after the publication</li>
<li>Moderate the comments under their posts</li>
</ul>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Contributor</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Contributors are only able to write posts and submit them for review. These posts will be in <span class="packt_screen">Pending Review</span> status until an editor, or administrator, agrees to publish them. Contributors cannot upload images or other files, view the media library, add categories, edit comments, or any of the other tasks available to more privileged users.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The contributor's primary purpose is to submit content for consideration.</div>
<p>One important thing worth mentioning is that although contributors can create and submit their work for review, once the article is published, they no longer have the ability to edit it in any way. However, they do get access to the comments section (for moderation).</p>
<p>When it comes to the real-world applications of this role, it's most commonly used when working with guest bloggers or any other regular contributors who are not part of your in-house team. Guest blogging is really popular nowadays, and handling it through contributor accounts is much less labor-intensive than receiving articles via email and then having to copy and paste them to WordPress.</p>

<p>Subscribers cannot do anything at all, as weird as that might sound. They can only log in and edit their profile (adjust their first name, last name, password, bio information, and so on), and that's it. Depending on the permissions set in <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Discussion</span>, blog visitors may have to sign up as subscribers in order to be able to post comments. Also, there are some plugins that handle sending info updates to subscribers, such as newsletters or email notifications of new posts.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">A subscriber has no editorial power over the website.</div>
<p>Most of the time, this role is used as a placeholder. Take, for example, a specific author who had been contributing to your site regularly in the past, but who hasn't submitted anything in months. Instead of deleting their account completely, you can simply change the role to that of a <em>subscriber</em>.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To manage users, log in (as the administrator, of course) and navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Users</span>. You'll see a list of your existing users, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9bb8a11d-4ce6-4e2a-9bc4-bde41cbd0f97.png" width="865" height="269"/></p>
<p>When we installed WordPress, it just created our first user (which is how we've been logging in all this time). So let's create a new user, and assign that user the next most powerful role—<em>editor</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>To do this, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Users</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>. You'll see the <span class="packt_screen">Add New User</span> form, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/21cafd4f-dc92-45ba-b70b-c79c46168fc4.png" style="width:43.58em;height:40.17em;" width="896" height="827"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In this form, only the <span class="packt_screen">Username</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Email</span> fields are required. The <span class="packt_screen">Password</span> is handled automatically. WordPress will generate a safe password on its own and then send it to the new user once done. You can also change the <span class="packt_screen">Role</span> from the default (<span class="packt_screen">Subscriber</span>) to one of the other roles. In this case, I've selected <span class="packt_screen">Editor</span>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add New User</span> button. Apart from the required fields, it's also good practice to fill in <span class="packt_screen">First Name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Last Name</span>. This can make the task of further managing the user accounts much clearer.</li>
<li>In this example, I'll repeat this process to add an <span class="packt_screen">author</span>, a <span class="packt_screen">contributor</span> and a <span class="packt_screen">subscriber</span>. When I'm done, the <span class="packt_screen">Users</span> page (where the users can be managed) appears as in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/da508d74-3e63-4a4c-9388-1681a550c585.png" width="870" height="600"/></p>
<p>To see the actions that you can perform on each of these new user accounts, just hover your mouse cursor over any of the rows. In this case, you can <span class="packt_screen">edit</span> or <span class="packt_screen">delete</span> users. You can use the checkboxes and the <span class="packt_screen">Bulk Actions</span> menu, or use the filter links to view only users with particular roles. You can change the role of one or more users on this page by checking the box (or boxes) and using the <span class="packt_screen">Change role to...</span> drop-down menu.</p>

<p>Adding users by yourself is not the only way to add users to your WordPress website. You can also give your users the ability to register on their own.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">General</span> and make sure you've checked <span class="packt_screen">Anyone can register</span> next to <span class="packt_screen">Membership</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e1e00d96-cd1e-4fcd-bd13-8a9ba21fa605.png" style="width:32.83em;height:9.33em;" width="485" height="138"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I strongly recommend picking <strong><span class="packt_screen">Subscriber</span></strong> as the <span class="packt_screen">New User Default Role</span>, though <span class="packt_screen">Contributor</span> would also be fine if the purpose of your blog requires it. However, allowing new users to be assigned a role with more power automatically is just asking for trouble.</li>
<li>Next, add a link somewhere on your blog that points people to the login and registration pages. The easiest way to do this is to use the widget named <span class="packt_screen">Meta</span>, which comes with your WordPress installation. It will add a box to your sidebar with a few useful links, including <span class="packt_screen">Log in</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Register</span>.</li>
<li>Users who click on <span class="packt_screen">Register</span> will be taken to the following basic registration page that asks only for their <span class="packt_screen">Username</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Email</span>, as seen in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/d3c8946f-a22f-4f07-ab82-5680d0a2e0fd.png" style="width:25.58em;height:38.83em;" width="491" height="747"/></p>
<p>After submitting this form, the user will be emailed a password, and the main site administrator will be sent an email notification of the new registration taking place. The user can now log in and edit their profile, or do more if an administrator changes their role.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are hundreds of plugins tagged with <em>users</em> in the WordPress plugin directory (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/users">https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/users</a>). We can divide those plugins into many groups, as the functionality offered is extensive. For example, there are plugins for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with various author accounts, co-authoring posts, and multi-author sites</li>
<li>Constructing membership sites around WordPress where members can get access to premium packages of content based on their subscription model</li>
<li>Building a classic e-commerce store where everyone can make a purchase from the available directory of <em>things</em></li>
<li>Creating an online forum based on WordPress</li>
<li>Building an email newsletter sent to a given site's users directly from WordPress, instead of using external services</li>
<li>Launching a social network on WordPress</li>
<li>Managing user profiles for registered users</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the possibilities are striking. If we want to, we can do virtually anything with a WordPress site and its users. Only our imagination imposes a limit. That being said, you should always think about website security when considering any such plugins.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you learned about the principles of WordPress security and how to make sure that your website won't fall victim to hackers or malicious scripts/software. You also learned how to manage a group of users working on a single website or blog.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, it's about time we learn a thing or two about how to control the design of your website. In the next chapter, we discuss themes, and why they're the most exciting part of WordPress.</p>
