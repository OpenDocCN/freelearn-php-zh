    do in order to prepare for building a website was to buy a book on how to learn
    programming in any one of the major web-centric languages like PHP or Perl. Then,
    the not inconsiderable task of learning the niceties of the chosen language to
    a respectable degree would consume a fair chunk of time and patience. Once our
    hapless newcomer had sufficient mastery of the fundamentals, applying that knowledge
    to program efficiently and reliably, with the tenacity to stick with a job until
    the site was developed could arguably be described as a Herculean accomplishment.

    to someone like yourself! It's like forcing lawyers to learn the intricacies of
    architecture, construction, and masonry simply because they require a courtroom
    in which to work. It should be quite apparent that separating the technical task
    of *developing the software* for a website from the *function* of that website
    is a very sensible thing to do, the main reason being that it allows people to
    focus on what they are good at without them having to devote time and energy to
    becoming good software developers too.

    been hard at work pulling the programming world out of the software dark ages
    by providing us with flexible frameworks for building web-based enterprises. These
    frameworks untie website creators from the intellectual burden of learning software
    development ideas and concepts, allowing them instead to focus more on goal-/business-oriented
    configuration and customization tasks.

    seeks to provide you with the fundamental information needed in order to use it
    effectively to meet your requirements. Because this book focuses more on beginner-level
    aspects of administering Drupal, you will be pleased to know that there will be
    little to no coding involved—you're not required to learn how to develop your
    own Drupal modules, for example. That's not to say your introduction will be elementary;
    on the contrary, this book will teach you in such a way that you are able to apply
    your knowledge to tackle problems beyond the scope of this material with confidence.

- en: The most concise description for Drupal is that it is an **Open-Source Content
    Management System**. If you are new to both computing and Drupal, then this probably
    doesn't clear things up very much. Let's analyze this phrase quickly to gain a
    better understanding. First of all, the term *open-source* is used to describe
    *software whose source code is made available, most often subject to certain conditions,
    for use or modification by users or other developers as they deem fit*. The specific
    conditions under which Drupal is made available will be scrutinized more closely
    in the section *The Drupal License* later in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Above and beyond that, what open source means for you as someone who intends
    to make use of Drupal, is that you don't have to pay for this unquestionably valuable
    software. You also join a large community (also to be discussed later in this
    chapter) of Drupal users, developers, and administrators who subscribe to the
    open-source philosophy—in other words, someone out there will probably be willing
    to spend time helping you out should you get stuck.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about it, that's a pretty good deal for those who are still not
    convinced about open‑source technologies as a whole—not only do we not have develop
    the entire site ourselves, but we also get to take advantage of the collective
    wisdom of thousands of other people. Is there anything else we can say about open
    source? Sure for one thing, you can be pretty certain that with an active community
    like the one associated with Drupal, development advances rapidly and flexibly
    because any problems can be spotted early and dealt with effectively. This means
    that you can expect a high level of stability, security, and performance from
    your website.

- en: '*So far so good, but what is the Content Management System (CMS) part all about?*
    It is necessary for us to take a closer look at what this means in order to gain
    a sufficient understanding of what we are getting into. We can define a content
    management system to be *software that facilitates the creation, organization,
    manipulation, and removal of information in the form of images, documents, scripts,
    plain text (or anything else for that matter)*. If you have a need to organize
    and display fairly large amounts of information, especially when it is likely
    that content will be created or delivered from a variety of different sources,
    then a content management system is undoubtedly what you need.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's basically all you have to know. Drupal provides a free platform, along
    with its attendant community, for satisfying a wide variety of content-management
    requirements. Precisely, what type of things one can achieve is the subject of
    the section entitled *What Drupal Has to Offer* later in this chapter. For now
    though, let's turn back the hands of time and take a look at how we ended up with
    Drupal as we know it today.

    a couple of students needing to achieve a specific goal. In this case, Dries Buytaert
    and Hans Snijder of the University of Antwerp wished to share an ADSL modem connection
    to the Internet. They managed this via the use of a wireless bridge, but soon
    after, Dries decided to work on a news site, which would, in addition to the simple
    connection the students already shared, allow them to share news and other information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time the site grew and changed as Dries expanded the application and experimented
    with new things. However, it was only some time later in 2001, when it was decided
    to release the code to the public in the hope that this would encourage development
    from other people, that Drupal became open-source software. It's clear that releasing
    the source to the public was the right choice, because today Drupal has a well
    organized, thriving community of people ranging from approved contributors, forums,
    a security team, and a global presence, to plenty of users who make invaluable
    contributions on a regular basis through bug reports and suggestions.

    and enhances the potential of the Internet as a medium where diverse and geographically
    separated individuals and groups can collectively produce, discuss, and share
    information and ideas. With a central interest in and focus on communities and
    collaboration, Drupal's flexibility allows the collaborative production of online
    information systems and communities.

    for granted that the source code you will use to build your website has been meticulously
    crafted, and well designed. In fact, the previously listed points are taken so
    seriously by the developers of Drupal that they are written into their set of

    whether or not Drupal creates a good environment for your site's users. Obviously,
    a technology that is well designed, and easy to administer would still not be
    very helpful if, for example, its use is prohibitively complex. The best way to
    find out what type of environment Drupal can provide is to go ahead and check
    out the Drupal home page at [http://drupal.org](http://drupal.org). You should
    probably register an account and become active in the community (believe me, it
    will be of great benefit to you in the long run) anyway. So perhaps, treat your
    registration process as a quick and easy way to see a bit of the site.

    tasks that the site must be able to perform (by this I mean a written list, not
    a mental one). Effectively, after creating a list of the various things you need,
    the site's administrator (most probably yourself) should have a clear enough idea
    of the requirements to go ahead and begin working. Unfortunately, it is often
    hard to predict exactly what is needed by simply sitting down and writing. A good
    way to start is by looking at similar sites. You should go ahead and take note
    of everything that is useful and desirable on other sites and add this to your

    everyone to use freely. This might strike you as a little odd at first because
    *what is the point of copyrighting something if you are simply going to let anyone
    else make use of it?* The reason for this is that copyrighting and licensing the
    software gives the developer the power to obligate people who use that software
    to afford everyone they hand it out to (with or without modifications) the same
    rights that are vested in the original software.

- en: What this means is that, effectively, anyone who makes use of this software
    cannot create proprietary software from it. So, if you decide to build upon and
    improve Drupal yourself in order to sell it on as your own product, then you will
    be bound by the same terms and will have to release your source code to anyone
    who asks for it. Remember though, the aim of the GPL is not to take credit for
    your own work by forcing you to release it under the GPL. If you have developed
    identifiable programs or code that are wholly your own and are independent from
    the original source code provided, then the GPL does not necessarily apply to
    your work.

    all you really need to know is that it is both free in terms of price and in terms
    of who gets access to its source code. The cynics among you may be saying something
    like: *This all sounds like a bunch of hooey. You can''t even provide a warranty
    or guarantee that the software will work because no one has the money to pay for
    real development*. Well, you don''t need to worry about that. Open-source software
    is among the best and most reliable in the world exactly because everyone in the

    Drupal administrator is being able to make efficient use of the community. By
    now you should have registered on the Drupal site and taken at least a cursory
    glance at much of it. As time goes by, you will hopefully develop relationships
    with other members and eventually become a great asset for the community at large.

    be built throughout the rest of the book. This demonstrated that even at a beginner
    level we are able to create an extremely powerful web-based application that can
    be used to drive entire communities—all without having to learn any programming
    at all. That's not to say that there is no work involved—no doubt you found researching
    and deciding on what your site requires fairly tedious. Remember though that any
    background work you put in now will pay off later; so it's definitely worth it.
