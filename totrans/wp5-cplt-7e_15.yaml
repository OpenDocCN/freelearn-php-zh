- en: As you have seen while reading this book, WordPress comes fully equipped to
    power a blog, with all of the particular requirements of post handling, categorization,
    chronological display, and so on, that come with a blog. However, powering blogs
    is not WordPress' only purpose. Not anymore. In fact, there are millions of websites
    out there right now that run WordPress, but where blogging is not the primary
    focus of the website. I myself have built a number of such sites.

    used mostly as a business card-type site, or used by businesses that don''t have
    a lot of content to showcase on their site. Even though the whole site is comprised
    of just a page, the designs are usually attractive, with a lot of dynamic transition
    effects and parallax scrolling backgrounds.'

    number of products and then use a shopping cart to make a purchase. Apart from
    the shopping cart functionality, there''s also online payment integration and
    often a backend inventory management system.'

    only to those users who have signed up for a membership and (often) paid a small
    fee for the privilege; such members-only areas can contain any type of content
    that the site owner finds suitable—WordPress doesn''t limit this in any way.'

    posts, the blogger publishes video posts.'

    say that it's any kind of website where the blog is not the main functionality
    used by the website owner. And of course, non-blog websites make up the majority
    of the internet as a whole. However, since we're discussing WordPress here, which
    many still believe to be a blog system only, I just want to assure you that this
    is no longer the case. These days, WordPress can be used for virtually anything.

    have to start by installing WordPress properly. This is exactly what we talked
    about in [Chapter 2](2b45497f-48bb-4756-9fe5-abc1715f3e8d.xhtml), *Getting Started
    with WordPress*. Virtually, nothing is different at this point. The installation
    process is the same, all of the steps are the same, and the final result is the
    same too—you end up with a clean, blank WordPress installation. Also, whenever
    installing specific themes and plugins, make sure to follow the same guidelines
    that we discussed in [Chapter 5](1f05677b-dcae-4511-9add-b4cf68718507.xhtml),
    *Plugins – What They Are and Why You Need Them,* and [Chapter 7](ffd72a00-558a-4dfc-a5c2-83f6051196a7.xhtml),

    any specific themes or plugins. The secret is your mindset as the developer. In

- en: Firstly, let's tackle one common misconception. The point of a static website
    isn't to make the content hard coded into the HTML or PHP files at all. The actual
    point is to abandon the standard chronological organization of content (to abandon
    the blog functionality) and to focus on building a site where pages exist on their
    own, independently of one another. So, in the end, we can still edit everything
    pretty easily through `wp-admin`, and the only difference is that we're not using
    the standard WordPress posts for anything. Instead, we're focusing on the WordPress
    pages.

    and Installing Themes*); this is a mandatory step for all types of non-blog websites.
    Quite simply, not every theme will fit every type of website. So, whenever picking
    a specific one, keep in mind what you want to use the website for—this is going
    to make your work easier as a developer and make the website better for future
    visitors once the site is launched.

    posts) and uses it as the home page. This is not the desired situation in our
    case, since there will be no posts. What we'll do instead is create a custom page
    and then use it as a static front page (home page).
  prefs: []

    *Pages, Media, and Importing/Exporting Content*. Therefore, let's just focus on
    a basic overview here, but feel free to go back to [Chapter 4](https://cdp.packtpub.com/wordpress_complete___7th_edition/wp-admin/post.php?post=35&action=edit#post_27),* Pages,

    on any other page. You can call it HOME to make it clear what it is for. What
    you place on this page is up to you. Essentially, a home page should be a great
    starting page for anyone who visits a given site for the first time. For instance,
    you can go with a short introductory message, a list of some popular articles
    on your site, a contact form provided by the Contact Form 7 plugin, and an interactive
    map by *Google Maps*. You can place all of those elements using the new block-editor
    that's in WordPress.

    the *front page*. This can be done in Settings | Reading, as discussed in [Chapter

    *Developing Your Own Theme*), which will allow you to include any design elements
    you might need, along with a wealth of custom functionality. Again, it all depends

    apparent that their construction is very similar to static websites. The only
    difference is that they are much bigger (with more pages and more content), and
    their design seems much more official. Also, most businesses like to publish some
    occasional announcements, so a blog-like functionality is required too (but it
    still won't be the main element on the site).

    (or building) the right theme. If you do a quick bit of research on the web, you'll

- en: One-page websites are a relatively new invention in the online world. A couple
    of years ago, webmasters were not that keen on having just a single page to make
    up their entire website. It simply seemed like not working hard enough on your
    website's presence. These days, however, things have changed. It's no longer looked
    down on. In fact, single-page websites are the new trend.

- en: In some way, a one-page or a single-page website is similar to a static website.
    You mostly get to work with WordPress pages rather than its blog functionality,
    and after you set that page in place, it will likely stay that way for a longer
    period of time—that is, it will remain static. On one-page websites, though, you
    simply get to work with only one page as opposed to having a number of them.

    However, each block on this page is visually separated from the previous and the
    next one. This visual separation is one of the most important aspects of single-page
    websites. So, as with many types of websites, creating a truly great-looking one-page
    site is about picking the right theme—something that your target audience will
    enjoy and appreciate. The easiest way to build a great one-page site with WordPress
    is to do the following:'

    theme stores across the web. The best places to go find them include, again, the
    official directory ([https://wordpress.org/themes/](https://wordpress.org/themes/)),
    ThemeIsle ([https://themeisle.com/](https://themeisle.com/)), and ThemeForest
    ([https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress](https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress)).
    Not all of them, however, feature specialized categories for one-page themes,
    so you might have to use the search option to find something interesting. Searching
    for terms such as *single page* or *one page* should give you great results.

- en: Branding elements are particularly important with one-page sites because, by
    definition, you don't get much online real estate to work with, so to speak. If
    there's just one page on the site, you need to make sure that it's as in tune
    with your brand and identity as possible. Therefore, a good theme should allow
    you to place elements, such as your own logo, social media links, and custom graphics,
    in places such as the header, footer, and the background. Luckily, those sorts
    of features are considered the standard among modern WordPress themes, so you
    probably won't have to worry about this part at all.

- en: One of the main flaws with one-page themes is that they often rely heavily on
    good visuals and high-quality images. The designs are often simple and very minimalist,
    and their attractive appearance is based on the images used in the background
    of the site. Unfortunately, finding such images is entirely up to you. Themes
    rarely come with unique images that you will be able to use on your site.
  prefs: []

    that's one solution. But you can also get a lot of great images for free in places
    such as [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/). The last solution is,
    of course, to take your own photos and use them on your site.

    | Customize. You''ll see a large customization panel there. With it, I can change
