- en: The traditional Web, where websites are viewed by people on desktop computers,
    is obsolete. Web content is now viewed in a myriad of ways by users with mobile
    phones, tablets, and even watches. Content on the Internet may not be consumed
    directly by humans at all—web services now power apps on our phones and almost
    every device that's part of the emerging and much lauded Internet of Things.

- en: Drupal is evolving to reflect the changes we're seeing on the Internet as a
    whole, and Drupal 8 represents a big technological leap forward for open source
    content management systems. Its central focus is shifting from building websites,
    where desktop users came first, to supporting a whole range of ways in which content
    is now consumed on the Internet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Drupal 8 comes with mobile-first, responsive themes by default. HTML5 is baked
    in, making Drupal content viewable by any user with a device that supports a web
    browser. RESTful web services are included in Drupal 8 core, meaning that Drupal
    content can be consumed through apps or other machines, as well as through the
    traditional web browser.

- en: Unsurprisingly, major changes in the way Drupal is used are accompanied by some
    major changes in the way you will be working with it as a developer. This book
    will guide you through the exciting and far-reaching changes that Drupal 8 brings.
    You'll learn how to build complex, powerful web applications by configuring Drupal
    without having to write any code. You'll also learn how to create responsive,
    mobile-first themes, write custom modules, and manage your Drupal projects using
    modern incremental development techniques.

- en: If you're already a PHP developer, Drupal 8 is going to be an exhilarating ride
    for you. Modern object-orientated programming techniques that use many elements
    of the Symfony PHP framework are going to help you write more flexible, robust,
    and reusable code. The Drupal community will be attracting more and more non-Drupal
    PHP programmers over the coming years, as it's more elegant and cutting edge than
    before. Whether or not you're part of the Drupal community, there has never been
    a better, more exciting time to get heavily involved.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow the examples in this book, you'll need a computer on which you can
    set up your own development environment with a number of useful tools. All these
    tools are either open source or have free equivalents. The PhpStorm IDE mentioned
    in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Setting Up a Drupal Development Environment"),
    *Setting Up a Drupal Development Environment*, is a proprietary and fairly expensive
    piece of software, but you could also use NetBeans or Eclipse as alternative IDEs,
    as they have comparable features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're also going to need an Internet connection. Many of the examples in this
    book rely on external services such as GitHub or PuPHPet and you'll have to do
    some fairly large downloads if you're installing some of the recommended software
    packages from scratch.
