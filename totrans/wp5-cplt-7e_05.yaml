    you've probably noticed that WordPress offers you a lot more than simply posts,
    comments, tags, and categories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we will explore and learn to control all the other types of
    content that WordPress lets you use. You'll be able to create static pages that
    aren't a part of your ongoing blog, add various types of media to your posts,
    and create appealing image galleries to display photos and other images.

- en: At first glance, pages look very similar to posts. Both pages and posts have
    a title and a content area in which we can write extended text, add images, and
    so on. However, pages are handled quite differently from posts. First of all,
    pages don't have categories or tags (pages don't need to be categorized, since
    on most websites, there are a lot fewer pages than posts). Moreover, posts belong
    to your blog and are meant to be a part of an ongoing, expanding publication revolving
    around specific topics. Posts are added regularly, whereas pages are more static
    and aren't generally expected to change that much.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, I would advise you to think of pages as pieces of static content,
    and posts as a series of articles that are published in a timely manner. In other
    words, pages are meant to hold content that is equally up to date, no matter when
    someone reads it. For instance, the things that people publish via WordPress pages
    are most commonly details pertaining to their company or business, team, and other
    related and evergreen details. Posts are often very time-sensitive and present
    advice/news that's important today/now. For most blogs, posts are the pillars
    of their content and make up more than 90 percent of the entire content catalog.

    WordPress uses it for both posts and pages.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WordPress allows you to structure your pages hierarchically. This way, you can
    organize everything into *main pages* and *subpages*, which is useful if you're
    going to have a bigger number of pages on your site. For example, if I were to
    write a blog along with three other authors, we would each have one page about
    us on the site, but those would be subpages of the main *About* page. If I was
    adding one of these pages, I'd first create a new *About* page (the main one),
    then create another page just for me, called *About Karol*, and finally choose
    that main *About* page as the parent for the new page.

    page title. If you want them in some other order, you can specify this by entering
    numbers in the Order box for each of your pages. Pages with lower numbers (for
    example, 0) will be listed before pages with higher numbers (for example, 5).
    You can easily test this by editing some of your pages and assigning various numbers
    to them.

    pages, especially if you want them displayed in a menu. You can do this much more
    easily by working with menus directly (as described in [Chapter 8](7ecd502d-b30d-40d9-8b58-623323b644e5.xhtml),
    *Customizing Your Website Appearance/Design*). In the end, I would advise you
