<p>In the previous chapter, we reviewed the basics of Moodle and learned how to get started with site-wide settings and configurations. Now we will take a step back and review the basics of pedagogy and instructional design. They are important as you set up your educational programs and build courses in Moodle. If you fail to take pedagogy and instructional design into consideration early in the process, you run the risk of having to rebuild your courses later, which can be very tedious, time consuming, and expensive (in terms of labor). So, it's a great idea to bookmark this chapter and return to it often, each time you begin to develop a new program, course template, demo course, or individual courses.</p>
<p>Let's start with a fundamental question: what would you like your students to be able to do after they complete your course?</p>
<p>It sounds like a simple question, but it's the key to setting up an effective structure for your Moodle course and also to selecting the best possible resources, activities, and assessments. <em>You will map all of your resources, activities, and assessments to the learning objectives, so the learning objectives (the concrete statements of what your students should be able to do to demonstrate their knowledge or skills) are what you should keep in mind at every possible moment. </em></p>
<p>So, it is doubly important to keep in mind, as you plan your course, it is important to keep in mind what you want your students to learn and, then, how you would like them to demonstrate their skills and knowledge. In doing so, you can plan your course so that it has a clear, logical structure, and that the elements tie neatly together and reinforce one another.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We'll learn how to use course-level learning outcomes as the foundation for your course. Using course-level learning outcomes, we're starting with the "big-picture" view. Then, we'll take a closer look at each of the sections in your course and learn how to create more specific learning outcomes that will serve as the framework that ties the big-picture goals to the resources, activities, and assessments of your course. With such a solid foundation and framework, you'll never feel lost or frustrated as you build your course. Instead, you'll feel confident as you select your course's resources, activities, and assessments.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing and using learning outcomes spanning the course</li>
<li>The importance of outlining learning outcomes</li>
<li>The ideal course structure</li>
<li><strong>Universal Design for Learning</strong> (<strong>UDL</strong>)</li>
<li>Selecting resources and activities </li>
<li>Effective assessment strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the best ways to start planning your course is by thinking about what you'd like your students to be able to do when they successfully complete it. At the same time, it is good to envision how they should demonstrate their new knowledge or skill. What your students are able to do as a result of taking the course are the learning outcomes of the course. Both terms refer to the notion of a course, that is, they focus not just on the content to be covered, but also on the skills, abilities, beliefs, and attitudes that result upon completion of the course.</p>
<p>It is important to place your learning objectives on your course's front page so that they are constantly in the mind of your students. Here is an example from the course, <span class="packt_screen">Trends in Tourism</span>. Notice how the learning objectives appear on the front page, and they are accompanied by a photo to help call attention to them, without being distracting:</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/742c543b-3fe2-4588-be50-01ee087f3477.png" style="width:61.50em;height:36.17em;"/></div>
<div>
<p>Learning outcomes encompass the knowledge, skills, and abilities that the students should gain on completing the course. Learning outcomes are known by other terms as well. They are often referred to as course outcomes, course objectives, learning objectives, and student-learning outcomes. In all cases, they are important because they shape every aspect of your course, from selecting content and activities to creating assessments that determine whether the course or the learning program was effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can learn more about learning outcomes in the <em>Quick Tips for Writing Learning Outcomes</em> section at the Office of the Provost at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Visit this section at <a href="http://provost.rpi.edu/learning-assessment/learning-outcomes/quick-tips-writing-learning-outcomes">http://provost.rpi.edu/learning-assessment/learning-outcomes/quick-tips-writing-learning-outcomes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As you consider what you would like your students to do, you are incorporating a student-centric approach that puts more emphasis on <em>how</em> they should do something as opposed to <em>what</em> they should do, which results in a more active approach. Instead of thinking about what you'd like to teach, you're considering how to facilitate the learning process.</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Cognitive psychology as applied to learning</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<div>
<p><span>For those who are interested in what is going on beneath the surface, let's take a moment to review the cognitive processes involved in learning. As we design a course, we should consider how the mind makes meaning, how knowledge occurs, and what the ideal conditions are for creating an optimal environment for learning.</span></p>
<p><span>Cognitive psychology is the category of social sciences that covers the learning process, and it perfectly encompasses the processes we must understand to design an excellent course.</span></p>
<p>To maintain a clear focus, we will begin and end with learning objectives (also referred to as <em>outcomes</em>). The learning objectives encompass the cognitive psychology processes and fields in learning. Now, how do we write good learning objectives? Because you are focusing on student performance and bearing in mind what you'd like your students to do and how they should be able to demonstrate their new knowledge, skills, and abilities, your outcomes need to be written with a plan of action in mind.</p>
<p>So, we can apply these ideas from the very beginning as we develop a course in Moodle. We have the learning outcomes. Now Moodle gives us the opportunity to structure the course so that each unit ties to a topic. Each topic can directly link to a learning objective or a course outcome. </p>
<p>Here's an example from the Tourism Trends course. The first page has the overall learning objectives and, then, as we create a structure for the course, each topic corresponds to a learning objective. Notice in the screenshot, that there are eight topics. If this is an eight-week course, each topic can correspond to one week. If it's a 16-week course, each one can correspond to two weeks. </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/679c02d9-9278-4788-a55f-3df024fedbad.png" style="width:38.25em;height:37.83em;"/></p>
<p>So, as you go through the process of determining what the learning objectives should be for your course, jot them down. You may come up with a long list, but, later, make sure that you select the ones that best reflect what you'd like your students to achieve. We'd like to follow best practices for instructional design, so we recommend that your final list should contain not more than six or seven objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>You can learn more about best practices for developing learning and performance outcomes in the classic work <em>The Systematic Design of Instruction</em> by Walter Dick and Lou Cary in 1978. Their work was so influential that it came to be known as the <em>Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model</em> and was widely adopted by instructional designers and training developers. For an overview of the <em>Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model</em>, you may visit the <span class="packt_screen">Big Dog &amp; Little Dog's Performance Juxtaposition</span> page at <a href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/history_isd/carey.html">http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/history_isd/carey.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>To transform your informal list of desired outcomes to formal learning outcomes statements, you may benefit from using the <strong>SMART</strong> approach, which was first developed by George T Doran in the November, 1981 issue of <em>Management Review</em>. Since it was first published, it has become very popular in many applications that need to measure goals and outcomes. The criteria are very handy for making sure that your statements are complete.<em> In addition, they are very good for goal-setting and motivation. </em>Here are the SMART guidelines, where your outcomes should be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific</strong>: Make sure that the desired outcomes are not too broad</li>
<li><strong>Measurable</strong>: Include a quantity or a way to measure progress</li>
<li><strong>Attainable</strong>: Your desired outcomes need to be achievable</li>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>: Make sure that the desired outcomes relate to your course</li>
<li><strong>Time bound</strong>: Make it clear by when the objective should be achieved</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write your SMART outcomes, be sure to avoid verbs or phrases such as <em>understand</em>, <em>appreciate</em>, <em>know about</em>, <em>familiarize yourself with</em>, and <em>develop an awareness of</em>. Instead, use active verbs and phrases that connote measurable results, such as <em>identify</em>, <em>describe</em>, <em>analyze</em>, <em>evaluate</em>, and <em>create</em>. Look back at the guidelines <em>for writing learning outcomes</em>, and you'll see that some of your original outcomes may not be measurable and may also have other deficiencies. Once you recognize that, be sure to change them as soon as you can. This will allow you to create a map that ties the learning outcomes to your resources, activities, and assessments.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Bloom's taxonomy</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As you start to shape your learning outcomes, many teachers and course designers find it very useful to use <strong>Bloom's taxonomy</strong> as a guide. Benjamin Bloom was an educational psychologist who helped develop a classification scheme for learning objectives that reflects how to show mastery in different skills, knowledge areas, and abilities.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The result—Bloom's taxonomy—is a series of six different categories of cognitive skills, which ascend from the most basic types to the most complex ones.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can learn more about Bloom's taxonomy in the <em>A Model of Learning Objectives</em> section on Iowa State University's Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching page. You may enjoy the mouse-over interactive graphics that display sample learning outcomes that correspond to key action/outcome verbs. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy">http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy</a>.</div>
<p>Revised in 2001, there are six levels of Bloom's taxonomy, which ascend from the lowest to the highest cognitive skills as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge/remembering</li>
<li>Comprehension/understanding</li>
<li>Application/applying</li>
<li>Analysis/analyzing</li>
<li>Evaluation/evaluating</li>
<li>Synthesis/creating</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use Bloom's taxonomy to create your learning outcomes using verbs that describe student learning. Bloom's taxonomy can help you take a building block approach to teaching and learning by starting with the least complex cognitive skill category (knowledge/remembering) and then moving up through the levels so that by the end of the course, your students are able to synthesize and create the information. Be sure to keep your learning objectives to six or seven. Too many learning outcomes will complicate your mapping process and result in duplications. The following diagram shows how the skills ascend with complexity:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6681dc2a-ff2f-4ebc-801d-f37c282f3f45.png" style="width:11.17em;height:13.33em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Skills ascending with complexity</span></div>
<p>After you have created the six or seven learning outcomes for your course, keep in mind that you're aiming for outcomes at a variety of different levels. Then, you will need to assemble them in ascending order of complexity. Doing so will help you organize the way you present the material and select your resources and activities. It will also create scaffolding in which your students use the material they've just learned to ascend to the next level.</p>
<p>So, let's apply Bloom's taxonomy to our <span class="packt_screen">Tourist Trend</span> course. We've already built the course learning objectives. We've divided the course in units that correspond to the different objectives. Now let's look at how we can go into each topic or unit and write unit-learning objectives that correspond to Bloom's taxonomy. </p>
<p>As you may recall, our first topic is <span class="packt_screen">New Definitions of Tourism</span>. So, let's go in and add a resource. In this case, let's add a <strong>page. </strong>We can give the page a name: <span class="packt_screen">Unit Learning Objectives</span>. Then, let's write learning objectives that tie directly to a definition of tourism. Let's start with the lower-level Bloom's Taxonomy level ("remembering") and then ascend to "understanding." This screenshot shows how the page will look: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3fc7046a-4ed4-4cc9-85da-d6273208d830.png" style="width:40.17em;height:28.17em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Now you can probably see where we're going with this. As companions to the Unit Learning Objectives page, we can add a resource that provides instructional material illustrative of each learning objective. We can add an activity that asks the learner to apply the knowledge or concepts. Then, finally, we can add an activity that will also serve as a summative assessment and determine whether or not the learner demonstrated mastery. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>Before we start to expand the course, we recommend that you take a moment to plan your course so that it complies with standards and recommendations that have been set to accommodate students' diverse needs and abilities. To do so, we will follow what is referred to as the UDL, which are guidelines that assure accessibility services for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>In this section, we will look at legal requirements but keep in mind that the UDL has its roots in ethics, human dignity, and the belief that all individuals deserve to have access to education.</p>
<p>However, in returning to legal frameworks that assure accessibility services to individuals who may have disability issues, let's remember that we must comply with the laws and regulations that have been enacted to provide equal access to them. In the United States, the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> (<strong>ADA</strong>) (1990) protects the civil rights of individuals living with disabilities and requires academic organizations to make educational programs available to students with disabilities. Do not forget to check for similar laws and regulations in your region since they vary from country to country.</p>
<p>We know that each student has a unique set of abilities and strengths and we also realize that all students possess their own learning styles. So, we need to make sure we design courses that are compliant in the following ways and follow the guidelines set forth in the <em>Higher Education Opportunity Act</em> of 2008; they follow three primary principles as listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple means of representation</li>
<li>Multiple means of access and expression</li>
<li>Multiple means of engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>In an online course, and a learning management system such as Moodle, you have the flexibility to comply with the previous three principles. For a complete guide to the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, you may visit the US Department of Education website at <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html">http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html</a>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Depending on where they live, students with disabilities or special needs may qualify for government-funded programs that provide them with financial support or low-cost assistive technology.</p>
<p>At this point, you may be feeling very nervous and overwhelmed about adhering to complicated rules and regulations. Don't worry; assistive technology has made great strides in the last few years, and many such technologies are very low cost and easy to implement. For example, there are many text-to-voice screen readers and voice recognition programs that convert the spoken word to text. Grand Canyon University has put together an excellent list, which you may find at <a href="http://www.gcu.edu/Disability-Office/Assistive-Technology.php">http://www.gcu.edu/Disability-Office/Assistive-Technology.php</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, many cloud-based applications now incorporate assistive and transformative technologies. For example, if you upload a video or an audio file to YouTube, while you are in <span class="packt_screen">Studio</span> mode, you can use <span class="packt_screen">Speech to Text</span> to generate a transcript for your audio. You can also use applications such as <span class="packt_screen">Speechnotes</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Google Speech to Text</span> with your smartphone to record thoughts or a lecture that automatically generates a transcript/text version. Likewise, <span class="packt_screen">Text to Speech</span> is often as simple (and can be obtained for free) in applications in the cloud.</p>
<p>Don't forget that reasonable accommodation can be achieved in many different ways, ranging from assistive technologies to something as simple as finding a person who can read to a vision-impaired learner.</p>
<p>The most important consideration when you're planning your course is preparation. Prepare for students with diverse abilities and needs and design a course that builds in the <em>multiple means</em> concept in the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. Remember that it's much more difficult to redesign and retrofit your course than it is to design it well from the very beginning.</p>

<p>As you plan your course and select course material, remember that you should provide a choice of materials that allow students to achieve the learning outcome. What this means in practical terms is that if you are providing text, you will need to ensure that you provide it in a form that can be read by a screen reader for vision-impaired learners. If you are providing videos, you will need to include a script for hearing-impaired readers. A simple way to achieve this principle is by building in redundancy.</p>

<p>As you build your course, be sure to provide different ways for students to act and interact. For example, instead of simply providing readings and quizzes, you may wish to include a discussion forum where you ask your students to discuss questions that help them learn the material and to share drafts of their papers.</p>
<p>You may also want to build in activities that allow students to express themselves by creating documents that include graphics as well as text. In a different scenario, if you have a student who has difficulty typing, you may allow them to hand in an audio recording.</p>

<p><em>Student engagement</em> means that students are interacting during the course. They may be interacting with automated quizzes or be engaged in a discussion with their peers. They may also be asked to go online and conduct research.</p>
<p>Moodle has built in many activities that encourage students to use different ways in which to engage with the material in a course. In addition to the forum and a wide array of activities, Moodle also integrates with web conferencing software programs and services, such as <span class="packt_screen">BigBlueButton</span>, and offers integration with Skype.</p>

<p>Let's return to our course. Now that you can write effective learning outcomes and have used them to build your course framework, which is structured around topics, let's return to adding resources and activities and let's look at matching learning activities with resources and activities.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Let's return to <span class="packt_screen">Topic 1: New Definitions of Tourism</span>. Let's say that we want to start by adding content that helps define tourism. What might that include? Here are our options from the pull-down menu that says <span class="packt_screen">Add a resource</span>. Note that there is another pull-down menu next to it that says <span class="packt_screen">Add an activity</span>. Keep in mind that we are using the <span class="packt_screen">Boost</span> theme and that there may be slight variations with other themes: <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0cbdacee-dd1f-4756-b5bb-5d06cc621fa4.png" style="width:14.25em;height:17.25em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Adding a resource</div>
<p>So, we could choose to add a file which consists of an article with examples of tourism. Or we could create a folder and fill it with different articles and maps. Another useful item is a <span class="packt_screen">Page</span>, in which we can write definitions, plus include links to outside videos, audio files, maps, images, and texts. </p>
<p>Now, let's say that we'd like the learner to collaborate with other learners, or to do something interactive that allows them to apply their knowledge. That's where<span class="packt_screen"> Add an activity </span>comes into play. Moodle has a nice selection of prepackaged activities that range from collaboration-engendering discussion forums, workshops, and webinars, to engaging "check your knowledge" activities, such as choice, and a quiz: </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a35813e8-85b4-466e-ac75-8678fe006d79.png" style="width:12.75em;height:29.00em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter packt_figref CDPAlign">Adding an Activity</div>
<p>When you add each element, make sure that it directly connects to your learning outcome and that you explain how those connections are made. Also, this is a good time to remind yourself of the UDL and how best to meet the needs of students with a wide range of skills and abilities.</p>

<p>Moodle provides a wide array of options as you determine the best way to let your students demonstrate that they have achieved the knowledge, skills, and abilities that the learning outcomes have defined.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If you've kept in mind the key questions, "What do I want my students to do?" and "How will they show their skills, knowledge, attitudes, and abilities?", you will find that it will be much easier to develop the appropriate assessment strategy. The following are a few guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that each topic's assessment ties directly to the learning outcome for that particular topic. Your assessment should be of sufficient complexity to allow your students to demonstrate that they have achieved the learning outcome.</li>
<li>Each of your resources and activities need to connect both to the learning outcome, as well as the assessment.</li>
<li>Try to incorporate as much collaboration and interaction as possible to reinforce the learning strategy incorporated into the initial activity.</li>
<li>You should give students an opportunity to practice the assessment, and they should be able to obtain feedback when they make errors or need guidance.</li>
<li>If you have an end-of-course final assessment, make sure that it covers all of the learning outcomes covered in the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have developed your assessment strategies, you can begin to add them to each of the topics. Make sure that your assessments are clear and straightforward and that they help your students develop a sense of confidence, which will, in turn, encourage them to stay engaged and complete the course.</p>
<p>Some of the ways in which you can help develop self-efficacy and an "I can do it!" attitude that also relate to the overall assessment strategy are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include activities (quizzes, "test your knowledge" multiple-choice questions, and practice tests</li>
<li>Include collaborative activities that include peer reviews</li>
<li>Include interactive graphics</li>
<li>Use badges and certificates within Moodle to encourage the achievement of mini milestones</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting activities that prepare students to perform well in their assessments is a powerful way to achieve learning outcomes and to assure course completion.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we've learned the best way to write learning outcomes for your course and use them to shape the structure of your course and select resources, activities, and assessments. We explained how and why following the UDL enables students with disabilities to take and succeed in the courses, while also complying with legally mandated regulations. We have also reviewed how those learning outcomes (and objectives) affect the selection of resources and activities in your course. In addition, we have described how the type of assessments you use throughout your course will help demonstrate the student's mastery/achievement in the course.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will guide you through organizing your course. We'll take a close look at how best to match the organization of your course with the overall purpose of the course, and the types of students you're likely to be teaching.</p>
