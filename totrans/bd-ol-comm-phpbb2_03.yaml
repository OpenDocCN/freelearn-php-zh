    a registration confirmation by e-mail in order to activate a user account. If
    such confirmation is required, an e-mail is sent to the address provided in this
    field. Many phpBB administrators opt for e-mail confirmation just to make sure
    that users enter valid e-mail addresses. This has a very good reason—if you don’t
    require the e-mail confirmation and users register with fake e-mail addresses,
    you’ll start receiving lots of bounced messages to your admin e-mail address.
    Why these bouncing messages? Well, phpBB will send e-mails on your account (you’ll
    be the sender), for private-message notifications, topics-watch notifications,
    and so on, and on mail-delivery failures due to wrong recipient addresses, these
    mails bounce back to the sender. |'

    the users to verify that they’ve entered their intended password correctly. A
    note about the passwords: they are encrypted before they are saved to the database
    using the MD5 one-way encryption algorithm. In plain English: there’s no way for
    a saved password to be retrieved; at least the modern computer algorithms are
    not capable of doing it. This means that only the users know their passwords.
    If a user forgets a password, there’s a procedure to create a new password, but
    none to restore the old one. |'

    is appended to the bottom of every post made by the user. It can contain links,
    URLs, and formatting, and is often used to add a touch of personality. People
    use it for various reasons like favorite wisdom quotes, funny quotes, or self-advertising.
    The way people use it can sometimes vary depending on what the community is about.
    In some rare occasions, it can actually be used for its original purpose—to contain
    the name of the poster or anything that looks like a real signature. The way to

    a link to a specific post, as opposed to a link to the topic in general. To get

    look at the bold tag, as it’s probably the tag that’s used the most. If you want
    to bold the word "fun" in the sentence "Posting is fun", you type (or use the
    toolbar to produce the same result) "`Posting is [b]fun[/b]`". These tags might
    look scary if this is your first acquaintance with them, but are really easy once
    you get used to them.

    we’re all used to. The interface for writing a PM is the same as for writing a

    you can look up a username if you’re not sure about the spelling.

    At this point its final. Sometimes it can so happen that a user receives an e-mail
    and a popup window notification about a new PM and when this user goes to the
    inbox, there are no new messages. This does not happen very often, because the
    ability to edit or delete messages in the outbox is a somewhat hidden feature
    that most people are not aware of. But in any event, be prepared to answer the

- en: An IP address is a numeric identifier, unique for every computer connected to
    the Internet. IP stands for Internet Protocol. Internet Service Providers (ISP)
    all over the world assign IP addresses to their clients every time an Internet
    connection is requested. This means that if you connect to the Internet, disconnect,
    and reconnect, the IP address assigned to you the second time may be different
    from that assigned the first time.

    phpBB will try to resolve (give a friendlier representation of) the IP address.
    This feature may not always work, because not all IP addresses can be resolved.
    In the example above, the numeric IP address will be resolved as shown in the

    no information if it cannot be resolved. Keep in mind:'

    often, because ISPs change the IP addresses assigned to their clients. Also, a

    home and office computers).

    Although its a probable scenario, its not necessarily always the case. Two users
    may have the same ISP (or may be employed at the same company) and thus may have
    the same IP address. Another explanation is that two users are friends and one
    is using the others computer and Internet connection to post. And yet another—two
    users are posting from the same Internet club (game club, Internet café, etc.).

- en: phpBB takes the security aspects of running a bulletin board really seriously.
    That’s why there is a powerful and options-rich system of permissions and user
    privileges. You’ll find some more detailed information about the permissions system
    in Chapter 5, which contains details on some advanced phpBB features. You’ll also
    find more information in the phpBB user guide. So before you start playing around
    with the permissions, make sure you know what you’re doing. For now, we’ll just
    take a quick look into the permissions that are used most often, and leave the
    details for later.

    Using the simple mode, you can pick permission patterns (a set of advanced permissions
    grouped together to be easier to use) from a list of preset values. Example options
    for simple mode are "Public" forum, "Registered" forum, and "Hidden" forum.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'These simple options are carefully analyzed and selected by the phpBB team,
    so using them instead of the advanced options is probably the safest thing to
    do until you are comfortable managing forum and user permissions. Let this be
    your rule of thumb: use the simple mode unless you have a good reason not to and
    you know what you’re doing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The two simple mode options used the most frequently are "Registered" and "Public".
    To get a rough idea, in a "Public" forum, a visitor doesn’t have to be a registered
    user in order to post. In a "Registered" forum, only registered users can post.
    In both cases, only moderators and administrators can use more advanced features
    like specifying topic-type (sticky and announcement) or editing and deleting other
    people’s posts.
  prefs: []
