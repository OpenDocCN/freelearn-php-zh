- en: '| E-mail address* | User’s e-mail address. The forum can be configured to request
    a registration confirmation by e-mail in order to activate a user account. If
    such confirmation is required, an e-mail is sent to the address provided in this
    field. Many phpBB administrators opt for e-mail confirmation just to make sure
    that users enter valid e-mail addresses. This has a very good reason—if you don’t
    require the e-mail confirmation and users register with fake e-mail addresses,
    you’ll start receiving lots of bounced messages to your admin e-mail address.
    Why these bouncing messages? Well, phpBB will send e-mails on your account (you’ll
    be the sender), for private-message notifications, topics-watch notifications,
    and so on, and on mail-delivery failures due to wrong recipient addresses, these
    mails bounce back to the sender. |'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_TB
  zh: '| 电子邮件地址* | 用户的电子邮件地址。论坛可以配置为通过电子邮件请求注册确认，以便激活用户账户。如果需要此类确认，将发送一封电子邮件到本字段提供的地址。许多phpBB管理员选择通过电子邮件确认，以确保用户输入有效的电子邮件地址。这有一个很好的理由——如果你不要求电子邮件确认，而用户使用虚假的电子邮件地址注册，你将开始收到大量退回的邮件到你的管理员电子邮件地址。为什么会有这些退回的邮件？嗯，phpBB会使用你的账户（你将是发送者）发送电子邮件，用于私信通知、主题关注通知等，如果由于错误的收件人地址导致邮件投递失败，这些邮件会退回给发送者。|'

    note about the passwords: they are encrypted before they are saved to the database
    using the MD5 one-way encryption algorithm. In plain English: there’s no way for
    a saved password to be retrieved; at least the modern computer algorithms are
    not capable of doing it. This means that only the users know their passwords.
    If a user forgets a password, there’s a procedure to create a new password, but
    none to restore the old one. |'

    link to this post. It’s not very likely that someone would want to go to the post
    they are reading at the moment, but this can be very useful when you want to give
    a link to a specific post, as opposed to a link to the topic in general. To get
    the exact URL of a posting, right-click this miniature graphic and copy the URL
    that it links to. The graphic can also be different in color, which has a meaning.

    topics-listing page. This will make it a bit difficult to locate a specific older
    topic. phpBB’s search feature comes to the rescue here. It’s accessible through
    the **Search** top-navigation link. The search form gives you many options to
    find your topic of interest, such as which forum to search, how to display the
    results, and so on.

    searches. After all, we are so used to simple search boxes like Google’s, for
    example, that we rarely look for other options. But here is one simple option
    that can help you a lot. This option is **Search for all terms**. It helps when
    you search using more than one word. Unlike Google, where the results will be
    narrowed when you add more words, phpBB will search for each individual word and
    return more results (broadening the search as opposed to narrowing it).

    *outside* the public board area, through private messages (PM). (PM is also used
    as a verb, as in "Please PM me".) PMs work very similarly to the normal e-mail
    we’re all used to. The interface for writing a PM is the same as for writing a
    posting, only there is a field for the recipient’s username at the top. Also,
    you can look up a username if you’re not sure about the spelling.

    what *is* a moderator? All dictionary definitions aside, a moderator is a community
    member who has some more privileges over the postings and the topics than those
    that the regular users have. Moderators are usually respected veteran members
    who are volunteering their time and energy to make the forum a better place for
    discussions in line with the administrator’s vision for the community.

    Although its a probable scenario, its not necessarily always the case. Two users
    may have the same ISP (or may be employed at the same company) and thus may have
    the same IP address. Another explanation is that two users are friends and one
    is using the others computer and Internet connection to post. And yet another—two

    That’s why there is a powerful and options-rich system of permissions and user
    privileges. You’ll find some more detailed information about the permissions system
    in Chapter 5, which contains details on some advanced phpBB features. You’ll also
    find more information in the phpBB user guide. So before you start playing around
    with the permissions, make sure you know what you’re doing. For now, we’ll just
    take a quick look into the permissions that are used most often, and leave the
    details for later.

    Using the simple mode, you can pick permission patterns (a set of advanced permissions
    grouped together to be easier to use) from a list of preset values. Example options
    for simple mode are "Public" forum, "Registered" forum, and "Hidden" forum.'

    you know what you’re doing.'
  id: totrans-387
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The two simple mode options used the most frequently are "Registered" and "Public".
    To get a rough idea, in a "Public" forum, a visitor doesn’t have to be a registered
    user in order to post. In a "Registered" forum, only registered users can post.
    In both cases, only moderators and administrators can use more advanced features
    like specifying topic-type (sticky and announcement) or editing and deleting other
    people’s posts.

- en: While you can ban users after the damage is done, disallowing certain usernames
    is a preventative act. When a username (or a part of it) is disallowed, it cannot
    be used for registrations. So this feature is used before a username is taken,
    to prevent it from being taken. The form for disallowing usernames contains an
    interface for both adding and removing rules. The form is accessible through the
    **Disallow names** link on the left.

    or Admin is disallowed to prevent imposters from using usernames suggesting that
    they are not just regular users, but have special community powers.

- en: Running through the phpBB’s basic features was a long way to go. This is true,
    because phpBB is a feature-rich bulletin-board system that provides a lot of flexibility
    to all user types—regular members, moderators, and administrators. To get philosophical,
    in theory and practice, it is known that greater flexibility often comes at the
    price of increased complexity. But this is not necessarily the case for most of
    the phpBB features as they are really intuitive and easy to use.

    a pretty good idea how things are working around your new BB. If you didn’t do
    the practice parts, now is the time to go back and do them or just to set the
    book aside and jump into experimenting with phpBB, you favorite bulletin-board
    system.
