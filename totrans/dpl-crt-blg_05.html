Up until now we have focused on adding and organizing the site's basic functionality. We have not yet given any thought to how this functionality is to be accessed, or by whom. As the site grows, you will most likely feel the need to delegate certain responsibilities to various people. Alternatively, you might organize a team of people to work on specific aspects of the site. Whatever your needs, at some stage you will have to make decisions about who can do what, and the good people at Drupal have made sure that it is possible to do precisely this.</p><p>In the same vein as the previous chapter, having Drupal simplify the implementation of your access control policies does not mean that the task is a trivial one. There is still much thought that needs to go on behind the scenes in order to create a sophisticated, and above all, effective policy for controlling access to the site. Because of this, we will spend a bit of time exploring the ramifications of the various choices available, instead of simply listing them. Taking a holistic approach to your access control policy will ensure you don't end up with any nasty surprises down the line.</p><p>Since we have now been working with Drupal for a little while we will start spreading our wings a bit and use some slightly more advanced methods provided by contributed modules. Specifically, this chapter will look at the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Planning an access policy</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Roles</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Permissions—including the use of the<span class="emphasis"><em> Taxonomy Access Control</em></span> module</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Users</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Access rules</li></ul></div><p>Before we continue, it is worth pointing out that at the moment you are more than likely using the administrative user (user number 1) for all the site's development needs. That is absolutely fine, but once you have finished making any major changes to the site, you should begin using a normal administrative user that has only the permissions required to complete your day-to-day tasks. The next section will highlight the general philosophy behind user access, which should make the reason for this clear.</p><div class="section" title="Planning an Access Policy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec01"/>Planning an Access Policy</h1></div></div></div><p>When you think about how your site should work, you need to focus in on what will be required of yourself, other community members, or even anonymous users. In other words,<span class="emphasis"><em> will there be a team of moderators working to ensure that the content of the site conforms to the dictates of good taste and avoids material that is tantamount to hate speech and so on? Will there be subject experts who are allowed to create and maintain their own content? How much will anonymous visitors be allowed to become involved, or will they be forced to merely window shop without being able to contribute?</em></span>
<a class="indexterm" id="id152"/>
</p><p>Some of you might feel that you want the use of the site to grow organically with the community, and so you want to be extremely flexible in your approach. However, you can take it as given that your site and access policies are already flexible, given how easy it is to make changes in Drupal. This means that no one is exempt from building a proper access control plan to begin with. If you need to change it as time goes by, so be it, but at least there will be a coherent set of roles from the start.</p><p>So where do we begin? The first and foremost rule of security that can be applied directly to our situation is to:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"/>Note</h3><p>Grant a user permissions sufficient for completing the intended task, and no more!</p></div></div><p>Our entire approach is going to be governed by this rule. With a bit of thought you should be able to see why this is so important. Obviously, the last thing anyone wants is for an anonymous user to be able to modify the personal blog of a respected industry expert. This means that each type of user should have carefully controlled permissions that effectively block their ability to act outside the scope of their role.</p><p>One upshot of this is that you will find it better to create a larger number of specific roles rather than create a generic role or two, and allow everyone to use those catch-all permissions. Drupal gives us fine-grained control over what users can accomplish, and you should make good use of this facility. It may help to think of your access control using the following figure (this does not necessarily represent the actual roles on your site—it's just an example):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Planning an Access Policy" src="graphics/1800_05_01.jpg"/></div><p>The shaded region represents the total number of permissions available for the site. Contained within this set are the various roles that exist either by default, like the<span class="strong"><strong> Anonymous users</strong></span> role, or those you create in order to cater for the different types of users the site will require—in this case, the<span class="strong"><strong> Blog Writer users</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator users</strong></span> roles. Each role can then contain any number of users.<a class="indexterm" id="id153"/>
</p><p>From the previous diagram you can see that the<span class="strong"><strong> Anonymous users</strong></span> have the smallest set of permissions because they have the smallest area of the total diagram. This set of permissions is totally encapsulated by the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator users</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Blog Writer users</strong></span>—meaning that forum moderators and blog writers can do everything an anonymous user does, and a whole lot more.</p><p>Of course, the blog writers have a slightly different remit. While they share some common permissions with the forum administrators, they also have a few of their own. Your permissions as the primary or administrative user encompass the entire set, because there should be nothing that you cannot control.</p><p>It is up to you to decide on which roles are best for the site, but before you attempt this it is important to ask:<span class="emphasis"><em> What are roles and how are they used in the first place?</em></span> To answer this, let's take a look at the practical side of things in more detail.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Roles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec02"/>Roles</h1></div></div></div><p>It may seem a bit odd that we are not beginning our practical look at access control with a discussion on users. After all, it is all about what users<span class="emphasis"><em> can</em></span> and<span class="emphasis"><em> cannot</em></span> do! The problem with immediately talking about users is that the focus of a single user is too narrow, and we can learn far more about controlling access by taking a more broad view using roles. Once we have learned everything there is to know about roles, actually working with users becomes a trivial matter.</p><p>A user role, in Drupal, is akin to a character in a play. In a play, an actor must always be true to their character—in other words, there is a defined way to behave and the character never deviates (no matter which actor portrays the character), otherwise the illusion is broken. In the same way, Drupal allows defined roles that determine the behavior of a user. Creating a role in Drupal is very easy! Simply click the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> link under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> and select the<span class="strong"><strong> roles</strong></span> tab to bring up the following simple interface:<a class="indexterm" id="id154"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Roles" src="graphics/1800_05_02.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, we have two roles already defined by default—the<span class="strong"><strong> anonymous user</strong></span> and the<span class="strong"><strong> authenticated user</strong></span>. It is not possible to change these, and so the<span class="strong"><strong> Operations</strong></span> column is permanently set to<span class="strong"><strong> locked</strong></span>. To begin with, the anonymous user (this is any user who is browsing the site without logging in) has very few permissions set, and you would more than likely want to keep it this way despite the fact that it is possible to give them any and all permissions.</p><p>Similarly, the authenticated user, by default, has only a few more permissions than the anonymous user, and it is also sensible to keep these to a minimum. We will see in a little while how to go about deciding who should have which permissions.</p><p>In order to add a new role, simply type in a name for the role and click<span class="strong"><strong> Add role</strong></span>, and you're done!<span class="emphasis"><em> But what name do you want to add?</em></span> That's the question! If you are unsure about what name to use, then it is most likely you haven't clearly defined what purpose you want that role to serve. To see how this is done, let's assume that the<span class="emphasis"><em> Contechst Wildlife Community</em></span> requires a forum moderator who will be a normal user in every way except for the ability to work directly on<span class="strong"><strong> Conservation</strong></span> forums (to take some of the burden of responsibility off the administrator's hands) to create new topics and to edit the content if necessary.<a class="indexterm" id="id155"/>
</p><p>So, to get the ball rolling, we type in<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span> and click<span class="strong"><strong> Add role</strong></span>—actually, you might even want to be more specific and use something like<span class="strong"><strong> Conservation Forum Moderator user</strong></span> in this case, but you get the general idea. That's it! We have added the role successfully. Now, when you are presented with the<span class="strong"><strong> roles</strong></span> page you should be able to view the new role, with the option to edit it shown on the right-hand side of the page. You can click<span class="strong"><strong> edit</strong></span> in order to change the name of the role or delete it completely.</p><p>Our work is just beginning, because now we need to grant or deny the various permissions that the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span> role will need in order to successfully fulfill its purpose. New roles are not given any permissions at all to begin with—this makes sense if you think about it, because the last thing we want is to create a role only to find that it has the same permissions as the administrative user.<a class="indexterm" id="id156"/>
</p><p>The chances are you will need to add several roles depending on the needs of the site. For the moment, let's move on and take a look at how we flesh out this new role by setting permissions.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Permissions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec03"/>Permissions</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to work with permissions, click the<span class="strong"><strong> permissions</strong></span> tab on the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> page and you should be presented with a screen much like this (notice the new<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span> role on the right-hand side of the page):<a class="indexterm" id="id157"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Permissions" src="graphics/1800_05_03.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, this page lists all of the available permissions down the left-hand column and allows you to enable or disable that permission by checking or un-checking boxes in the relevant column. It is easy enough to see that one simply goes down the list selecting those permissions required to be given for each role. What is not so easy is actually determining what should and shouldn't be enabled in the first place.</p><p>Notice too that the permissions given in the list on the left-hand side pertain to specific modules. This means that if we change the site's setup by adding or removing modules, then we will also have to change the permissions on this page. What this means is that:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"/>Note</h3><p>Most times a module is added, you will need to ensure that the permissions are set as you require them for that module, because by default no permissions are granted.</p></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What else can we learn from the permissions page shown in the previous screenshot? Well, what does each permission precisely mean?</em></span> There are quite a few verbs that allow for completely different actions. The following lists the more common, generic ones although you might find one or two others crop up every now and then to cater for a specific module:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>administer:</strong></span> gives the user the ability to affect the function of a module. For example, granting administer rights to the locale module means that the user can add or remove languages, manage strings, and even export<code class="literal"> .po</code> files. This permission should only ever be given to trusted users, and never to anonymous users.<a class="indexterm" id="id158"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>access:</strong></span> gives the user the ability to make use of a module without being able to affect it in any way. For example, granting access rights to the comment module allows a user to view comments without being able to delete, edit, or reply to them.<a class="indexterm" id="id159"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>create:</strong></span> gives the user the ability to create content of some sort. For example granting rights to create stories allows users to do so, but does not also give them the ability to edit those stories.<a class="indexterm" id="id160"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>edit own:</strong></span> gives the user the ability to work with the content<span class="emphasis"><em> they have created</em></span>. For example, granting<span class="strong"><strong> edit own</strong></span> rights to the<span class="emphasis"><em> story</em></span> module means that the user can modify their own stories at will.<a class="indexterm" id="id161"/></li></ul></div><p>There are also other module-specific permissions available, and it is recommended that you play around and understand any new permission(s) you set—most are pretty self explanatory.</p><p>Now, as the permissions given to the default roles are pretty sparse, you will probably want to take a look at what those users can do at the same time as you work on any new roles. More than likely, you will want to allow anonymous users to access much of the site's content, without allowing them to modify it in any way. I'll leave those choices up to you. But how do we go about setting up the required permissions for the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user?</strong></span>
</p><p>If we look down the list of permissions shown on the<span class="strong"><strong> Permission</strong></span> page, we see the following forum-related options (at the moment, the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span> permissions are those in the outermost column):<a class="indexterm" id="id162"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Permissions" src="graphics/1800_05_04.jpg"/></div><p>Enabling these three options and then testing out what new powers are made available should quickly demonstrate that this is not quite what we want.</p><p>If you are wondering how to actually test this out, you will need to register a new user and assign them to the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span> role. The following section on<span class="emphasis"><em> Users</em></span> explains how to create new users and administer them properly, so if you are unsure as to how to do this, jump ahead quickly and check that out so that you have a new user to work with.</p><p>The following point might make your life a bit easier:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>Use two browsers to test out your site! The demo site's development machine has IE and Firefox. Keep one browser for the administrator and the other for anonymous or other users in order to test out changes. This will save you from having to log in and out whenever testing new permissions.</p></div></div><p>Assuming you are happy to test out the new permissions one way or another, you will find that the forum moderator can access and work with<span class="emphasis"><em> all of the forums</em></span>, and we want to confine this particular user to only the<span class="strong"><strong> Conservation-related</strong></span> topics. We need something more specific—perhaps<span class="emphasis"><em> in one of the other modules?</em></span>
</p><p>Looking over the remaining permissions we can see that there is an<span class="strong"><strong> administer nodes</strong></span> option— let's try that. Disable the<span class="strong"><strong> administer forums</strong></span> option and enable the<span class="strong"><strong> administer nodes</strong></span> option for the anonymous user before saving and logging out. You should now find that the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Administrator user</strong></span> can edit<span class="emphasis"><em> any posts</em></span> to the forum quite easily by selecting the<span class="strong"><strong> content</strong></span> link in the main menu.<span class="emphasis"><em> So, what's the problem?</em></span> Well, for a start this user can now also configure all the different types of content on the site, as well as edit any type of content including other people's blogs. This situation is worse than the first one!<a class="indexterm" id="id163"/>
</p><p>Oh dear, despite the fact that we have quite a bit of control over who does what at the moment, there is already an indication that there are some things that are not easily done without help from elsewhere. In order to complete this task we will need to make use of the<span class="emphasis"><em> Taxonomy Access Control</em></span> module that we downloaded and installed in the previous chapter, because the solution to the current problem lies in forcing Drupal to define users who can access and manipulate content based on its category.</p><div class="section" title="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec01"/>Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control</h2></div></div></div><p>Assuming you have this module enabled, head on over to the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> section under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> link (you will need to be logged in as the administrator again). You should notice that there is a new tab on this page entitled<span class="strong"><strong> category permissions</strong></span>. This page should contain a list of the available roles and the ability to edit their category permissions. Straight off the bat, however, it probably won't work because you need to enable the module first. If this is the case, the following link should be shown:<a class="indexterm" id="id164"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_05.jpg"/></div><p>They're the boss! Head on over to the<span class="strong"><strong> taxonomy_access</strong></span> page under<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span> and enable the module. Now when you view the<span class="strong"><strong> category permissions</strong></span> page in<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span>, you will see a list of the available roles, ready for you to work with. Click the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span> in this list to see the permissions for any and all types of categorized content (incidentally, don't worry if you are unsure about content taxonomy and categories as yet—all this will be discussed in the following few chapters), like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_06.jpg"/></div><p>There is a lot to think about here! Now there is a taxonomy access help page at<span class="strong"><strong> taxonomy_access</strong></span> under<span class="strong"><strong> help</strong></span> in the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> section, which you should read along with this. Let's take a quick look at all of these options in action as well.<a class="indexterm" id="id165"/>
</p><p>The first three column-options available are<span class="strong"><strong> View, Update</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Delete</strong></span>. These are fairly self explanatory and allow the user to view, work with, or remove content respectively. The next option,<span class="strong"><strong> Create</strong></span>, allows users to fix the specified term to a post.<span class="strong"><strong> List</strong></span> causes the specified term to be displayed on a posting's page, in a category list or even in the breadcrumb navigation. Ensure that you have<span class="strong"><strong> List</strong></span> enabled if you want that term to actually appear in, on, or around your pages—leaving it disabled could have some unexpected results.</p><p>The first three options have three settings to choose from:<a class="indexterm" id="id166"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Allow</strong></span> (A): Grants the user the associated permission for any given category</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Ignore</strong></span> (I): Effectively denies the user the associated permission but can be overridden by using other<span class="strong"><strong> Allow</strong></span> commands</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Deny</strong></span> (D): Denies the user the associated permission for any given category</li></ul></div><p>The second bullet in this list brings us to an important point concerning precedence:</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"/>Note</h3><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Deny</strong></span> directive takes precedence over<span class="strong"><strong> Allow!</strong></span>
</p></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Why is this important?</em></span> Think about what would happen if at some stage a posting is linked to several categories (this scenario is possible, and we will come across it later in the book). If permissions are set up such that a user has the<span class="strong"><strong> Allow</strong></span> directive set for a term in one<span class="emphasis"><em> vocabulary</em></span> (vocabulary, and other taxonomy-related terms are all discussed in detail in<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced Content"> Chapter 7</a> on<span class="emphasis"><em> Advanced Content)</em></span>, but<span class="strong"><strong> Deny</strong></span> set for that term in the other, then the<span class="strong"><strong> Deny</strong></span> directive takes precedence. This is why<span class="strong"><strong> Ignore</strong></span> is so important because it allows you to effectively deny a permission for a term in one category without affecting others.</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"/>Note</h3><p>Use<span class="strong"><strong> Deny</strong></span> only if you are sure that a given role will<span class="emphasis"><em> never</em></span> need access to that term.</p></div></div><p>The drop-down lists shown at the top of each vocabulary allow you to make generalized statements that influence the entire column. For example, you might want to allow a user to view all the terms in a vocabulary rather than have to change each and every setting manually. If this is the case, simply select<span class="strong"><strong> Allow all</strong></span> from the drop-down list and away you go. Below the drop-down list is the<span class="strong"><strong> Default</strong></span> option, which causes any new terms in that column to be automatically endowed with the permission you set here—if you are not sure what you want here, stick to<span class="strong"><strong> Ignore.</strong></span>
<a class="indexterm" id="id167"/>
</p><p>Now, if you attempted to access the forums using your<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator</strong></span> user with the default permissions set, you will more than likely be disappointed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_07.jpg"/></div><p>This is really to be expected (despite the fact that we know that the forums do exist) because by default the forum moderator has only<span class="strong"><strong> Ignore</strong></span> directives set. Set your page to look like the following, and ensure that your<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator</strong></span> user has permission to<span class="strong"><strong> create forum topics</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> edit own forum topics</strong></span> (set on the<span class="strong"><strong> permissions</strong></span> tab of the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> page):<a class="indexterm" id="id168"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_08.jpg"/></div><p>Clicking<span class="strong"><strong> Save category permissions</strong></span> captures these settings, and you can now try out the new permissions. Specifically, we need to check whether this user can perform the expected operations.<span class="emphasis"><em> What are the expected operations?</em></span> Given the settings, we want the user to be able to access only the<span class="strong"><strong> Commercial Fishing</strong></span> forum within the<span class="strong"><strong> Conservation</strong></span> container. The user should be able to post to this forum as well as edit any posts within this forum (even if they are not the user's own posts).<a class="indexterm" id="id169"/>
</p><p>Looking at the<span class="strong"><strong> Forums</strong></span> page from the perspective of the forum moderator, we get the following:<a class="indexterm" id="id170"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_09.jpg"/></div><p>This is perfect! The user can only access the one forum as expected, but the real test lies in whether we can edit someone else's posts. In this case, I used my administrator user to post a note to this forum, and accessing it via the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Administrator user</strong></span> brings up the following page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_10.jpg"/></div><p>From this you can see that the<span class="strong"><strong> List</strong></span> directive that was enabled is working correctly because the taxonomy term<span class="strong"><strong> Commercial Fishing</strong></span> is displayed. Obviously, the<span class="strong"><strong> View</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Update</strong></span> directives are working fine because we can see the post and can edit it. If you would like to confirm that the<span class="strong"><strong> Delete</strong></span> directive is working, simply click on<span class="strong"><strong> edit</strong></span> and check that the option to<span class="strong"><strong> Delete</strong></span> the post is available at the bottom of the page.</p><p>This is great news! Having tested the simplest case of granting permissions on a single forum, you now have to go back and set all the permission that will be needed. In doing so, it is likely that you will come across a few other interesting points. I will cover a couple of them here in detail—ultimately, you need to practice working with taxonomies and permissions to be able to achieve exactly what you want. I suggest waiting until we have covered taxonomies in more detail before diving in, though.</p><p>Go back to the<span class="strong"><strong> category permissions</strong></span> page for the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator</strong></span> user, disable all of the<span class="strong"><strong> Create</strong></span> directives, and save your settings. Now try post a new forum topic using the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum administrator</strong></span> user. You should be presented with a page like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_11.jpg"/></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What's the problem?</em></span>
<span class="strong"><strong> Submit</strong></span> this message and then go back to the forums to view it.<span class="emphasis"><em> Do you see the issue?</em></span> We have disabled<span class="strong"><strong> Create</strong></span>, so we are not given the option of specifying which term this post should be associated with. So, because we can only view the<span class="strong"><strong> Conservation</strong></span> container and the<span class="strong"><strong> Commercial Fishing</strong></span> forum, the new content is not available to us.<span class="emphasis"><em>"But we would ultimately allow the forum moderator to "View" all of the forum topics anyway"</em></span>, you might counter. This is true, and doing so would certainly make the post accessible, but it wouldn't help the forum moderator to actually post to the forum he or she is in charge of.<a class="indexterm" id="id171"/>
</p><p>This has hopefully demonstrated that choosing your settings is quite a subtle task. Re-enabling the<span class="strong"><strong> Create</strong></span> directive and attempting the post again brings up the following extra option, which then does the trick:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_12.jpg"/></div><p>Now when this content is submitted, it is correctly displayed in the<span class="strong"><strong> Commercial Fishing</strong></span> forum. We will leave taxonomy permissions there because we have yet to discuss taxonomy in any detail, and you will be able to practice more effectively once we have discussed the ins and outs of taxonomies. Some of you may be wondering, for example, how to post this note to<span class="emphasis"><em> all</em></span> the forums within the forum administrator's remit instead of<span class="emphasis"><em> one at a time—tasks</em></span> like this will be dealt with in<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced Content"> Chapter 7</a>.</p><p>Once you are happy that you can control the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span>, let's try something slightly different. Click the<span class="strong"><strong> permissions</strong></span> tab of the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> page under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> and ensure that your<span class="strong"><strong> anonymous user</strong></span> has all the available<span class="strong"><strong> forum module</strong></span> permissions selected. Save these changes and log out of Drupal. Now, you have already seen what these permissions do; the anonymous user, most likely, will be able to administer all the forums. Sure enough, the main menu shows us the link to go to the forums as well as a link to administer forums. Click on the bottom link, which leads to the administration page for the forums. You should notice something fairly odd, like this:<a class="indexterm" id="id172"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Setting Permissions with Taxonomy Access Control" src="graphics/1800_05_13.jpg"/></div><p>Hmm, that's strange because we know there are forums there. Let's try the other<span class="strong"><strong> forum</strong></span> link in the main menu. This time, following that link simply brings up a blank page. That's very odd, we have full administrative permissions on the forums, yet Drupal is acting like they don't exist.<span class="emphasis"><em> Can you figure out why?</em></span>

</p><p>As the administrator, remove the<span class="strong"><strong> forum module</strong></span> permissions for the<span class="strong"><strong> anonymous user</strong></span> in the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> section and save the settings. Now, click on the<span class="strong"><strong> category permissions</strong></span> tab and then select the<span class="strong"><strong> edit</strong></span> link for the<span class="strong"><strong> anonymous user</strong></span>. You will be presented with the same untouched settings page that we initially saw for the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span>. The answer should now be apparent. As the anonymous user has no permissions set here, we were effectively giving Drupal conflicting instructions by saying that this user is a forum administrator who is not allowed to access anything related to the taxonomy terms within the forums.</p><p>In our case, we would like anonymous users to be able to view all the content in the forums (although, if there were any topics you wanted to hide you could simply leave them unchecked) so we choose<span class="strong"><strong> Select all</strong></span> from the<span class="strong"><strong> List</strong></span> drop-down and<span class="strong"><strong> Allow all</strong></span> in the<span class="strong"><strong> View</strong></span> column drop-down and save the settings. Take a look at the results as the anonymous user. You should find that it is possible to view all the forums as expected, but you are required to login in order to post anything.<a class="indexterm" id="id174"/>
</p><p>This has exemplified the need to thoroughly test your site regularly so that unforeseen changes don't have disastrous effects. You may have asked yourself at some stage during the discussion on permissions:<span class="emphasis"><em> Can one user belong to several roles?</em></span> The follow-up question to this is of course<span class="emphasis"><em> What permissions does a user who belongs to more than one role receive?</em></span> In order to answer these very important questions, let us take a look at the next topic in our discussion.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec04"/>Users</h1></div></div></div><p>A single user account can be given as many or as few permissions as you like via the use of roles. Drupal users are not really anything unless they already have a role that defines the manner in which they can operate within the Drupal framework. Hence, we discussed roles first.<a class="indexterm" id="id175"/>
</p><p>Users can be created in two ways. The most common way is by registering on the site—if you haven't already, go ahead and register a new user on your site by clicking the<span class="strong"><strong> Create new account</strong></span> link on the homepage just to test things out for yourself. Remember to supply a valid email address otherwise you won't be able to sign in properly. This will create an authenticated user, with any and all permissions that have been assigned to the<span class="strong"><strong> authenticated user</strong></span> role.<a class="indexterm" id="id176"/>
</p><p>The second way is to use your administrative user to create a new user. In order to do this, log on as the administrative user and click on<span class="strong"><strong> users</strong></span> under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span>. Select the<span class="strong"><strong> add user</strong></span> tab and follow the instructions on that page—you will need to supply Drupal with usernames, email addresses, and passwords. Once you have a couple of users to play around with, it's time to begin working with them.</p><div class="section" title="Administering Users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec02"/>Administering Users</h2></div></div></div><p>As the site's administrator, you are given complete access to the other users' account information. By clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> edit</strong></span> link shown to the right of each user account (under the<span class="strong"><strong> Operations</strong></span> column heading) in the<span class="strong"><strong> users</strong></span> page under<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span>, you can make any changes you require to a given user.<a class="indexterm" id="id177"/>
</p><p>Now, we have already looked over this page briefly when we initially set up our administrative user in<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Setting Up the Development Environment"> Chapter 2</a>, but it is worth looking over it in slightly more depth now as it has an important setting that was not there the first time round. If you scroll down the page a bit, you will notice that you now have the option to stipulate which roles this user belongs to. At present the demo site's<span class="strong"><strong> Roles</strong></span> section looks like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Administering Users" src="graphics/1800_05_14.jpg"/></div><p>Reading the lines below the checkboxes in this screenshot, you can see that whenever you add a user to another role, the user obtains the combined permissions of these roles. So, that answers the questions we had in the earlier section on<span class="emphasis"><em> Permissions. But what's all the fuss about?</em></span> By knowing this, you should go about delegating roles in the following fashion:<a class="indexterm" id="id178"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Define the most basic user of the site by setting the<span class="strong"><strong> anonymous user</strong></span> permissions.</li><li class="listitem">Set permissions for a basic<span class="strong"><strong> authenticated user—most</strong></span> likely for people who have registered on your site.</li><li class="listitem">Create special roles by only adding the specific additional permissions that are required by that role, and no more. Don't re-assign permissions that the authenticated user already has.</li><li class="listitem">Create new users by combining whatever roles are required for their duties or needs.</li></ol></div><p>If you follow the steps above, you will be sure to always give the correct permissions to each role. This is because you are building up a user's permissions from the most basic to the most complex without having to assign every single permission each time. It should be obvious that a forum moderator would have all the permissions of an anonymous and authenticated user plus a few more. So, if you look back to the first diagram in the chapter you can see that, in this case, we would:<a class="indexterm" id="id179"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Define the<span class="strong"><strong> anonymous user</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> authenticated user</strong></span> role permissions—an authenticated user should have all the permissions of an anonymous user, plus whatever else is needed by your basic site user.</li><li class="listitem">Create new roles with only the additional permissions needed for both the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Moderator user</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Blog Writer user</strong></span> other than those given to the authenticated user</li><li class="listitem">Assign blog writers to the<span class="strong"><strong> Blog Writer user</strong></span> role (they are automatically given the permissions granted to an authenticated user), and do the same for forum moderators and their role.</li></ol></div><p>Other than using that strategy for assigning roles to users, the information in this section is pretty easy to intuit; so let's move on.</p></div><div class="section" title="Configuring Users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec03"/>Configuring Users</h2></div></div></div><p>This section really discusses how the site treats users rather than discussing what users can and cannot do. However, you will find that some of the information in this section is important for the look and feel of the site. Click on<span class="strong"><strong> settings</strong></span> under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> link and then click<span class="strong"><strong> users</strong></span>. You will be provided with set of options beginning with user registration settings as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id180"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Users" src="graphics/1800_05_15.jpg"/></div><p>You might want to consider which of the first three options to select quite carefully depending on how you envisage the site functioning. For example, you might wish to allow everyone to read and post comments to the forums, or do whatever, without needing to register first. If this is the case, then it is likely that the only people who would need to register are going to be performing some sort of administrative duties, in which case you would probably want to select the first option, or at least the third option.<a class="indexterm" id="id181"/>
</p><p>For the demo site's sake, the second option is fine as we would like to make it easy for as many people as possible to become involved in the community without allowing absolutely everyone to post content and potentially cause problems. A helpful message is also added to explain the registration process to potential users.</p><p>The next section on this page deals with the process of user email customization. There is an interesting facet to this however, in that Drupal makes certain variables available for use within the static text that is entered. Let's take a look at how to modify a line or so in order to get the feel for how this works.<a class="indexterm" id="id182"/>
</p><p>By way of example, we will change the<span class="strong"><strong> Subject of welcome e-mail</strong></span> text from:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Account details for %username at %site</strong></span> to a slightly sprightlier:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Congratulations %username, you have registered with the %site on %date!</strong></span>
</p><p>Nothing too complicated here! The keywords preceded by the<span class="strong"><strong> %</strong></span> sign are simply placeholders for other values, which are inserted into your email according to how they are set at that particular time. This gives you the ability to personalize your correspondence. In this case, the subject of the welcome email for a user registered as<span class="strong"><strong> David</strong></span> is now displayed as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id183"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Users" src="graphics/1800_05_16.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see, the<span class="strong"><strong> %username, %site</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> %date</strong></span> placeholders have been correctly changed to reflect the contents of the variables for that particular setup. There are settings available for several standard emails such as<span class="strong"><strong> password recovery</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> welcome (awaiting admin approval)</strong></span>. The defaults are of course fairly sensible and easy to change should you need to. Remember the placeholders that are available for each piece of text are mentioned below the text area so play around with them until you are comfortable with their usage.<a class="indexterm" id="id184"/>
</p><p>The final section deals with<span class="strong"><strong> Pictures</strong></span>. Now, if you wish to enable<span class="strong"><strong> Picture support</strong></span> for users, then select<span class="strong"><strong> Enabled</strong></span> from the list, provide a default picture if you want one, and click<span class="strong"><strong> Save configuration</strong></span> (the other settings are fairly self explanatory and sensible, and you can come back at any stage to change them if they are not suitable for you).<a class="indexterm" id="id185"/>
</p><p>Drupal will set up a<code class="literal"> pictures</code> folder to hold all of the pictures within the<code class="literal"> files</code> folder in your Drupal installation. Once everything is done, users will have a new section added to the<span class="strong"><strong> edit</strong></span> tab of their<span class="strong"><strong> my account</strong></span> page, like so:<a class="indexterm" id="id186"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Users" src="graphics/1800_05_17.jpg"/></div><p>When the picture has been successfully uploaded, it will appear on the<span class="strong"><strong> my account</strong></span> page, and with the user's blog and forum posts on the site.</p><p>If the image does not appear and you end up seeing a link, something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Users" src="graphics/1800_05_18.jpg"/></div><p>then you will need to ensure that you set the correct<span class="strong"><strong> upload module</strong></span> permissions on the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> page, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Users" src="graphics/1800_05_19.jpg"/></div><p>Remember that since the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Administrator</strong></span> user automatically receives all the permissions of the<span class="strong"><strong> authenticated</strong></span> user, it is not necessary to enable the<span class="strong"><strong> view uploaded files</strong></span> permission for the<span class="strong"><strong> Forum Administrator</strong></span> as this would be redundant and would make the purpose of your user less clear.</p><p>Allowing users to incorporate pictures into a site is a good way for people to be able to personalize their contributions, and also gives everyone something visual to associate posts with. This is a great way to foster a community, as it helps give different users an identity of sorts.</p><p>Editing the picture is easy! Simply modify it in the<span class="strong"><strong> Picture</strong></span> section of the user's edit page as shown here:<a class="indexterm" id="id187"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Configuring Users" src="graphics/1800_05_20.jpg"/></div><p>That is pretty much the end of the line for configuring users. There are still a few more things we need to discuss with regards to security before we can move on though.<a class="indexterm" id="id188"/>
</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Access Rules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec05"/>Access Rules</h1></div></div></div><p>So far it should seem like Drupal has things more or less covered when it comes to ensuring that it is possible to control who does what on the site. This is certainly the case, but there are a few more situations that we have not yet discussed, and may well end up affecting the site at some stage. For example,<span class="emphasis"><em> what happens if you find that there is a company that repeatedly spams your forums with advertisements and marketing information?</em></span> Or,<span class="emphasis"><em> what happens if you want only people from a certain company to access your site?</em></span>
</p><p>Problems of this nature can really be a thorn in your side. Access problems can even end up driving community members away—unless you have the ability to set access rules.</p><p>There are some techniques that can be used to set access rules via the<span class="strong"><strong> access rules</strong></span> tab on the<span class="strong"><strong> access control</strong></span> page under the<span class="strong"><strong> administer</strong></span> main menu item. To implement any access rules you will need to select the<span class="strong"><strong> add rule</strong></span> option, which brings up the following page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Access Rules" src="graphics/1800_05_21.jpg"/></div><p>From this you can see that I am in the process of making a rule that denies access based on an email address. Before we continue on this line, it is important to note that there are both<span class="strong"><strong> Allow</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Deny</strong></span> options available, and these will act based on a supplied<span class="strong"><strong> Username, E-mail</strong></span>, or<span class="strong"><strong> Host</strong></span> address given in the<span class="strong"><strong> Rule type</strong></span> section. The final option,<span class="strong"><strong> Mask</strong></span>, allows you to specify the actual name of the user or host to which the rule will apply.</p><p>In the above case, the email address<code class="literal">bad_user@contechst.com</code>  will have a<span class="strong"><strong> deny</strong></span> rule created after<span class="strong"><strong> Add rule</strong></span> has been clicked.</p><p>Go ahead and create a rule like this one, and once you are done you will see that the rule now appears under the<span class="strong"><strong> list</strong></span> tab. Now that there is a deny rule in place, how do we go about using it? The answer is that it is already being used. If someone tries to register with the email address supplied in the rule, they will be denied access. As it stands, this is probably not very helpful, because it is unlikely you will know ahead of time what specific email addresses to block.</p><p>In order to cater for the times when you aren't entirely sure of the specific address, there are two wildcard characters provided that can serve as generic strings or characters. Let's say that you wanted to ban someone who runs a small spamming business. Simply blocking their current email address is not really sufficient, because they can simply create another address and use that one to register with Drupal. If you know that the addresses come from one location, such as:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;some characters&gt;@irritating_spammer.com
</pre></div><p>You could use the<code class="literal"> %</code> character to match whatever characters are present before the<code class="literal"> @</code> sign, effectively stopping anyone from that email server from registering, like so:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">%@irritating_spammer.com
</pre></div><p>If you have a Hotmail account, or something similar, try blocking any address that ends in<code class="literal"> @hotmail.com</code> and then attempt to register an account on the site. You should find that Drupal presents you with the following message:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Access Rules" src="graphics/1800_05_22.jpg"/></div><p>A new problem rears its ugly head when it so happens that you don't want to allow Hotmail addresses on the site with the exception of a close personal friend who is traveling around the world and can only access a Hotmail address. In this case, you need to set an<span class="strong"><strong> Allow</strong></span> rule as well. If it so happens that the email address of the person is<code class="literal"> good_friend@hotmail.com</code>, then you could set the allow rule by selecting the appropriate options to cater for this on the<span class="strong"><strong> add rule</strong></span> page.</p><p>Your rules would then look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Access Rules" src="graphics/1800_05_23.jpg"/></div><p>What this does is ban all Hotmail addresses on the site. However, because<span class="emphasis"><em> an allow rule takes precedence over a deny rule</em></span>, the one and only Hotmail address specified in the single<span class="strong"><strong> allow</strong></span> rule shown in the screenshot will work fine. Now when your good friend attempts to register, everything will go swimmingly well.</p><p>After some time, you might find that the set of rules that are in place can become slightly confusing, or alternatively, it is simply not feasible to continue attempting to register new names all the time to ensure that they work according to plan. In this case, use the<span class="strong"><strong> check rules</strong></span> tab on the right-hand side of the<span class="strong"><strong> access rules</strong></span> page. This allows names of users, email addresses, and hosts to be entered in order to check whether they have access or not. Simply compare these results with your expectations to determine if everything is working as planned.</p><p>One final thing to bear in mind is that if you deny access using the host criteria, then this will be enforced throughout the site and not just on the registration pages. For the case of the spammer, you would probably want to deny access to the site in general; so you would select the<span class="strong"><strong> host</strong></span> option with something like this for the<span class="strong"><strong> Mask:</strong></span>
</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">%irritating_spammer%
</pre></div><p>This would then match to any host with<code class="literal"> irritating_spammer</code> in it. For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">www.really_irritating_spammer.com
www.mildly_irritating_spammer.com
www.extremelyirritating_spammer.org
www.unbelievably_irritating_spammer.comms.org.co.sz
</pre></div><p>and so on. Remember to check that all the rules you add have the desired affect on the site's access policy. It would be a shame to make a rule that prevented potentially valuable community members from accessing content, causing them to go elsewhere.</p><p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention, before finishing off, that there are a number of other<span class="strong"><strong> user access/authentication-related</strong></span> modules available on the Drupal website. It is probably worthwhile to check these out at<code class="literal"> http://drupal.org/project/Modules/category/74</code> in case there is something you find that is particularly suited to your needs.</p><p>Of special interest are the<span class="emphasis"><em> node privacy byrole</em></span> and<span class="emphasis"><em> Path Access</em></span> modules, which provide an alternative method of controlling access to content. Having seen how the<span class="emphasis"><em> Taxonomy Access</em></span> module worked, you should feel confident enough to work with any of these contributions assuming you are not able to achieve precisely what you want already.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec06"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter has given you a good grounding in the basics of controlling access to your site's content. You have seen that Drupal comes with a large number of facilities and options to ensure proper maintenance of the site by retaining overall control with the administrative user, as well as delegate important jobs to trusted users via the use of roles.</p><p>We looked at how to go about planning an access policy. This is not only an important requirement, in terms of making sure the site runs smoothly, but also helps to solidify how the site will eventually work by forcing you to consider many eventualities. Following this, a tour of the fundamental aspects of access control in Drupal saw us discussing roles, permissions, and users, and learning how to plan and implement an access policy based on the requirements of the site.</p><p>A discourse on how to use the contributed module that controls access based on taxonomy showed us how to implement even further fine-grained control over the content's access permissions. However, you probably also found out that creating a well-designed and coherent access policy takes a bit of time. Planning, and above all, testing, will help ensure that everything works as intended.</p><p>Access rules were then introduced as a further way of controlling who gets into the site, with a discussion on how to use the wildcard characters effectively. With that, we are done with access control although you are strongly urged to spend some time playing around with the various options until you are comfortable with being able to make changes and knowing their effects.</p><p>The next two chapters take an in-depth look at content—the beating heart of Drupal!</p></div></body></html>
