    WordPress themes from scratch. We will look at all of the fundamental knowledge

    focus on creating an awesome design; the chapter is more about explaining the

    be sort of an introductory project. We will see how to install and set up WordPress,
    so that you can have a fresh installation to work with. We will create a theme,
    but we'll be focusing more on the code and the overall look and style. We'll create
    files and folders, add PHP code, and related things. First, I want to get you
    familiarized with PHP code, and then we can add some simple style.

    WordPress. You may have your own server set up; if you don't, you can use something
    like AMPPS, which is what I'll be using. It gives you an Apache server, PHP, and
    MySQL all on your local machine. You could also use XAMPP, which is very similar,
    or WAMP; there's also MAMP for Mac. There are lot of different choices, but if
    you want to use AMPPS, you can go to [https://ampps.com/](https://ampps.com/)
    and download it. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and it is pretty
    easy to get set up.

    actually include in this file to make it dynamic. We can add `php language_attributes`,
    which is a function that will determine the language we want the theme to display.
    You probably want to make your title dynamic, or you want to add your site name;
    to do that, we can say `php` and use a function called `bloginfo`, as shown in
    the preceding code block. This is really useful because it has a bunch of things
    that you can get, such as the site name, the description, the character set, URLs,

    whatever it may be. Without specifying any restrictions, it''s going to get every
    post. So, the first thing we''ll do is check to see whether there are any posts.
    We''ll use an `if` statement for that, and then use the shorthand. We will use
    the syntax that will help us go quickly in and out of `php`. We''ll then use `if(have_posts)`

    here, so that if there are no posts, then we just want to let the user know that.
    Now, instead of just spitting out text, we''ll use a function. We''ll say echo

    makes them into paragraphs. It''s a good function to use when you just want to

    as a syntax is concerned. I''ve never really seen this anywhere else apart from
    WordPress, but just know that you need to have this as well. Then, we''ll use
