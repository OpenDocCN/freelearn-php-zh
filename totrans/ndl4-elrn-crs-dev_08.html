			<h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor467"/>Chapter 6</em>: Adding Assignments, Lessons, Feedback, and Choice</h1>
			<p>Course activities enable learners to interact with the instructor, the learning system, or each other. They also allow learners to develop confidence by being rewarded with a badge or certificate when they complete the activities. Above all, course activities should connect to the learning objectives of the course and correspond to the appropriate level of knowledge in the cognitive domain, as indicated in Bloom's Taxonomy, which we reviewed in <a href="B17288_04_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">,<a id="_idTextAnchor468"/><a id="_idTextAnchor469"/><a id="_idTextAnchor470"/><a id="_idTextAnchor471"/> Managing Resources, Activities, and Conditional Access</em>. Your instructional strategy will be very effective if you ensure that every step of your course planning integrates the learning objectives with the appropriate level of content and activities, as well as that each step has measurable outcomes. Your institution may have to undergo periodic reviews of its curriculum, instructional strategy, instructional delivery system (learning management system), materials, and assessments to maintain its accreditation or certification status. In addition to developing effective course content and assessments, this chapter will help you engage learners and allow them to persist in their studies to achieve their learning goals.  </p>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we learned how to add resources, or static course material, such as web pages, links, and media. We saw that all activities are added from the <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> menu after we select the <strong class="bold">Turn editing on</strong> option. In this chapter, we'll provide an overview of all the activities, and then take a closer look at <strong class="bold">assignments</strong>, <strong class="bold">lessons</strong>, <strong class="bold">feedback</strong>, and <strong class="bold">choices</strong>. We are starting with those activities because they often form the foundation of courses. </p>
			<p>In addition, we will review how Bloom's Taxonomy helps you align your learning objectives with measurable assessments, as well as how to apply this knowledge for institutional accreditation and licensing requirements.</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instructional strategies</li>
				<li>Learning objectives</li>
				<li>Competency and mastery learning definitions</li>
				<li>Definitions</li>
				<li>Understanding assignments</li>
				<li>Setting up lessons</li>
				<li>Developing Feedback Modules</li>
				<li>Exploring Choice</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we go through this chapter, we will learn how to add several kinds of interactive course material: assignments, lessons, choices, and feedback. We will also discuss how to organize the content to build micro-competencies, and then to affirm micro-learning milestones and generate certificates (which are installed separately) and badges.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to build course content that provides instructional material, while also motivating the learner with engagers by giving feedback and indicating where they are on the path to achieving the learning outcomes. You'll also be able to develop badges and certificates that encourage learners to persist and complete the course. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor472"/><a id="_idTextAnchor473"/><a id="_idTextAnchor474"/>Instructional strategy</h1>
			<p>We discussed instructional strategies earlier in this book, and we did so in a global sense. Now, we will look at how the <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>instructional strategy plays itself out as you start applying the principles and having students do things (activities). </p>
			<p>Your <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>instructional strategy involves mapping out how you'll achieve learning outcomes by strategically placing instructional material, engagers, lessons, assessments, feedback, and shareable evidence of mastery, such as certificates and badges. Another way to think of it is that your instructional strategy is how you map your learning objectives to your course materials, activities, and assessments, as well as how you keep your learners excited about learning along the way and how you reward them when they complete the module or course.</p>
			<p>As you start to organize the course, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Review the overall goals of your course.</li>
				<li>Review the learning objectives.</li>
				<li>Describe how you will measure the outcomes.</li>
				<li>Review the activities that connect to the learning outcomes and the course content.</li>
				<li>Review the activities that are most appropriate for your learners.</li>
				<li>Determine how you would like to best motivate your learners by developing badges.</li>
				<li>Determine whether or not your institution requires you to align with competency frameworks. This is particularly vital if you seek accreditation or approval to offer certificates. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Following these steps will help you organize your assignments and also create a templa<a id="_idTextAnchor475"/>te that you can use for your other courses.</p>
			<p>As you prepare for accreditation reviews, be sure that your instructional strategy is consistent across the institution. This means that your levels of difficulty and the types of instructional material should be consistent. Furthermore, when it comes to the assessments themselves, be sure that they not only align with Bloom's Taxonomy, but also reflect the vision and mission of the institution. </p>
			<p>Your instructional strategy should be anchored by learning objectives. In the next section, we will review how to use and write learning objectives.<a id="_idTextAnchor476"/> </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor477"/>Learning objectives</h1>
			<p>We mentioned learning objectives<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> at a high level earlier in this book. Now, we will look at how to apply the concept as we focus on activities. The learning objectives you select should clearly and concisely express the performative outcomes of your course. They will appear in the syllabus as well. Keep in mind that effective learning objectives use action verbs that tie to Bloom's Taxonomy, and they result in actions that are measurable and tie directly to the course unit or the entire course. Bloom's Taxonomy is arranged as a hierarchy, with the more fundamental outcomes such as <strong class="bold">Identify forming</strong> at the base and more complex and abstract ones such as <strong class="bold">Create</strong> at the top. Think of the different levels of the hierarchy as building blocks.</p>
			<p>You can use the following process to write learning objectives:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Identify what you want the learner to be able to do.</li>
				<li>Identify the level of knowledge of Bloom's Taxonomy.</li>
				<li>Select a verb that ties to a measurable, observable action.</li>
				<li>Add criteria to refine the outcome so that it has qualitative or quantitative specific<a id="_idTextAnchor478"/>s.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's review Bloom's Taxonomy. As you may recall, Bloom's Taxonomy was developed as a building-block sequence of ever-increasing levels of complexity. Simply put, it is a hierarchy that helps you describe, map, and measure knowledge in the cognitive domain.</p>
			<p>We'll start with the<a id="_idIndexMarker413"/> learning objectives. Bloom's Taxonomy is a pyramid; the base is the<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> most foundational, and it has to do with remembering. So, we can start with learning objectives that have to do with remembering. For example, we can say, <strong class="source-inline">Identify five places in the world that use geothermal energy</strong>.</p>
			<p>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.1</em>, we move up from the base of the pyramid to tasks of increasing complexity. Each task has affiliated verbs, which will make assessing and determining whether or not an individual achieved the learning objective much easier.</p>
			<p>The top of the pyramid is <strong class="bold">CREATING</strong>. It is at the pinnacle of the hierarchy because it brings together the lower-domain cognitive activities and requires both synthesis and analysis. The <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>learning objective for a course that will ascend as high as the sixth level will be easier than it may <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>seem at first. The key is to consider an activity that will allow you, as the instructor, to properly evaluate or assess. For example, creating the corresponding activity could be to "develop a project" or "invent a new type of magazine":</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Bloom's Taxonomy's pyramid shape contains the most basic verbs, which measure the cognitive domain, the base, and the most complex at the pinnacle</p>
			<p>Now that we have reviewed the learning objectives and the functionality of Bloom's Taxonomy as a starting point in developing an instructional strategy, we will learn about using a competency learning or mastery learning strat<a id="_idTextAnchor479"/><a id="_idTextAnchor480"/><a id="_idTextAnchor481"/>egy. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor482"/>Competency learning definitions</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Competency learning</strong> (often referred to <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>as <strong class="bold">mastery learning</strong>) is an approach to learning that sets out a <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>set of criteria that are learning outcomes that correspond to a course, as well as to the outcomes of a program. A competency framework can be imported into Moodle. </p>
			<p>Competency learning is often required by regulatory agencies or governing bodies to ensure consistency in schools and learning organizations. When that is the case, there is a special emphasis on assessments. Many times, they are standardized tests rather than essay tests or demonstration projects. Great care is taken in assuring that the exams are psychometrically valid since completing the exam means that a person has demonstrated competence or even mastery of the concepts. </p>
			<p>Competency learning <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>uses the course outcomes (which tie to Bloom's Taxonomy) as the foundation for the course material and, above all, the standardized test. </p>
			<p>External affirmation of the competency having been achieved can appear in the form of badges that are generated upon completing an activity. They ca<a id="_idTextAnchor483"/>n also be achieved by a report that is generated directly in Moodle within a competency framework.</p>
			<p>Now that we have examined the different ways in which you can demonstrate mastery or competency concerning knowledge or skill, let's learn how to build assignments that will tie to the learning ou<a id="_idTextAnchor484"/>tcomes. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor485"/>Moodle activities</h1>
			<p>Moodle 4.0 has dramatically changed the available icons and has enhanced the functionality of its activities so that they connect more closely to the dashboard and activity logs, as well as having more functionality with the mobile app. In the previous chapter, we looked at resources, as well as a few activities that can deliver course content because they deliver bundles of content, including interactive material. In Moodle, an activity is something that has an element that learners can interact with. Activities are used to deliver content in a certain sequence, to assess the learner's progress, and to keep the learner interested and engaged. </p>
			<p>The following table <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>contains a list of all the Moodle activities, which can serve as a "one-stop-shop" reference point as you build your course. Since activities are at the heart of your course, you'll need to select the activities well and make sure they align with your course goals and learning objectives.</p>
			<p>You'll also want to keep Bloom's Taxonomy in mind. Note that the following table contains a thumbnail of the new icons for Moodle 4.0, as well as a brief description of each activity. Next to that, we have provided the advantages and disadvantages of each, along with a column that lists their common uses (which are also included in the description, advantages, and disadvantages). </p>
			<p>Activities <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>in Moodle 4.0 have been streamlined and expanded, which makes them easier to use. Some of the functionality has changed, which also streamlines them. For example, if you're used to using Moodle 3.11 (or earlier) in MoodleCloud, you'll notice that three activities no longer appear. <strong class="bold">Attendance</strong>, <strong class="bold">Checklist,</strong> and <strong class="bold">Custom Certificate</strong> are gone. Don't worry! That doesn't mean that you can't figure out who has attended the course. You can find out in the activity log if you use a <strong class="bold">Lesson</strong>. As for <strong class="bold">Checklist</strong>, all the required activities and due dates will now automatically appear in the dashboard, which will integrate everything that has a deadline into the calendar. If you wish you could automatically generate certificates and you miss the <strong class="bold">Custom Certificate</strong> activity that was included in MoodleCloud's paid packages, don't worry. Moodle 4.0 has updated the <strong class="bold">Badge</strong> plugin, which makes it much easier to generate badges that can be displayed on your website, LinkedIn page, social media, and more. </p>
			<p>Let's review Moodle's activities now and take a close look at each one. We will start by looking at commonly used activities:</p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Commonly used activities </p>
			<p>Moodle has a number of<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> activities that emphasize interactive communication and collaboration. Some emphasize interactive communication and others are easily incorporated into graded activities that can be used for assessment. The following table provides an overview of those activities: </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – Collaboration-focused activities </p>
			<p>Moodle has a few apps<a id="_idIndexMarker423"/> that focus on gathering feedback from users. In addition, Moodle also makes it possible to import content in different preprepared packages. The following table provides an overview of those activities: </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Tools to assist importing packages and obtaining feedback</p>
			<p>Now that we have reviewed the functionality of the activities, along with their uses and the advantages and disadvantages for using them, let's look at how to add activities. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor486"/>Adding an activity</h1>
			<p>Adding one activity is the same as adding any other activity, so let's go through this now. We'll address what all the activities have in common in this section as well. </p>
			<p>Let's consider a course called <em class="italic">Dog Grooming for Everyone</em>. Once we've created the course and identified its topics, we can add activities. </p>
			<p>As always, let's start by turning on <strong class="bold">Edit mode</strong> in the top right-hand corner: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer137" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.05_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – Turning on Edit mode&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – Turning on Edit mode</p>
			<p>Now, let's take a look at the topics. Click on <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> and then select one from the menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer138" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Modifying the topics to customize their content</p>
			<p>When you click on <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong>, the respective menu will pop up. I've selected <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> so that I only see activities. If you forget what each activity is about, you can click the little <strong class="bold">i</strong> icon for more information. Note that it only provides information and does not include the advantages or disadvantages, or common uses, that are shown in the handy "one-stop-shop" table: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer139" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.07_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – The menu of activities. &quot;i&quot; stands for information&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – The menu of activities. "i" stands for information</p>
			<p>Now that we have provided an overview of all the activities, let's learn how to select one and build it. Let's start with Moodle's Assignment activity. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor487"/>Selecting assignments</h1>
			<p>If you want<a id="_idIndexMarker424"/> the learner to do or create something and then grade the results, you will want an assignment. Keep in mind that if you are developing a blended course that contains synchronous content in the form of web conferences (BigBlueButton, Teams, or Zoom, for example), you may wish to put together assignments that can be done in conjunction with that "live" lecture. They may involve collaboration and group solutions. For peer review, use the Workshop activity. </p>
			<p>Let's start with the Assignments activity in Moodle, which will give us a chance to bring together several activities to create an assessment strategy. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113">Un<a id="_idTextAnchor488"/><a id="_idTextAnchor489"/><a id="_idTextAnchor490"/>derstanding assignments in Moodle</h1>
			<p>If you would like your learner to demonstrate that they have achieved mastery of a skill set or a body of knowledge, you will need to develop a way of assessing it. One good approach is to develop an assignment. The Assignment activity in Moodle gives you space to check the learner's knowledge using a quiz, allow the learner to practice until they achieve the passing score, and show they have achieved the learning objective.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114">Ad<a id="_idTextAnchor491"/>ding an assignment</h2>
			<p>Let's start by <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>creating an assignment. We can do that by clicking <strong class="bold">Adding an assignment</strong> and then selecting <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> from the menu that includes the full list of Moodle activities. In this case, we will be adding the assignment to the <em class="italic">Dog Grooming for Everyone</em> course. We will name the assignment <em class="italic">Review of Dog Grooming Tools</em>. </p>
			<p>This is where you can add the description of the assignment and also the assignment's instructions. Notice that the verb aligns with Bloom's Taxonomy and is measurable. In this case, the verb is "explain."</p>
			<p>As you add your description, you can include a graphic to illustrate it. Please keep in mind that Moodle is powerful and incredibly flexible. We are addressing basic skills here and are not getting into some of the more complex ways to customize it: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer140" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.08_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – Adding a name, description, activity instructions, and additional files&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – Adding a name, description, activity instructions, and additional files</p>
			<p>Once you have added the<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> assignment, you'll need to customize it. You can do so by clicking on <strong class="bold">Settings</strong>, which allows you to edit the assignment. It will indicate that you are <strong class="bold">updating the assignment in Dog Grooming Tools</strong>. A screen will open containing a list of topics that expand when you click on them. Each will allow you to modify aspects of your assignment  Keep in mind that this general approach is uniform across Moodle 4.0, so once you feel comfortable with it when creating an assignment, you'll feel comfortable with it in the other activities too: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer141" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.09_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9 – Menu of options for the Assignment activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor492"/><a id="_idTextAnchor493"/>Figure 6.9 – Menu of options for the Assignment activity</p>
			<p>As you look at your<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> course design document or storyboard, and you match the assignment with the learning objective and the level of Bloom's Taxonomy, you'll find that assignments are very good at the middle to higher levels of the Taxonomy. For example, you may ask a learner to write a paper that explains when, how, and where each dog grooming tool is used. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor494"/>Requirements of the assignments</h2>
			<p>In our case, we're going to<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> ask a learner to write a paper that explains when, how, and where to use dog grooming tools. However, we could also ask the learner to submit images of each or explain through a video presentation. In short, in an assignment, you can require the learners to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Submit one or more digital files.</li>
				<li>Write something.</li>
				<li>Do something outside of Moodle.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor495"/>Availability</h2>
			<p>An aspect of <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>understanding assignments involves being able to make assignments available to learners. Being able to make assignments available upon mastery can be very motivating, and it can also help you to avoid the trap of overwhelming learners with content they're not ready for. A key to learner success is keeping on track and making progress in the course. How you make assignments available can help motivate learners by clarifying the workflow and helping them manage their time so that they succeed. So, the <strong class="bold">Availability</strong> setting can be the cornerstone of your approach to helping learners develop a clear approach to not only maintaining awareness of what they should be doing but also prioritizing tasks:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer142" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.10_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10 – The Availability settings screen &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – The Availability settings screen </p>
			<p>You can use <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>the <strong class="bold">Availability</strong> setting to set limits for when the learner can submit work.</p>
			<p>Do not confuse this with the <strong class="bold">Allow access</strong> settings under <strong class="bold">Restrict access</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Allow access</strong> settings determine whether the learner can see the assignment on the course page, or whether the assignment is completely hidden from the learner. After the learner sees and selects the assignment, the <strong class="bold">Availability</strong> setting determines whether the learner can submit work to the teacher.</p>
			<p>Note that there is a <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> and a <strong class="bold">Cut-off date</strong>. If you do not enable a <strong class="bold">Cut-off date</strong>, the assignment will stop accepting work on the due date. If you enable and enter a <strong class="bold">Cut-off date</strong>, the assignment will accept work between the due date and the cut-off date. That work will be marked as late.</p>
			<p>When a learner clicks on an assignment, Moodle displays the assignment's description. You usually use the description to tell the learner how to complete the assignment. If you enable the <strong class="bold">Always show description</strong> setting, if a learner enters the assignment at any time, the learner will see the description. If you want a learner to be able to prepare and work ahead, this is fine. If you disable the <strong class="bold">Always show description</strong> setting, if a learner enters the assignment before the <strong class="bold">Allow submissions from</strong> date, Moodle will hide the description for the assignment. You can use this feature to prevent learners from working ahead.</p>
			<p>Assignments that are due soon will appear in the <strong class="bold">Upcoming events</strong> block. If you do not set a <strong class="bold">Due date</strong>, by default, it will be set to today (the day you created the assignment). This will make the assignment show up in the <strong class="bold">Upcoming events</strong> block as if it's overdue. Ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> that you set an appropriate <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> for the assignment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor496"/>Submission types</h2>
			<p>As we start to<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> think about the kind of paper or presentation we'd like our learners to do, let's take a moment to think about the kinds of submission types that are available under <strong class="bold">Assignments</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer143" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.11_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – The Submission types settings screen &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – The Submission types settings screen </p>
			<p>Notice that you can ask people to type into a text box (<strong class="bold">Online text</strong>) or you can enable <strong class="bold">File submissions</strong>.<a id="_idTextAnchor497"/><a id="_idTextAnchor498"/><a id="_idTextAnchor499"/> </p>
			<h3>Submitting a digital ﬁle</h3>
			<p>Anything<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> that can be uploaded on a computer can be uploaded into an assignment. However, Moodle will enforce its limit on the size of uploaded files. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as you plan your course. For example, if you require your learners to create a digital photograph, this option may work well.</p>
			<p>Remember that a Moodle site is configured with a limit on the size of files that can be uploaded into Moodle. If you require your learners to create a video, you may need to find another way for them to send you their large video files. You can ask learners to submit digital files uploaded to the cloud (Google, Dropbox, and so on), or you can ask them to create audio or video using a platform you can link to that the institution provides, such as Zoom or Teams, and then view the video or listen to the audio from that platform. Another option is for them to create a video and then upload it to their account on <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>YouTube, and then link to <a id="_idTextAnchor500"/><a id="_idTextAnchor501"/>it. This is a good time to mention that antivirus software may make the upload fail. Be sure to check with the site administrator to ensure that everything is configured to avoid being blocke<a id="_idTextAnchor502"/>d. </p>
			<h3>Requiring learners to submit online text</h3>
			<p>In an <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>online text assignment, you will require the learner to enter text into an online text editor. This text editor is part of the assignment activity.</p>
			<p>If learners are more comfortable writing the text in a word processor, they can copy and paste it into the text edi<a id="_idTextAnchor503"/>tor.</p>
			<p>You cannot paste graphics into Moodle's online text editor. Each graphic must be uploaded and placed into the document using the text editor's <strong class="bold">Insert or edit image</strong> icon. Alternatively, instead of copying and pasting into the text box, you can click the <strong class="bold">Manage Files</strong> icon to submit a file, so that the graphics can be upl<a id="_idTextAnchor504"/>oaded as separate files. The advantage of this approach is that you can easily make comments and provide feedback in the b<a id="_idTextAnchor505"/>ox. </p>
			<h3>Submitting work done in the real world by taking advantage of Zoom</h3>
			<p>Let's look at a <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>way to use Moodle to track learning "in real life." You can use an assignment to require learners to tell you that they have completed an activity outside of Moodle. For example, you can instruct your art learners to build an outdoor sculpture. Then, their submission will consist of notifying you, <strong class="bold">It's built and ready for you to review</strong>.</p>
			<p>Another approach would be for them to take a photo and then create a blog post that incorporates the textual part of their project, as well as photos. Here is an example that was posted on an account on <em class="italic">Blogger</em>: <a href="http://fringejournal.blogspot.com/2018/04/installation-1-i-heard-voices-of-angels.html">http://fringejournal.blogspot.com/2018/04/installation-1-i-heard-voices-of-angels.html</a>. </p>
			<p>If learners worked in teams (virtual or in person) on the projects, they can then record their experiences by starting a Zoom session where they take turns discussing their experience and then sharing their screen, where they can include photos, PowerPoint presentations, or screenshots. The <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>key to this type of real-world project is to have a Zoom meeting that is recorded. Then, the MP4 video file can be downloaded and saved, and the video can be shared within Zoom i<a id="_idTextAnchor506"/><a id="_idTextAnchor507"/><a id="_idTextAnchor508"/><a id="_idTextAnchor509"/>t<a id="_idTextAnchor510"/>self. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor511"/>Grading an assignment</h2>
			<p>This section <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>shows the flexibility that Moodle offers in terms of grading assignments and how to make it more effective for providing specific feedback and timely responses that will motivate learners. </p>
			<p>In the previous section, you learned how a learner submits an assignment. When assignments need to be graded, Moodle will notify the teacher by displaying a message on the teacher's <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong>. They can then open the assignment and grade it. The submitted assignment can be opened for grading and providing fe<a id="_idTextAnchor512"/>edback.</p>
			<p>The assignment can also be configured to send an automated email to each teacher to alert them of the submitted assignments.</p>
			<p>Moodle does not supply a link directly to the assignments that need grading but does supply a link to the course. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">The system administrator can configure Moodle so that when a user logs in, they are automatically taken to the user's <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong> page. This can be done in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> | <strong class="bold">Navigation</strong>, and by selecting <strong class="bold">My home</strong> as the default home page.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Grading</strong> page for the assignment enables the teacher to open all the submissions and enter a grade for each submission:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer144" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.12_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12 – The grading summary shows the instructor the status of the learners' work&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – The grading summary shows the instructor the status of the learners<a id="_idTextAnchor513"/>' work</p>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>you create the assignment, you can enable feedback comments and feedback files. If you do that, the teacher will be able to enter the comments and files while grading the ass<a id="_idTextAnchor514"/><a id="_idTextAnchor515"/><a id="_idTextAnchor516"/><a id="_idTextAnchor517"/><a id="_idTextAnchor518"/><a id="_idTextAnchor519"/><a id="_idTextAnchor520"/>i<a id="_idTextAnchor521"/><a id="_idTextAnchor522"/>gnment.</p>
			<h3>Feedback types</h3>
			<p>Even though feedback<a id="_idIndexMarker440"/> is given after assignments have been turned in, you must anticipate what kind of feedback is to be given. This is generally done when you set up availability because you're not only setting the parameters for the availability of the instructional material and assessments, but you're also setting up how the learners will receive feedback. </p>
			<p>In the preceding example, the learner received not only a grade but also additional feedback from the teacher. The feedback was in the form of comments that the teacher wrote, and also a file that the teacher uploaded. The instructor can give feedback comments, annotate a PDF, and upload Feedback files. You can also check the box to enable an Offline grading worksheet. This is enabled under the <strong class="bold">Feedback types</strong> setting:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer145" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.13_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – Feedback types settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – Feedback types settings</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Offline grading worksheet</strong> option <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>allows the teacher to download a <strong class="bold">comma-separated file</strong> (a <strong class="source-inline">.csv</strong> file) that contains a list of all the assignments and a place for the teacher to enter grades. However, downloading the grading worksheet does not download the material that the learners submitted. If the teacher wants to see the submissions offline, they must download them separately.</p>
			<p>If offline grading is enabled, when the teacher clicks on <strong class="bold">Submissions</strong> there will be a dropdown menu, <strong class="bold">Grading action</strong>. You will have all the options, including the teacher will see the <strong class="bold">Download grading worksheet</strong> option in the grading page for the assignment as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.12</em>. The path is <strong class="bold">Course Name | Assignment name | View all submissions | Grading action</strong>.</p>

			<h3>Submission settings</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Submission settings</strong> determines <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>how Moodle behaves while the learner is submitting their work:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer147" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.15_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.15 – Submission settings &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15 – Submission settings </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Require students to click the submit button</strong> setting determines whether the learner <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>must submit the assignment all at once or whether the learner can save their submission as a draft and submit it later. If you select <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> for this setting, when the learner is creating a submission, Moodle will display a <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button. After the learner saves the submission, when the learner enters the assignment, they will have the option to either edit what was saved or submit it.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Require that students accept the submission statement</strong> setting determines whether Moodle displays a statement that the work belongs to the lear<a id="_idTextAnchor526"/>ner. You can add automatic feedback upon submission to require the student to assure academic honesty. Note that this is a sitewide setting. The navigation path is <strong class="bold">Site administration | Plugins | Activity modules | Assignment | Assignment settings</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer148" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.16_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.16 – Requiring learners to accept a submission statement, which can include a statement of academic honesty &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16 – Requiring learners to accept a submission statement, which can include a statement of academic honesty </p>
			<p>In the <em class="italic">Allowing learners to change their minds section</em>, we saw what it looks like for the learner when the teacher reopens an assignment. The <strong class="bold">Additional attempts</strong> setting determines whether, and how, the teacher can allow a learner to resubmit the assignment. Note that a resubmission replaces the original submission.</p>
			<p>Selecting <strong class="bold">Never</strong> means<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> the teacher cannot reopen the assignment to allow the learner to resubmit their work. <strong class="bold">Manually</strong> means that the teacher can reopen the assignment.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Automatically until pass</strong> means that the assignment will remain open until the learner achieves a passing grade – that is, if the teacher gives the learner less than a passing grade for the learner's submission, Moodle will automatically enable the learner to resubmit.</p>
			<p>To use <strong class="bold">Automatically until pass</strong>, you must set a passing grade for the assignment: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer149" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.17_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.17 – Editing Grade to set a passing grade for the assignment &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.17 – Editing Grade to set a passing grade for the assignment </p>
			<p>Then, select<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> the <em class="italic">Edit</em> icon (the one shaped like a gear) for the assignment. That will bring you to a page where you can enter a passing grade for the assi<a id="_idTextAnchor527"/><a id="_idTextAnchor528"/><a id="_idTextAnchor529"/><a id="_idTextAnchor530"/>gnment.</p>
			<h3>Group submission settings</h3>
			<p>Moodle allows you to assign<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> the learners and teachers in a class to different groups.</p>
			<p>For more about groups, please refer to <a href="B17288_11_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1042"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Groups and Cohorts</em>.</p>
			<p>In an assignment, setting <strong class="bold">Learners submit in groups</strong> to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> means that each group the teacher created will submit their work together as a group and that all the members of a group will receive the same grade.</p>
			<p>If you set <strong class="bold">Require all group members submit</strong> to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, every member of a group will need to click on the <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> button to finalize a submission. If you set this to <strong class="bold">No</strong>, any member of a group can submit the assignment for the whole group. However, even though only one member of the group may have submitted the assignment, the feedback and<a id="_idTextAnchor531"/> grade are applied<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> to all members of the group.</p>
			<h3>Notifications</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Notifications</strong> settings<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> determine whether the graders will receive messages when a learner (or group) submits an assignment.</p>
			<p>Each user in Moodle can choose how they want to receive messages. This is done under <strong class="bold">Preferences | User account | Message preferences</strong>.</p>
			<p>Then one can restrict to contacts and also indicate email preference.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer150" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.18_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.18 – Configuring how to receive messages&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18 – Configuring how to receive messages</p>
			<p>If your email<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> application allows you to filter emails based on their subject line and sender, you can use that feature to automatically put all the notices about assignment submissions into a specific folder.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Email alerts are especially useful in courses where you allow learners to proceed at their own pace since you won't know what activities they have completed unless you check the course and look at the g<a id="_idTextAnchor532"/><a id="_idTextAnchor533"/><a id="_idTextAnchor534"/><a id="_idTextAnchor535"/>rade book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor536"/>Common module settings</h2>
			<p>This screen will let <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>you determine whether or not the course can be seen by learners on the course page. It also includes an ID number and allows you to set it to <strong class="bold">Group mode</strong>, which means that the assignment will be completely different for groups. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor537"/>Restrict access</h2>
			<p>You can restrict learner access<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> by <strong class="bold">Date</strong>, <strong class="bold">Grade</strong>, or <strong class="bold">User profile</strong>, or via your own nested set of restrictions to make access apply only under specific conditions. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor538"/>Activity completion</h2>
			<p>This screen is a <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>helpful tool for learner success because it allows <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>learners to manually mark whether or not the activity is complete. Alternatively, you can set conditions to let the activity appear as completed once the conditions that you've set have been met. Learners are often very motivated by seeing their progress through the course: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer151" class="IMG---Figure">

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor539"/>Tags</h2>
			<p>Moodle 4.0 takes<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> advantage of metatags and the types of approaches used in social media. Adding tags<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> to the assignment can help learners identify which content items and activities align with their learning objectives and course goals: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer152" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.20_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.20 – The Tags configuration settings screen.&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.20 – The Tags configuration settings screen.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor540"/>Competencies</h2>
			<p>If your institution uses outcome <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>assessments or requires competencies toward a certificate or a degree, Moodle 4.0 allows you to add them, and then align the assignments to them. Once you've added competencies and set passing grades, the learner will see that the <strong class="bold">Competency</strong> box is checked when the assignment has been completed:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer153" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.21_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.21 – The Competencies settings screen for the Assignment activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.21 – The Competencies settings screen for the Assignment activity</p>
			<p>After putting <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>together assignments, you may wish to organize them so that they flow adaptively so that learners can automatically review and do remedial activities when needed. In the next section, you will learn how to do that by setti<a id="_idTextAnchor541"/><a id="_idTextAnchor542"/>ng up lessons. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor543"/>Setting up lessons</h1>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>lesson is a complex and powerful type of activity. Essentially, a lesson is a series of web pages that presents information and questions. Lessons take a bit of time to set up, but they are well worth the investment because they incorporate adaptive learning and can direct learners to remedial activities if they do not demonstrate mastery. It will advance them to other content and activities if they complete an activity. Lessons are useful in hybrid courses that incorporate synchronous tutoring or even face-to-face delivery because they can flag where learners may need more help.</p>
			<p>Before you decide to use a lesson, familiarize yourself with its pros and cons. </p>
			<p>A Moodle lesson<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> can be a powerful combination of instruction and assessment. Lesson activities offer the flexibility of a web page, the interactivity of a q<a id="_idTextAnchor544"/>uiz, and branching capabilities. The key is to plan your lesson and storyboard the sequence. For example, for our course, <em class="italic">Dog Grooming for Everyone</em>, you can create a lesson entitled <em class="italic">Dog Grooming Basics: The Breeds and their Characteristics</em>. You can require different content items and activities. Once learners achieve a passing score on the quiz, they can progress. </p>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>add a <strong class="bold">Lesson</strong>, click on <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> and then select <strong class="bold">Lesson</strong> from the menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer154" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.22_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.22 – General settings screen for the Lesson activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.22 – General settings screen for the Lesson activity</p>
			<p>You will have a<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> chance to name your lesson and add a description. Below the <strong class="bold">General</strong> tab are other items that expand when clicked. Notice that several are the same as in the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> activity. However, the <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> and <strong class="bold">Flow control</strong> tabs are different. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor545"/>Planning, creating pages, and adding content</h2>
			<p>A lesson <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>consists of a series of web pages. Usually, a lesson page contains some instructional material and a jump question about the material that the learner just viewed. The jump question is used to test a learner's understanding of the material. Get it right, and you proceed to the next item. Get it wrong, and you're taken back either to the instructional page or jump to a remedial page. </p>
			<p>If you intend to <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>create a lesson that has jumps, clusters, and branches, draw a<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> diagram of the lesson. This type of flowchart or storyboard can tell you what kind of pages you will need to create. You can also use your course map to show where your files should go in the modules, and how they align with learning objectives. </p>
			<p>Then, gather and organize your material in a file. After that, create the pages in the lesson.</p>
			<p>Once the pages are in the Moodle lesson, you can create the jumps. Once you have the pages and jumps, go to the <strong class="bold">Edit Lesson</strong> page and look at the list of all the pages in the lesson. You can compare that list to the diagram that you created when planning the lesson.</p>
			<p>Finally, you can test the lesson from the lea<a id="_idTextAnchor546"/><a id="_idTextAnchor547"/><a id="_idTextAnchor548"/><a id="_idTextAnchor549"/><a id="_idTextAnchor550"/>rner's point of view.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor551"/>Types of lesson pages</h2>
			<p>Once you have<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> named your lesson and saved it, the menu will close and you will go to another screen. Here, you will be able to edit the lesson and add questions, clusters, content pages, a<a id="_idTextAnchor552"/>nd question pages: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer155" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.23_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.23 – Setting up the structure of the lesson and its jumps   &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.23 – Setting up the structure of the lesson and its jumps   </p>
			<p>Let's look <a id="_idTextAnchor553"/>at each type of page.</p>
			<h3>Content pages</h3>
			<p>A content page<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> displays some information and then offers one or more <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>buttons for the learner to click on to navigate to a different content<a id="_idTextAnchor554"/> page or question page.</p>
			<p>Here's the second page from the preceding lesson:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer156" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.24_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.24 – The content page of a lesson  &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.24 – The content page of a lesson  </p>
			<p>The buttons at <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>the bottom of this page are added by the course <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>creator. Note that one of the buttons takes the learner to the next page. However, what if, when you are creating this page, the next page hasn't been created yet? That's not a problem. Once you have created all the pages in your lesson, you can go back to the content pages and add all the jump buttons. Using the relative jumps (previous page, next page, and so <a id="_idTextAnchor555"/><a id="_idTextAnchor556"/><a id="_idTextAnchor557"/>on) is a big time-saver.</p>
			<h3>Cluster with questions</h3>
			<p>A cluster page, end-of-cluster page, and the pages in between them act as a single unit. In our example, we have a cluster<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> with two question pages.</p>
			<p>On the first cluster page, a setting directs Moodle to display an unseen question page in this cluster. You can select other options for a cluster page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer157" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.25_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.25 – Drop-down menu of options for the cluster page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.25 – Drop-down menu of options for the cluster page</p>
			<p>Using the <strong class="bold">Unseen question within a cluster</strong> option turns the cluster into a random question test.</p>
			<p>Between the cluster and the end of the cluster are two question pages. These question pages will jump the learner out of the cluster if they answer correctly, and to a remedial page if th<a id="_idTextAnchor558"/>ey answer incorrectly. </p>
			<p>If you use a cluster like the preceding one, be careful that you do not create an impossible situation. In this case, if the remedial page sent the learner back into the cluster, and the learner had seen both questions, then there is no way the cluster could display an unseen question page. Moodle would give the learner an error message. Again, the key is to plan. </p>
			<p>Instead of <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>sending the learner back into the same cluster, create several clusters in a row. If a learner gets a question correct, you can skip over all the unseen clusters and move on to the next topic. If the learner gets a question incorrect, then you<a id="_idTextAnchor559"/> can send them str<a id="_idTextAnchor560"/>a<a id="_idTextAnchor561"/><a id="_idTextAnchor562"/>ight to the next cluster.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor563"/>Configuring lesson settings</h2>
			<p>When you first create a <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>lesson, you will be presented with a window where you can choose settings for the entire lesson. Before you can add even a single page to a lesson, you must select the lesson settings. If you're not sure about any of these settings, just take your best guess. You can always return to this page and change the settings. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember that one of the advantages of Moodle is the ease with which you can experiment with and change your course material. Get accustomed to taking a bolder, more experimental approach to using Moodle, and you will enjoy it a lot more.</p>
			<p>This window is broken into the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Appearance</li>
				<li>Availability </li>
				<li>Flow control</li>
				<li>Grade</li>
				<li>Common module settings</li>
				<li>Restrict access</li>
				<li>Activity completion</li>
				<li>Tags</li>
				<li>Competencies</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, I'll go<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> through the <strong class="bold">Editing Lesson</strong> page from top to bottom. I'll focus on the settings that are unique to the lesson activity. So, by the end of this section, you will understand how most of the settings on the <strong class="bold">Editing Lesson</strong> page affec<a id="_idTextAnchor564"/>t the learner's experience.</p>
			<h3>General settings</h3>
			<p>This section consists of only <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>the name of the lesson, which learners will see on the course's home page. If you want the learners to see a description of the lesson before they enter the lesson, you will need to complete the <strong class="bold">Description</strong> field and also<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> add a label to the course home<a id="_idTextAnchor565"/> page to de<a id="_idTextAnchor566"/>scribe the lesson.</p>
			<h3>Appearance</h3>
			<p>This section<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> contains settings that affec<a id="_idTextAnchor567"/>t how the lesson is presented.</p>
			<h3>Linked media</h3>
			<p>You can upload a <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>file into this field. When the learner enters the lesson, the file will be displayed in a pop-up window. This enables the learner to refer to the file as t<a id="_idTextAnchor568"/>hey proceed through the lesson.</p>
			<p>The pop-up window might be blocked by the learner's browser. To ensure that the learner knows that there is a file they should see, consider adding a message to the first page of the lesson that tells the learner to open the file if it has not opened automatically. </p>
			<p>While you are reading this lesson, they will need to refer to a diagram. To show that diagram, on the left menu bar, under <strong class="bold">Linked Media</strong>, cl<a id="_idTextAnchor569"/>ick on <strong class="bold">Click here to view link</strong>.</p>
			<p>After you display the dia<a id="_idTextAnchor570"/>gram, proceed to the next page.</p>
			<h3>Display ongoing score</h3>
			<p>When this is set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, each page of the <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>lesson displays the learner's score and the number of possible points so far.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">This displays the number of points that the learner could have earned for the pages that they have viewed so far.</p>
			<p>If a lesson is not linear and it branches, the path that each learner takes through the lesson can change. This means that each learner can have the chance to earn a different number of points. For example, you may create a lesson with many branches and pages and then require the learner to earn at least 200 points on that lesson. This will<a id="_idTextAnchor571"/> encourage the learner to explore the lesson and try different branches until they <a id="_idTextAnchor572"/>have earned the required points.</p>
			<h3>Display left menu and Minimum grade to display menu</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Display left menu</strong> displays<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> a navigation bar on the left of the slideshow window. The navigation bar enables the learner to navigate to any slide. Without that navigation bar, the learner must proceed through the slideshow in the order that Moodle displays the lesson pages and must complete the lesson to exit (or the learner can force the window to close).</p>
			<p>Sometimes, you may want a learner to complete the entire lesson, in order, before allowing them to move <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>around the lesson freely. The <strong class="bold">Minimum grade to display menu</strong> setting accomplishes this. Only if the learner achieved the specified grade will they see the navigation menu. You can use this setting to ensure that the learner goes completely through the lesson the first time, before allowing the learner<a id="_idTextAnchor573"/><a id="_idTextAnchor574"/><a id="_idTextAnchor575"/> to freely move around the lesson.</p>
			<h3>Maximum number of answers </h3>
			<p>At the<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> bottom of each question page in a lesson, <strong class="bold">Maximum number of answers </strong>determines the maximum number of choices that each question can have. For example, if this were set to <strong class="bold">4</strong>, each question could have, at most, four choices: <strong class="bold">a</strong>, <strong class="bold">b</strong>, <strong class="bold">c</strong>, and <strong class="bold">d</strong>.</p>
			<p>If each answer sends the learner to a different page, the number of answers is also the number of branches possible. Set this to the highest number of answers that any of your questions will have. After creating question pages, you c<a id="_idTextAnchor576"/>an increase or decrease this setting without affecting the quest<a id="_idTextAnchor577"/>ions that you have already created.</p>
			<p>Use default feedback</p>
			<p>If this<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> is set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, Moodle does not see any custom feedback that you created for a question; it will display a default message, such as <strong class="bold">That's correct</strong> or <strong class="bold">That's incorrect</strong>, instead. The default feedback is set in Moodle's language file, so it will be translated into whatever language the course is using. If you set this to <strong class="bold">No</strong>, and Moodle does not see any custom feedback that you created for a question, Moodle w<a id="_idTextAnchor578"/>ill not display an<a id="_idTextAnchor579"/>y feedback when the learner answers.</p>
			<h3>Link to next activity</h3>
			<p>This setting allows you to<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> put a link to another ac<a id="_idTextAnchor580"/>tivity in the course at the end of the lesson. <a id="_idTextAnchor581"/>For example, you can link to a quiz. </p>
			<h3>Prerequisite lesson</h3>
			<p>The settings in this<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> section allow you to require the learner to view another lesson before this lesson is open to the learner. One of the settings allows you to specify how many minutes the learner must spend on a previous lesson. You can use that setting to ensure that the learner spends a certain amount of time watching a video before moving on to the next lesson. You can do this by embedding the video in the prerequisite lesson.</p>
			<p>The prerequisite lesson settings are in addition to the <strong class="bold">Restrict access</strong> settings that are available for all activities. With the <strong class="bold">Restrict access</strong> settings, you do not have the option to specify the amount of time that must be spent on anothe<a id="_idTextAnchor582"/><a id="_idTextAnchor583"/><a id="_idTextAnchor584"/>r activity as<a id="_idTextAnchor585"/> a condition for access. </p>
			<h3>Flow control</h3>
			<p>This section <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>contains settings that affect how a learner moves through the lesson:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer158" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.26_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.26 – The Flow control screen for the Lesson activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.26 – The Flow <a id="_idTextAnchor586"/>control screen for the Lesson activity</p>
			<h3>Allow learner review</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Allow learner review</strong> enables <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>a learner to go backward in a lesson and retry questions that they got wrong. This differs from just using the <a id="_idTextAnchor587"/><strong class="bold">Back</strong> button on the browser, in that this setting enables the learner to retry questions, <a id="_idTextAnchor588"/>whereas using the <strong class="bold">Back</strong> button does not.</p>
			<h3>Provide option to try a question again</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Provide option to try a question again</strong> displays<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> a message after the learner incorrectly answers a question. The message invites the learner to try the question again, but for no points.</p>
			<p>When you create a question in a lesson, you can create feedback for each of the answers to that question. However, if you set <strong class="bold">Provide option to try a question again</strong> to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, Moodle will override the feedback that you created for the answers. Instead, it will display a message asking you to try a question again.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">If you have created custom feedback for the answers in your lesson but Moodle is not displaying the feedback that you created, check the <strong class="bold">Provide option to try a question again</strong> settin<a id="_idTextAnchor589"/><a id="_idTextAnchor590"/>g. It might be set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. Set it to <strong class="bold">No</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Maximum number of  attempts</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Maximum number of attempts</strong> determines<a id="_idTextAnchor591"/> how many times a learner can attempt any question. This app<a id="_idTextAnchor592"/>lies to all the <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>questions in the lesson.</p>
			<h3>Number of pages to show</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Number of pages to show</strong> determines how many pages are shown. If the lesson contains more than this <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>number, the lesson ends after reaching the number set here. If the lesson contains fewer than this number, the lesson ends after every page has been shown. If you set this to zero, the lesso<a id="_idTextAnchor593"/><a id="_idTextAnchor594"/>n ends when all the pages have been shown.</p>
			<h3>Grade</h3>
			<p>A lesson can be <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>graded or ungraded. You can also allow learners to retake the lesson. While Moodle allows you to grade a lesson, remember that a lesson's primary purpose is to teach, not test.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Don't use a lesson to do the work of a quiz or assignment.</p>
			<p>The lesson's score is there to give you feedb<a id="_idTextAnchor595"/>ack on the effectiveness of each page and to enable learners to judge their progress:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer159" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.27_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.27 – The Grade settings screen for the Lesson activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.27 – The Gra<a id="_idTextAnchor596"/>de settings screen for the Lesson activity</p>
			<h3>Practice lesson</h3>
			<p>If you set <strong class="bold">Practice lesson</strong> to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, this lesson will not show up in the grade book. In a practice lesson, learners<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> see a grade after completing the activity, but this grade is only for them. It is not recorded or displayed in the gr<a id="_idTextAnchor597"/>ade book, and teachers canno<a id="_idTextAnchor598"/>t see it. It's a pure self-studying option.</p>
			<h3>Custom scoring</h3>
			<p>Normally, a correct answer to a question is worth the entire point value for the question, and each wrong <a id="_idIndexMarker492"/>answer is worth zero. Enabling <strong class="bold">Custom scoring</strong> allows you to set a point value for each answer to a question. Use this if some answers are <em class="italic">more right</em> or <em class="italic">more wrong</em> than others. For example, you could develop history quizzes in which the distractors range from almost correct to completely wrong, such as the same century versus the wrong century. You can also use thi<a id="_idTextAnchor599"/>s to set the point value for a question. If a question is more important<a id="_idTextAnchor600"/>, use custom scoring to <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>give it more points.</p>
			<h3>Handling retakes</h3>
			<p>This setting is only <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>relevant if the learner is allowed to repeat the lesson (the setting is set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>). When learners are allowed to retake the lesson, the grades shown on the <strong class="bold">Grades</strong> page are either the average<a id="_idTextAnchor601"/><a id="_idTextAnchor602"/><a id="_idTextAnchor603"/> of the retakes or the learner's best grade.</p>
			<h3>Minimum number of questions</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Minimum number of questions</strong> sets <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>the lower limit for the number of questions used to calculate a learner's grade on the lesson. It is only relevant when the lesson will be graded. If the learner doesn't answer this minimum number of questions, the lesson is not graded.</p>
			<p>If you don't see this setting, it is probably b<a id="_idTextAnchor604"/>ecause you have <strong class="bold">Practice lesson</strong> set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. Set <strong class="bold">Practice lesson</strong> to <strong class="bold">No</strong> and sav<a id="_idTextAnchor605"/><a id="_idTextAnchor606"/><a id="_idTextAnchor607"/><a id="_idTextAnchor608"/><a id="_idTextAnchor609"/>e the page; you should see this setting appear.</p>
			<h3>Adding a content page</h3>
			<p>A content page<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> consists of a page of links to the other pages in your lesson. At this point, immediately after you've finished the lesson settings page, your lesson won't have any pages. However, if you want to begin your lesson with a page of instructions, you can add a content page and make it jump to the next page. When you're creating a content page, you w<a id="_idTextAnchor610"/>ill see something similar to the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer160" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.28_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.28 – Setting up a content page&#13;&#13;&#10;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.28 – Setting up a content page</p>
			<p>When the<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> learner runs the lesson, the content page will look like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer161" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.29_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.29 – Learner view of the content page to initiate the lesson&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.29 – Learner <a id="_idTextAnchor611"/><a id="_idTextAnchor612"/>view of the content page to initiate the lesson</p>
			<h3>Adding a cluster</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">cluster</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>group of question pages. Within this cluster, you can require the learner to correctly answer <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>several questions before they're allowed to proceed out of the cluster. This enables you to test that a learner understands a concept before moving on.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can display a random page from the cluster, and from that page, proceed to any other page in the lesson. This enables you to send each learner down a different random pathway in the lesson so that not all learners have the same experience. For example, you can let them take different paths to cover Mesoamerican history. </p>
			<p>A cluster <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>consists of a<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> beginning cluste<a id="_idTextAnchor613"/>r page,<a id="_idTextAnchor614"/> an end-of-cluster page, and pages in between them.</p>
			<h3>Adding a question page</h3>
			<p>This option enables you to<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> add a question page to your lesson using Moodle's built-in editor. The process of creating a question page will be covered in the next section.</p>
			<p>Try adding your question pages first. Then, put a content page with instructions at the beginning of the lesson. If needed, or<a id="_idTextAnchor615"/>ganize your question pages into branches or clusters. Finally, end the lesso<a id="_idTextAnchor616"/>n with a content page to say goodbye to the learner.</p>
			<h4>Creating a question page</h4>
			<p>Once you've <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>filled out and saved the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page, it's time to create the first question page. Even though it's called a <em class="italic">question page</em>, the page can contain more than just a question. It's a web page, so you can add any content to it. Usually, it contains information and a question to test the learner's understanding. You can choose different types of<a id="_idTextAnchor617"/> questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Multiple choice </li>
				<li>True/false </li>
				<li>Short answer</li>
				<li>Numeric </li>
				<li>Matching</li>
				<li>Essay</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These can be found under <strong class="bold">Select a question type</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.30_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.30 – Adding a question type screen for the Lesson activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.30 – Adding a question type screen for the Lesson activity</p>
			<p>You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>create feedback for each answer to the question, similar to creating feedback for the answers to a quiz question. In addition, you can make the lesson jump to a new page, based on the answer the learner selects.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can see that the question page contains a question that lets you jump to another location. Note that for each answer, there is a <strong class="bold">Response</strong> field that the learner sees immediately after submitting the answer. There is also a <strong class="bold">Jump</strong> field for each answer. For the incorrect answer that you see, <strong class="bold">Jump</strong> can take the learner to a remedial page or redisplay the current page so that they can try again. For the correct answer, <strong class="bold">Jump</strong> can display the next page in the lesson, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.31_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.31 – Configuring the answers so that they jump to the appropriate page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.31 – Configuring the answers so that they jump to the appropriate page</p>
			<p>Let's look at what's available <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>on this page in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Page Title</strong>: This will be displayed a<a id="_idTextAnchor618"/><a id="_idTextAnchor619"/><a id="_idTextAnchor620"/>t the top of the page when it is shown in the lesson.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Page Contents</strong>: As we mentioned previously, a lesson page is a web page. It can contain anything that you can put on any other Moodle web page. Us<a id="_idTextAnchor621"/>ually, it will contain information and<a id="_idTextAnchor622"/> then a question to test the learner's understanding.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Answers</strong>: This will be displayed <a id="_idTextAnchor623"/>at the bottom of the lesson page, after <strong class="bold">Page Contents</strong>. The learner can select an answer in resp<a id="_idTextAnchor624"/>onse to the question posed in the <strong class="bold">Page Contents</strong> area.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Responses</strong>: For each answer that the learner sele<a id="_idTextAnchor625"/>cts, its respons<a id="_idTextAnchor626"/>e is sh<a id="_idTextAnchor627"/>own before the learner is taken to a new page.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jumps</strong>: Each answe<a id="_idTextAnchor628"/>r that a learner selects results in a jump to a page.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">This page</strong>: If the jump is <strong class="bold">This page</strong>, the learn<a id="_idTextAnchor629"/>er stays on the same page. T<a id="_idTextAnchor630"/>he learner can then try to answer the question again.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Next page or Previous page</strong>: If the jump is <strong class="bold">Next page</strong> or <strong class="bold">Previous page</strong>, the learner is <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>taken to the next or previous page, respectively. After you rearrange the pages in a le<a id="_idTextAnchor631"/>sson, this jump may give you different results. Just be aware that this is a <strong class="bold">relative</strong> jump. This is best for a linear lesson: </li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer164" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.32_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.32 – Editing screen for the Lesson activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor632"/>Figure 6.32 – Editing screen for the Lesson activity</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Speciﬁc pages</strong>: You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>select a specific page to jump to. The pull-down list displays all the lesson page's titles. If you select a specific page to jump to, the jump will remain the <a id="_idTextAnchor633"/><a id="_idTextAnchor634"/><a id="_idTextAnchor635"/>same, even if you rearrange the pages in your lesson.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For a jump, if you select <strong class="bold">Unseen question with a branch</strong>, the learner will be taken to a question page that they have not answered correctly in this session. That question page will be in the same cluster as the current page.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">An unseen question with a branch takes the learner to a question page that they haven't answered correctly. The learner m<a id="_idTextAnchor636"/><a id="_idTextAnchor637"/><a id="_idTextAnchor638"/><a id="_idTextAnchor639"/><a id="_idTextAnchor640"/>a<a id="_idTextAnchor641"/><a id="_idTextAnchor642"/><a id="_idTextAnchor643"/>y have seen the page before and answered incorrectly. </p>
			<h3>Editing the lesson</h3>
			<p>Once you've created <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>several le<a id="_idTextAnchor644"/>sson pages, you may want to see and edit the <a id="_idTextAnchor645"/>flow of the lesson. You can do this under the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> tab.</p>
			<h3>Collapsed and expanded</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> tab is where you edit the content of your lesson. From here, you can add, delete, rearrange, and edit individual lesson pages.</p>
			<p>Under the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> tab, when <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>you select <strong class="bold">Collapsed</strong>, you will see a list of the pages in your lesson, such as the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.33_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.33 – After selecting the Collapsed option, you will see a list of pages in your lesson&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.33 – After selecting the Collapsed option, you will see a list of pages in your lesson</p>
			<p>The pages display in their<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> logical order, which would be the shortest path through the lesson if a learner got all of the questions correct. Note that the content of the pages is not displayed. The purpose of this screen is not to edit individu<a id="_idTextAnchor646"/><a id="_idTextAnchor647"/><a id="_idTextAnchor648"/>al questions but to help you see the flow of the lesson.</p>
			<h3>Rearranging pages</h3>
			<p>To rearrange the<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> pages, click on the <em class="italic">up</em>/<em class="italic">down</em> arrow, <img src="image/icon_1.png" alt=""/>, for the page that you want to move. Note that it is the jumps that determine the order in which Moodle presents the pages. If a question is set to jump to the next page, rearranging the pages can change the jumps. A question can also be set to jump to a specific, named page. In that case, the order in which the pages appear doesn't det<a id="_idTextAnchor649"/>ermine the landing <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>point for the ju<a id="_idTextAnchor650"/>mp, so rearranging the pages here won't affect that jump.</p>
			<h3>Editing pages</h3>
			<p>From the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> tab, to<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> edit a page, click on the <em class="italic">edit</em> icon, which usually looks like this: <img src="image/icon_2.png" alt=""/> . Clicking on this takes you to the editing page for that page. The previous section <a id="_idTextAnchor651"/>provided detailed instructions for editing a lesson page.</p>
			<h3>Adding pages</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Add a page here</strong> drop-down <a id="_idTextAnchor652"/>list enables you to insert a new page into the lesson. You can choose from <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>several different kinds of pages.</p>
			<p>In this section, you learned how to create adaptive lessons, which will enhance the learning experience by providing remedial content. After putting together the lessons, it is a good idea to motivate learners by giving them a chance to provide feedback. In the next<a id="_idTextAnchor653"/> section, you will learn how to develop feedback modules. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor654"/>Developing feedback modules</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> allows you to create surveys for your learners. The <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity is often confused with the <strong class="bold">Survey</strong> activity. In a <strong class="bold">Survey</strong> activity, you must choose from several pre-made surveys; you cannot build surveys. Also, do not confuse this with the questionnaire module. A questionnaire <a id="_idTextAnchor655"/><a id="_idTextAnchor656"/>is an add-on, while <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> comes as standard with Moodle.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor657"/>Feedback isn't just for learners</h2>
			<p>Of course, you can use a <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity to survey your learners. You can also use it to do the<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Survey the employees in your workplace.</li>
				<li>Collect data from people who have agreed to be research subjects.</li>
				<li>Conduct public <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/>opinion surveys of the visitors to your site.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity allows you to create different kinds of questions: multiple choice, dropdown, short an<a id="_idTextAnchor658"/>swer, and more. You can share the res<a id="_idTextAnchor659"/>ults of feedback with the learners or keep them confidential.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor660"/>Creating a Feedback activity</h2>
			<p>Let's imagine <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>that we're developing a course called <em class="italic">Dog Grooming for Everyone</em>. In the course, we have a module called <em class="italic">Dog Grooming Tools</em>. Creating a <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity is similar to adding a quiz. First, you add the activity, and then you add the questions. We'll cover each in the following sections separately.</p>
			<p>To add a <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">From the <strong class="bold">Add an activity or resource</strong> menu, select <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong>.</li>
				<li>Moodle will display the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> page for the activity.</li>

The rest of this procedure covers settings that are common to almost all question types. For settings that are specific to a question type, please refer to the next section.</p></li>
				<li>If you mark a question as <strong class="bold">Required</strong>, the user must answer it to submit<a id="_idTextAnchor662"/> the feedback. The question will have a red asterisk next to it.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Question</strong> field <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>contains the text of the question. Unlike a quiz question, a feedback question can only consist of text:</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="6">The <strong class="bold">Label</strong> field contains a label that only teachers will see when viewing the results of the feedback. The most important reason for the <strong class="bold">Label</strong> field is when you plan to export the results of the feedback to an Excel worksheet. The label is exported with the results. This allows you to match the feedback results with a short label in your database.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Position</strong> field<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> determines the order of the question when you first add it to the feedback page. Once the question has been added, you can override this number and move the question to any position on the page.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Depend item</strong> and <strong class="bold">Depend value</strong> can be used to make the appearance of a question dependent on the answer to a previous question. For example, you may first ask someone, <strong class="bold">Do you have a Twitter account?</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>If they answer with <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, you might display a question such as <strong class="bold">How often do you tweet?</strong>. If they answer with <strong class="bold">No</strong>, you would hide that question. From the <strong class="bold">Dependence item</strong> drop-down list, select the question whose answer will determine whether this question appears. Then, in the <strong class="bold">Dependence value</strong> field, enter the answer that is needed to make this question appear.</p>

			</ol>
			<h3>Question types</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> allows you to add several types of questions. Some of these are not que<a id="_idTextAnchor664"/><a id="_idTextAnchor665"/><a id="_idTextAnchor666"/>stions, but you can still add them from the same drop-down menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer173" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.39_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.39 – Drop-down menu of question types&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor667"/></p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.39 – Drop-down menu of question types</p>
			<h4>Adding a page break<a id="_idTextAnchor668"/></h4>
			<p><strong class="bold">Add a page break</strong> inserts a <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>page break into the <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity.</p>
			<h4>Avoiding bots with CAPTCHA</h4>
			<p>If you allow guests to complete the<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> form for access, you may need a level of security to avoid bots. A <strong class="bold">CAPTCHA</strong> is a test that ensures that a human is filling out an online form. It displays a picture of some text, and the user must read and type in that text. If the user doesn't type the text correct<a id="_idTextAnchor669"/>ly, the feedback form is rejected. This prevents software robots fr<a id="_idTextAnchor670"/>om automatically filling in your feedback and spamming your results.</p>
			<h4>Inserting information</h4>
			<p>You can use this option to<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> insert information about the feedback into the form. That information is added by Moodle and submitted with the user's answers. At the time of writing, the options are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Response time</strong>: The date and time at which the user submitted the feedback</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Course</strong>: The short name of the course in which this feedback appears</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Course ca<a id="_idTextAnchor671"/><a id="_idTextAnchor672"/>tegory</strong>: The short <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>name of the category in which this feedback appears</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Adding a label</h4>
			<p>This is the same as <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>adding a label to a course home page. The label can be anything that you can put on a <a id="_idTextAnchor673"/>web page. This is a good way to in<a id="_idTextAnchor674"/>sert an explanation, instructions, and encouragement into the activity.</p>
			<h4>Creating a text box for a longer text answer</h4>
			<p>Use this <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>question type to create a text box where the user can type in an answer. Here, you can specify how many characters wide and how many lines high the text box is. If the user runs out of space, <a id="_idTextAnchor675"/><a id="_idTextAnchor676"/><a id="_idTextAnchor677"/>Moodle adds a scroll bar to the box so that the user can keep on typing.</p>
			<h4>Displaying multiple-choice questions</h4>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>multiple-choice question displays a list of responses. There are three subtypes of multiple-choice questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multiple choice – multiple answers</strong>: In this question, Moodle displays a checkbox next to each response. The user can select as many as they want. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multiple choice – single answer</strong>: In this question, Moodle displays a radio button next to each response. The user must select only one response.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multiple choice – single answer allowed </strong>(drop-down list): In this question, Moodle displays a drop-down list of the responses. The user must select only one response.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You create the responses for a multiple-choice question by entering one response on each line in the <strong class="bold">Mul<a id="_idTextAnchor678"/>tiple choice values</strong> field. For example, consider the following settings:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer174" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.40_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.40 – Setting up Multiple choice&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.40 – Setting up Multiple choice</p>
			<p>Create <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>the following question:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer175" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.41_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.41 – Configuring the answers so that they jump to the appropriate page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.41 – Configuring the answers so that they jump to the appropriate page</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Note that the <strong class="bold">Adjustment</strong> setting for this question is set to <strong class="bold">Horizontal</strong>. This causes the responses to be listed horizontally, across the page, instead of in a vertical list.</p>
			<p>Also, note<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> the setting for the <strong class="bold">Hide the "Not selected" </strong>option. If this is set to <strong class="bold">No</strong>, Moodle will add a <strong class="bold">Not selected</strong> response to the li<a id="_idTextAnchor679"/>st of responses that you create.<a id="_idTextAnchor680"/> When set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, Moodle will only display the responses that you create.</p>
			<h4>Creating multiple-choice questions</h4>
			<p>To the user, this type <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>of question appears identical to a multiple-choice single-answer question. However, when you review the results, you will see a number that is associated with each answer. This allows you to calculate averages and perform other calculations with the data that you collect.</p>
			<p>In this example, the ans<a id="_idTextAnchor681"/>wers are rated <strong class="bold">4</strong> through <strong class="bold">0</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer176" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.42_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.42 – Text for the feedback options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.42 – Text for the feedback options</p>
			<p>The user <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>doesn't see these numbers when they select an answer, but when the teacher looks at the analysis for the question, the average is displayed. Also, whe<a id="_idTextAnchor682"/>n the results of the feedback are exported to Excel, the rating numbers are exported. This e<a id="_idTextAnchor683"/>nables you to do an advanced analysis of your results using a spreadsheet.</p>
			<h4>Numeric answer</h4>
			<p>Use this type of <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>quest<a id="_idTextAnchor684"/>ion to as<a id="_idTextAnchor685"/>k the user to enter a number. You can specify a range that you will accept.</p>
			<h4>Short-text answer</h4>
			<p>A short-text-answer question lets you limit the amount of text that the user enters. You specify the<a id="_idTextAnchor686"/><a id="_idTextAnchor687"/><a id="_idTextAnchor688"/> <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>size of the text entry box and the amount of text that the box will accept.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor689"/>Viewing feedback</h2>
			<p>Teachers a<a id="_idTextAnchor690"/>nd<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> administrators can view the responses to a <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> acti<a id="_idTextAnchor691"/>vity. You can view the responses one at a time or a summary of all responses.</p>
			<h3>Seeing individual responses</h3>
			<p>If <strong class="bold">Record User Names</strong> is set to <strong class="bold">User's Names Will Be Logged and Shown With Answers</strong>, the teacher<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> will be able to see a list of users who completed the feedback and their answers. To see this list of responses, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">Feedback</strong> activity.</li>
				<li>From the left menu, select <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Feedback administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Show resp<a id="_idTextAnchor692"/>onses</strong>.</li>
				<li>For the<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/> learner whose responses you wan<a id="_idTextAnchor693"/>t to see, click on the date:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer177" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.43_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.43 – Selecting learner answers to see&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.43 – Selecting learner answers to see</p>
			<h3>Analyzing responses with the Analysis tab</h3>
			<p>Under the <strong class="bold">Analysis</strong> tab, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>see a summary of all the responses. On this page, you also have an <strong class="bold">Export to Excel</strong> button, which will download all the data to an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
			<p>It is good to keep in mind that feedback is important not only after a lesson or set of assignments but also after a synchronous web conference or tutoring session. The advantage of using Moodle for the feedback over using it within BigBlueButton or Zoom is that you will have a more durable record of it within the current and archived courses in Moodle. For more involved questions or surveys, the ideal tool is <strong class="bold">Choice</strong>. You can use <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> for feedback as well as <a id="_idTextAnchor694"/><a id="_idTextAnchor695"/><a id="_idTextAnchor696"/>for engagers, such as "Check Your Understanding" types of quizzes or engagers. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor697"/>Exploring Choice</h1>
			<p>Moodle's <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> simplest type of activity. In a <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> activity, you create one question and specify a choice of responses. You can use <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Take a quick poll.</li>
				<li>Ask learners to choose sides in a debate.</li>
				<li>Confirm the learners' understanding of an agreement.</li>
				<li>Gather consent.</li>
				<li>Allow learners to choose a subject for an essay or project.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before we loo<a id="_idTextAnchor698"/>k at how to accomplish this, let's look at the <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> activity from the learner's point of view<a id="_idTextAnchor699"/><a id="_idTextAnchor700"/><a id="_idTextAnchor701"/><a id="_idTextAnchor702"/><a id="_idTextAnchor703"/><a id="_idTextAnchor704"/><a id="_idTextAnchor705"/><a id="_idTextAnchor706"/><a id="_idTextAnchor707"/> and then explore the settings available to the teacher while creating a <strong class="bold">choice</strong>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor708"/>The learner's point of view</h2>
			<p>From the<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> learner's point of view, a <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> activity <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>looks like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer178" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.44_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.44 – View of the Choice activity from the learner's view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.44 – View of the Choice activity from the learner's view</p>
			<p>There are a few things to note about this choice activity:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The learner can see how many other learners have chosen a response. </li>
				<li>There is a limit on the number of learners who can choose each response. </li>
				<li>The learner can remove their choice and submit again.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are options<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> that you can set for the activity. The teacher <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>could have also hidden other learners' re<a id="_idTextAnchor709"/>sponses, placed no limit on the number of learners who can choose each response, and prevented the learner from changing their response:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer179" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.45_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.45 – Combined Choice results&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.45 – Combined Choice results</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor710"/>The teacher's point of view</h2>
			<p>Before we discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>some of the uses for a <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> activity, let's<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> look at the settings that are avai<a id="_idTextAnchor711"/>lable on the <strong class="bold">Editing choice</strong> page. Then, we'll learn how to make creative use of these capabilities.</p>
			<h3>Limit</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Limit</strong> option next <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>to each choice allows you to limit how many learners can select that choice. In the preceding example, no more than four learners can select each <a id="_idTextAnchor712"/>choice, so after four learners have selected a team, that choice becomes unavailable.</p>
			<p>For limits to take effect, <strong class="bold">Limit the number of responses allowed</strong> must be set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer180" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.46_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.46 – The Options settings screen in the Choice activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.46 – The Options settings screen in the Choice activity</p>
			<h3>Display Mod<a id="_idTextAnchor713"/>e</h3>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>preceding example, <strong class="bold">Display Mode</strong> is set to <strong class="bold">Vertical</strong>. You can also arrange the choices horizontally.</p>
			<h3>Publish results</h3>
			<p>You can choose<a id="_idIndexMarker555"/> whether to reveal the results of the choice to the learners and, if so, when.</p>
			<p>In the example at the beginning of this section, <strong class="bold">Publish results</strong> was set to <strong class="bold">Always show results to learners</strong>; this is why the learner could see how many learners had chosen each response. If it had been set to <strong class="bold">Do not publish results to learners</strong>, the activity would not have shown how many learners had selected each response:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer181" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.47_B17288.jpg" alt="Figure 6.47 – The Results settings screen in the Choice activity&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.47 – The Results settings screen in the Choice activity</p>
			<p>If you limit the number of learners who can choose a response, consider using <strong class="bold">Always s<a id="_idTextAnchor714"/>how results to learners</strong>. That way, the learner can see how many others have chosen the response and how many slots are left for each response.</p>
			<h3>Privacy of results</h3>
			<p>If you publish <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>the results of the choice, you can choose whether to publish the names of the learners who have selected each response. In the example at the beginning of this section, <strong class="bold">Priva<a id="_idTextAnchor715"/>cy of results</strong> was set to <strong class="bold">Publish full results</strong>, so the<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> learner could see who had selected each response.</p>
			<h3>Allowing learners to change their minds</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Allow choice to be updated</strong> setting determines whether a learner can change their answer after <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>submitting it. If this is set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, a learner can retake the <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> activity until the activity is closed.</p>
			<p>In an environment where instructors use a combination of synchronous and asynchronous delivery, having the ability to include survey and feedback tools can be vital in mainta<a id="_idTextAnchor716"/>ining engagement and determining the effectiveness of content, activities, and lessons. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor717"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Activities are very important in the Moodle framework because they allow learners to demonstrate competency, as well as staying engaged and motivated. They also allow course designers to connect learning outcomes to the overall competency frameworks that may be required by governing bodies.</p>
			<p>In Moodle 4.0, the activities have been streamlined so that there are not as many, but many have increased their functionality to be even more collaborative and interactive to keep learners engaged and motivated. Moodle 4.0 has made it easier for learners to see where they are in a course by making enhancements to the Assignment activity, as well as others, to indicate whether an activity has been completed, and whether or not the minimum passing score has been achieved. </p>
			<p>Moodle's <strong class="bold">Assignment </strong>and <strong class="bold">Lesson</strong> activities allow you to create course material that learners can interact with. This interaction is more engaging, and usually more effective, than courses consisting of static material that the learners view. While you will probably begin creating your course by adding static material, the next step should usually be to ask, "How can I add interactivity to this course?"</p>
			<p>There are many ways to build engaging assignments and Moodle provides many different activities to help you do so. You can customize your solutions, so as you work through this unit, please take a moment to experiment. Remember, you can always delete and modify your work. So, play in the sandbox!</p>
			<p>Lessons can take the place of many static web pages since they consist of web pages with a question at the end of each page. A lesson allows you to present information to a learner, test the learner on the information, and then either present remedial information or continue to the next topic.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Feedback </strong>and <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> activities allow teachers to assess learners, their attitudes, and their satisfaction with a course. Feedback is especially useful for assessing the class's attitude and experience at the beginning of the course. You can also use feedback to create surveys for people who are not even taking a course, such as an employee survey or research data.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Choice</strong> activity is especially useful for having a structured, ongoing conversation between the learners and teacher. You can create several of these, keep them hidden, and reveal them when you want to measure the learners' attitudes.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to evaluate learners using the <strong class="bold">Quiz</strong> activity.</p>
