- en: In the last chapter, you learned the best way to develop a course in Moodle
    that would be used for self-directed and self-guided students. In that case, the
    focus was primarily on creating a course that was very clear, self-explanatory,
    and easy to follow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, as we turn to other types of courses, you'll find that most of the guidelines
    you followed in developing courses for independent study also apply to courses
    that are instructor-led and include groups of students who work together. The
    group, or the cohort, progresses together, and the advantage of having an individual
    instructor lies in the fact that he/she can provide guidance and personalized
    feedback to the students.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you'll learn how to best set up a cohort-based course that
    allows teacher-student interaction. We'll review the best structure to use and
    the best combination of plugins, resources, and activities to make sure that your
    course is very flexible and meets the needs of students and teachers, and also
    provides behind-the-scenes support, which includes Moodle administrators and instructional
    designers.

    course, and keep in mind that the course revolves around instructor communication
    and guidance along with coordinated student performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we'll look at the main sources of student and instructor anxiety. Students
    on an online course that is guided by an instructor are often most worried about
    the expectations of the instructor. Further, they want to make sure that they
    are not going to get lost while looking for the course material and exams, and
    can perform well in a timely fashion. Instructors want to be able to communicate
    effectively with students and provide timely and effective feedback on assessments.

    courses can vary widely in their length, scope, complexity, and goals. In colleges
    and universities, some can require as few as four weeks to complete. Others, however,
    focus on 8 week or 16 week semester-long courses. Some organizations may cover
    the material in 4 weeks, with four separate weekly milestones (topics or units).
    Online instructor-led, cohort-based courses can be offered by colleges, universities,
    corporations, not-for-profit organizations, retailers, and other organizations
    that need to provide educational courses and training.

    the face-to-face arrangement of traditional courses, and follow, more or less,
    the same philosophy. The focus is on the content that is accessed and discussed
    by class members in an orderly fashion as the term progresses. Guidance is provided
    by an instructor who explains the material, provides feedback, and shows students
    the best way to learn and perform so that they can achieve the course goals and
    outcomes.

    limitations, and the fact that course shells or templates once built can be copied,

    Although it is true that courses for independent study can be copied and deployed,
    the user experience is not the same as that in a cohort-based course. In a well
    run and successful cohort-based course, students have a feeling of community and
    support.
