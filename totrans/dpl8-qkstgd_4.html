<p>In the preceding chapter we learned about content types. We also learned about designing new content types for specific needs, how to create them, and adding fields to them for storing data and making it available as selection criteria. Now that we've discussed the classification and storage of content, let's switch to the content, itself.</p>
<p>Drupal <span>sites are all about content.</span> In order for the site to present content to the visitor it needs to contain content. How does content get into the Drupal site? <span>In this chapter, you will learn how to work with content, create it and edit it. Throughout this chapter you will create content (for use later in this book), and will learn to do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><span>Use the WYSIWYG editor</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span>Configure the editor for other roles</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span>Navigate the various fields on the content creation form</span></li>
<li>Preview content</li>
<li class="mce-root"><span>Publish content</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span>Define a custom URL for content</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span>Add attachments and multiple instances of fields</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span>Make content stick to the homepage</span></li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When you send a text message from your phone, you type the text, and that's pretty much all there is to it in terms of the content's appearance. You're limited to choosing whether you want to use capital letters. If you want more control over your message, you can switch to sending an email message, which might enable you to select bold, italic, or underlined text.</p>
<p>If you want to send highly formatted content, text with headings, font changes, text color, bulleted lists, and so forth, you might use word processing software, such as Word, Pages, or LibreOffice.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>This class of software creates what is called <em>rich text</em>, that is, text rich in styling, and the generic term for software capable of creating a document containing rich text is <em>rich text editor</em>. </p>
<p>Drupal 8 includes a rich text editor called CKEditor. It is a highly configurable editor with a composition area, as shown in the following screenshot, that resembles standalone word processors with formatting buttons. This type of editor is referred to as <strong>WYSIWYG</strong>, which is pronounced as wizzy-wig, which stands for <strong>What You See Is What You Get</strong>, meaning that the text it displays shows the selected formatting:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-314 image-border" src="assets/fa140eff-f494-4ee8-8692-090d318bc3da.png" style="width:35.25em;height:9.83em;"/></p>
<p>Let's create a piece of content and reproduce what is in the image. Click <span class="packt_screen">Content</span> in the admin menu, then click the <em><span class="packt_screen">+Add content</span></em> button. When you are presented with the list of content types, click <span class="packt_screen">Article</span>.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Next to the page title, <span class="packt_screen">Create Article</span>, is a star <img src="assets/ba48cd0a-e614-4723-80ab-d0d78cf22b0c.png" style="width:1.25em;height:1.42em;"/>. If you click it, its outline will become colored, which indicates that the current page has been saved as one of your favorites. You can then navigate to the same page in the future simply by clicking <span class="packt_screen">Shortcuts</span> in the admin menu and selecting the page title.</div>
<p>The page contains all the fields and settings necessary for creating Article content. Those fields that require an entry have an asterisk following their name, and I will also include an asterisk as we address each of the fields, in turn.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The <em>Title</em> is a required field for all content because it is used to identify one piece of content as distinct from another, though it does not have to be unique, and so more than one piece of content can have the same title, which quickly becomes confusing. The entry in this field will appear in the summary admin list of content. It is also used as the page title when the content is read on its own page. Therefore, it is best to enter a title that is both meaningful to you and informative to the site visitor. Enter one now. Mine will be <strong>A Moment in the Life of My Dog</strong>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">You might be wondering why the <em>Body</em> field is not required, since the article would be somewhat useless without body text. It is because you might want to create the article as a draft and return later to actually create the body text. This is not possible with the title, because without one, it would be difficult to find the article.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary Field</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Next to the field name is a link that reads <span class="packt_screen">Edit Summary</span>. When creating a content type, the creator decides whether the body text field should accommodate having a separate summary, and if so, that link is shown. The summary is used, for example, when providing a list of content for the site visitor, where a short description of the content—a <em>teaser</em>—is provided.</p>
<p>There are two ways to provide the teaser text: via a separate summary or by trimming, that is, excerpting text from the start of the content. I prefer to use the summary because trimmings are based on a set number of characters that is the same for all of the same type of content, such as the first 40 characters, so I have no control over where the excerpt will end... maybe it will end in the middle of a word. With a summary, I can precisely control what will be shown. Even if it is identical to the start of my body text, I am able to ensure that it ends in an appropriate place.</p>
<p>Click the <em><span class="packt_screen">Edit Summary</span></em> link. A Summary text box will appear above that for the body. It contains a link to hide the field again. This toggle of Edit summary/Hide summary allows you to remove its distraction until you need to use it. You will notice that the bottom right corner of the text box has a widget that's meant to resemble page corners that can be grabbed with the mouse and dragged to enlarge or reduce the size of the text box. It also has a note below it letting you know that if you do not enter summary text into the field, Drupal will use a trimmed version of the body text as a summary. Enter some summary text into the field. Mine will read: <strong>Sasha makes an exciting discovery</strong>.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>You will notice that below the field is a select box that is set to <strong>Basic HTML</strong>. There are two other settings available by default: <strong>Restricted</strong> and <strong>Full</strong>. Not all user roles will necessarily have all settings available. Each setting allows certain HTML tags, which translates to certain formatting of the text. For more information, click the <em>About text formats</em> link.</span></div>

            <article>
                
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Body</span> field goes the full text of the article. Depending on the text format selected, various buttons are available from the editor for formatting the text. My text looks as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Today Sasha Gabor discovered donuts! They're not exactly healthy diet fare for a dog, but she didn't seem to mind.</em></p>
<p>Enter some text for your article, and format some of it using the <strong>B</strong> (bold) or <em>I</em> (italic) buttons. When you have entered it, click the <span class="packt_screen"><em><span class="packt_screen">Source</span></em></span> button to see what the actual HTML markup looks like. Mine shall look like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;Today Sasha Gabor discovered &lt;strong&gt;donuts&lt;/strong&gt;! They're not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; healthy diet fare for a dog, but she didn't seem to mind.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p>If you ever need to customize the underlying HTML of the body text, this is where you can do it. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Source</span> button again to return to WYSIWYG mode.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Text format</h1>

<p>The <em><span class="packt_screen">Text format</span></em> dropdown is used for selecting the filter that will be used when entering text. Security is a constant concern on websites that accept entry from users, as some bad actors will attempt to enter markup that can cause havoc. Filtering which type of markup is allowed helps to mitigate the potential for trouble. These filters can be defined and configured, and the configuration will, for example, identify which HTML tags will be allowed and which processes will be run (such as HTML correction) and in which order. Filters are assigned to user roles, and a user role can have access to more than one filter. The filters that are included with Drupal and their default configurations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plain text</strong>: No HTML tags will be accepted</li>
<li><strong>Restricted HTML</strong>: A minimal set of HTML <span>such as italics, bold, and headings are typically used for anonymous users (users who are not logged in)</span></li>
<li><strong>Basic HTML</strong>: Similar to Restricted HTML, but usually inclusive of a configuration for WYSISYG toolbar buttons, since the filter is normally used for authenticated (logged in) users who will have access to the editor</li>
<li><strong>Full HTML</strong>: Allows any valid HTML tag, and should be assigned with care</li>
</ul>
<p> This filter will not be included in the dropdown as it is used when no other filters are available.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The <em><span class="packt_screen">Tags</span></em> field is used to include terms related to the content. These terms can be used by users to search for content. Multiple terms should be separated by commas. The field is an auto-complete field, meaning that any existing terms matching the characters typed will be offered for you to click rather than typing the entire term. My tags will be <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>donuts</strong>.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The <em><span class="packt_screen">Image</span></em> field enables choosing a file from the device you are using and uploading it to be stored and associated with the content. The maximum size of the file is given below the field (typically 2 MB) and so are the file types that will be accepted. I'm going to add an image and enter <strong>Sasha and her donut</strong> as alt text. Alt text is used to provide information about the image to those users using a screen reader or some other form of access rather than viewing the image.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">INLINE images versus ATTACHMENT images:<br/>
<br/>
Images that are inserted into the text by way of the WYSIWYG editor are treated as part of the text, while images attached to the content by way of the image upload dialog are considered an independent part of the content, like the title, and their visibility can be configured for various contexts, such as teasers, RSS feeds, and so on.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Published</span> checkbox sets the content's status to be either draft (unchecked) or published (checked). Typically, only editors, admins, and the content's author will be allowed to view the content when in its draft state. The content will not appear in menus or lists to those roles that don't have permission to view it. Let's check the box to publish our content.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>That covers the main fields used to create <em>Article</em> content. There are additional configuration options available via the vertical tabs. Let's take a look at those:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-315 image-border" src="assets/8f47d923-238c-402a-865c-2fd026f59a0c.png" style="width:29.58em;height:42.00em;"/></p>
<p>These additional settings are referred to as metadata, which is information used to describe the content that is not actually part of the content.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>If the content type that you are working with is set for revisions, you can enter a description of the changes you have made to the content in this box, and that description will be saved and listed when reviewing the available revisions for this content.</p>

<p>Should you want a menu link for this content, checking this box will open a dialog for providing the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Menu link title</span>: The text that appears as a link</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Description</span>: The text shown when the mouse hovers over the link</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Parent item</span>: The menu link under which this one will be indented</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Weight</span>: A value which determines the position of this menu item in relation to any others (based on their weights) with the same parent</li>

<p>When a new piece of content is created, it is assigned a sequential numeric ID known as the  node ID, or NID. By default, the URL displayed when the content is presented, similar to <kbd>http://mysite.com/node/123</kbd>, where 123 is the NID. If you want your content to have a more meaningful URL than node/123, such as sasha-discovers-donuts, that custom URL, known as an alias, can be defined here.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span><span>When an alias is defined for content, the original URL will still be available for use. You will be able to reach this content using either form of the URL, e.g. https://mysite.com/node/123 or https://mysite.com/my-friendly-content-name.</span></span></div>

<p>Content can be "promoted" to a higher status for the purposes of including it on the home page, or even featuring it there.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Promoted to front page</span>: Some sites determine what content is displayed on the front page by selecting only that content that has been promoted.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Sticky at top of lists</span>: If the content is Sticky, it will stay on the homepage while other content is replaced with newer content. This is a good way to have a welcome message remain while other content is cycled.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, we are ready to save our new content by clicking the <em><span class="packt_screen">Save</span></em> button. After doing so, the content is displayed for you to see. Note the URL that is shown. In my case, it is <em>node/2</em>. I would rather have something more meaningful for the user and for good SEO, so I will click the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab and navigate to the vertical tab for <em><span class="packt_screen">URL PATH SETTINGS</span></em>. There, I will enter <kbd>/sasha-discovers-donuts</kbd> (the initial slash is required) and save the article again. Now, the browser will show my improved URL. I can still use the original URL of node/2. It has not been removed. Create a better URL for your content in the same way.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-316 image-border" src="assets/e45202d8-f336-47cf-8761-6ea4dad53a2e.png" style="width:40.67em;height:34.75em;"/></p>
<p>You will notice that one of the tabs above your article reads <em><span class="packt_screen">Revisions</span></em>. Click it. Because the Article content type is configured to create revisions when saved, and we did not override that by unchecking the <span class="packt_screen">Create new revision</span> checkbox, the change we made and saved in order to improve our URL resulted in the change being saved as a new version rather than simply overwriting the original one. In this manner, we could create a new revision every time we edit the content. From this Revisions page, we can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>View a list of the previous versions</li>
<li>View a previous version</li>
<li>Delete a previous version</li>
<li>Revert to (restore) an earlier version, foregoing the changes made since</li>
</ul>

<p>This brings us to the end of this chapter. Here, we have learned how to create content, use the WYSIWYG editor, configure various options for the content, publish it, make it sticky, save it, edit it, change its URL, and work with revisions.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn to make Drupal even more useful by extending it with add-on modules.</p>
