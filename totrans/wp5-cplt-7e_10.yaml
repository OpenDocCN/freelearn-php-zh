- en: At this stage, you already know how versatile WordPress is when it comes to
    the range of designs you can have on your site—all because of themes. However,
    just getting a theme and using it as is isn't necessarily the most optimized approach.
    Therefore, in this chapter, we're going to take it up a notch—you'll learn how
    to customize your theme and make your website look exactly as you want it to.

- en: We'll start by discussing how to manage navigation menus and work with the basic
    layout customization features to further enhance the capabilities of your entire
    website. Then, we'll talk about widgets and how to use them to make your sidebars
    even more functional and reader-friendly. We'll cover the topic of WordPress Customizer,
    and what it can do for your overall website presentation. Lastly, we'll talk about
    Google AMP and how to make sure that your site is more than optimized to be viewed
    on mobile devices.

    readers find things. A classic website menu is one displayed near the top of the
    page, listing individual sub-pages that are part of the website. Those very often
    are pages such as *About*, and *Contact*. Under the hood, menus are just simple
    lists of links that point to different areas within your website.

    You can easily create menus featuring links to pages, posts, category archives,
    and even arbitrary links to any URL. And when you're done configuring the menu
    itself, you can add it to be displayed in your design/theme.

    always a good idea to experiment with the settings there, and find out on your

    latest posts (in this mode, the home page is just a classic listing of your latest
    blog posts; this is the default setting that you're probably used to) and a new
    setting labeled, A static page. That second one gives you the possibility to set
    whatever page you wish as the home page of your website. You can either select
    an existing page from the dropdown list under Homepage or create a new page by
    clicking on the + Add New Page link.

    Pages, Media, and Importing/Exporting Content*, what we did there was create a
    new page and set it as the custom home page for the site. We called the page Home—quite
    fittingly. It's important to remember that any page that you assign as your home
    page still remains an otherwise normal page, meaning that you can edit it like
    any other page via the Pages section of `wp-admin`.

- en: Apart from the Homepage, there's also another block here, labeled Posts page.
    If you change your home page to a static one, it's always a good idea to assign
    a new Posts page as well. Since the classic listing of your latest posts will
    no longer be displayed on the home page, the new Posts page is meant to handle
    this task from now on. As with the home page, you can select an existing page
    to serve as the new posts page, or create a new one.

- en: In this case, however, it's actually more convenient to create a completely
    new page rather than picking an existing one. You can call yours BLOG or another
    similar name that conveys the page's purpose. What's interesting about this page
    is that you don't need to edit it manually or place any content on it. WordPress
    will populate this page with content on its own, so the only thing you need to
    do is just create it, and that's it.

    sidebar to give you a bigger canvas when adjusting your website), the *desktop
    view* icon, the *tablet view* icon, and the *mobile view* icon. Those final three
    icons are particularly important. These days, more people tend to browse the web
    on their mobile devices than on classic desktop computers. Because of that, it's
    crucially important for you to make sure that your website displays properly on
    those devices. These three icons—the desktop view icon, the tablet view icon,
    and the mobile view icon, allow you to do just that. When you click on any of
    them, the whole Customizer window will change in size to emulate the display mode
    on tablets and mobile devices. Switching back and forth between the modes, you
    can make sure that your site looks great on all devices. We will expand on the
    topic of mobile optimization in the very next part of this chapter.

    a lot of websites were incredibly poorly optimized for mobile viewing. Back in
    the day, mobile wasn't so important, since the technology didn't allow for effective
    media consumption on a mobile phone. However, with the introduction of smartphones,
    this all changed. Nowadays, more people access the web on mobile than on desktops
    and laptops combined.

    mobile-friendly isn''t the easiest of tasks. If your theme/design didn''t come
    as mobile-optimized out of the box, retrofitting mobile on top of it can prove
    difficult. AMP provides an easier solution. Instead of forcing you to rebuild
    parts of your site manually, you can install an add-on AMP module, and have it
    done automatically. What you get as a result is an AMP version of your website.
    This new version will be displayed only to your mobile visitors. Here''s what
    makes AMP a good idea:'
