    websites. The best part is that you can do all of this without losing your shirt
    along the way. Moreover, once you get some practice, you will be able to launch
    new WordPress sites within minutes (that''s not a metaphor, by the way; this is
    as true as it gets).'

    and so on), but a simple plain text editor is all that's required. You may like
    to run a local copy of WordPress on your computer, in which case you may need
    a server such as Apache and MySQL installed (though WAMP, XAMPP, or MAMP can take
    care of all that for you). But even this is not necessary, as you could do the
    entire thing remotely.
