    Control Panel, you are ready to begin altering some more advanced aspects of the
    forum’s appearance and features. Changing these areas of phpBB will be essential
    for giving your forum a unique identity that stands out among online forums. The
    appearance of a forum is mainly controlled by phpBB’s styling system, which manages
    the colors, images, and visual layout of the forum. Features can be added, removed,
    or altered by installing modification scripts downloaded from phpBB-related websites.

    in each forum. They may use different colors and images, display features in a
    different order, or omit some features entirely. This multitude of effects can
    be accomplished by using different phpBB styles. A phpBB **style** is the appearance
    of a forum, created by a combination of a layout, colors, and images. When you
    installed phpBB, the default style, called subSilver, was also installed. subSilver
    is the most commonly used style on phpBB forums, but there are well over two hundred
    different styles that have been publicly released. It is common for forums to
    have multiple styles available for user selection.

    template used interchangeably. In this chapter, themes and templates are defined
    as two smaller aspects of the overall style to reduce confusion. This is the way
    the terms are used most often in phpBB’s code and Administration Control Panel.
    Even the latter sometimes uses theme in place of style, however.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to effectively customize a style, you must first understand the parts
    that compose the design of that style. Styles, like houses, are built from smaller
    components that work together to create a frame. That frame, like the walls of
    the house, provides a structure for displaying the internal contents of a forum.
    These frames can be very complex creations so let us look at how the basic pieces
    are put together and stored, before we get into the actual customization of a
    style.

- en: Style Elements
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Styles are composed of three primary **style elements**, or smaller portions
    that work together to create the overall visual appearance of the style. These
    are the template, theme, and image set elements. Each style is self-contained
    and includes all the style elements needed to operate correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first and most important part of a style is the template element. The **template
    element** is a set of text files containing the entire markup that is used to
    generate the visual layout of a forum. The **markup** consists mainly of a markup
    language such as **Hypertext Markup Language** (**HTML**) and phpBB’s own special
    template features, but can also include client-side scripting languages such as
    JavaScript. Template files are used to arrange most of the information displayed
    by your forum. You can identify template files by looking at the name of a file;
    all template files have names ending with `tpl`. Some examples are `index_body.tpl,
    viewtopic_body.tpl`, and `message_body.tpl`. Although this is rare, it is possible
    for multiple styles to use one set of template files with different themes and/or
    image sets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **theme** element of a forum style is a grouping of formatting rules used
    to define the visual decoration of a forum. The most common uses of the theme
    are specifying the font face, colors, background colors, and borders of page elements.
    Theme elements can be difficult to locate because they can be stored in three
    different locations. Most styles store theme data in one or more **Cascading Style
    Sheet** (**CSS**) files, such as `subSilver.css` and `formIE.css`. The name of
    the CSS files will vary with each forum style, but many times, there will be at
    least one CSS file named after the forum style. Some styles will place their CSS
    formatting rules in the `overall_header.tpl` template file instead of a separate
    CSS file. Others may use a combination of the `overall_header.tpl` technique and
    database storage of some values. The subSilver style uses the combination method,
    but also includes a CSS file that can be used after a manual change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An **image set** element includes all the images that are part of a style. Some
    examples are the folder images, voting result bar graphics, and language-specific
    buttons such as "Reply" and "New Topic." There are also images that may be used
    mainly for decorative purposes, such as background or header images. Decorative
    images are sometimes considered part of the theme, instead of the image set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the template files already discussed, the template element can
    also contain two special configuration files related to the theme and image set
    elements. The theme configuration file, `theme_info.cfg`, is used for saving theme
    database data associated with a template. The saved data can then be imported
    into another forum’s database later. For the most part, you will only rarely need
    to edit this file. It is usually automatically generated or provided as needed.
    The second configuration file holds template configuration data. In most cases,
    that will merely be a list of graphic files in the image set of a style. These
    template configuration files have a name based on their matching template, such
    as `subSilver.cfg`.

    SQL database. The database only holds a list of installed styles, the name of
    an associated template element for each style, and some limited theme data. No
    image set data is stored in your database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, style elements are stored in the `templates` directory of
    the forum file system. The `templates` directory contains subdirectories that
    are named uniquely and after each individual set of template files. Each subdirectory
    of `templates` will contain template, theme, image set, and configuration files
    for one or more styles. Until new styles are installed or created, the only subdirectory
    in `templates` will be `subSilver`.
  prefs: []

    `admin` and `images`. The `admin` subdirectory will contain template files used
    to display the Administration Control Panel. The `images` subdirectory will hold
    the image set used in the style, and may have language-named subdirectories, such
    as `lang_english` or `lang_dutch`, for images that display typed text in different
    languages. Some more advanced styles may include directories other than `admin`
    and `images`.'

    will be very useful to you as the administrator of a phpBB forum. You have already
    learned about some of the powerful configurations and features available through
    the Administration Control Panel, but there are many more that are not found there.
    These features can only be accessed (or in some cases, added) by editing phpBB’s
    files yourself. You must be careful to follow proper procedures when altering
    the files because phpBB is a delicate and complicated set of scripts. Doing so
    can save you a lot of headaches later, as many have learned first hand.

    backup of that file. This simply means creating a copy of the file in its current
    condition. If you encounter problems due to your editing later, you can replace
    the edited file with the backup. That will effectively revert your forum to the
    pre-edited state of the file. At some point in your phpBB experience, you will
    definitely need to use a backup of a file. Everyone makes mistakes at some point,
    and it is nothing to be ashamed about. At other times, things simply do not work.
    Regardless of the cause, very few mistakes can be permanently fatal to a phpBB
    forum if you make backups before doing anything.

    phpBB uses three types of files: graphics, text files containing program code,
    and text files containing display code. **Graphics** are standard image files
    you would see on any website and should be edited in programs such as Jasc Paint
    Shop Pro, Adobe Photoshop, or any other program capable of handling them. The
    text files, however, are special. Making a mistake in a graphic file will not
    damage your forum, but making one in a display code file or program code can easily
    cripple your forum.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of phpBB’s **program code files** contain the essential scripting needed
    to operate and display all aspects of a phpBB-powered forum and website. They
    are the backbone of phpBB. These files may have filename extensions of `.php,
    .inc`, or `.cfg`, and are plain text files created in a Unix text file format.
    This mainly means that when editing the files, you need to use a program capable
    of understanding the Unix text format. The majority of simple text-editing software
    will have no problems with this. Microsoft Notepad, perhaps the most commonly
    used text editor of the Microsoft Windows operating system, cannot understand
    the Unix format fully. It displays all the contents of a Unix text file on one
    long line, so Notepad is not the best choice for phpBB administrators. WordPad
    editor, also included with Microsoft Windows, is able to read Unix files without
    any problems. Most dedicated phpBB coders use more advanced text-editing programs
    with special features related to the PHP programming language. Some popular examples
    are EditPlus, TextPad, and PHPEdit, but there are many more available. You should,
    however, not need anything more complex than WordPad for the examples here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **display code files** are the `.tpl` files of the template element and
    the `.css` files of the theme element we learned about earlier. Like the program
    code files, these are plain text files saved in a Unix text file format. WordPad
    will again be our choice for editing these files for the examples in this chapter.
    There are special HTML editing programs, such as Dreamweaver MX, that can be used
    to edit template files. Those programs tend to cause as many problems as they
    solve, so you may want to avoid them for now unless you are very familiar with
    the program you choose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, there is one more note about editing both program and display code
    files. When saving these files, you need to make certain to save them in the proper
    file format. These are supposed to be plain text files, so you must save them
    as that. To save an edited phpBB file in WordPad, just click the **Save** toolbar
    icon or select **Save** from the **File** menu. WordPad should automatically save
    the file correctly. If you must select **Save As**, make certain to choose **Text
    Document** in the **Saves as type** selection list.

    `templates` directory. The easiest way to create a new style is to copy the files
    of another and make a few changes to some of the copied files. These files are
    the configuration files, such as `subSilver.cfg` and `theme_info.cfg`, which phpBB
    uses for installing and managing styles. The Cascading Style Sheet file, `subSilver.css`
    in this case, was also renamed. As a result, references to `subSilver.css` in
    `overall_header.tpl` also had to be changed to the new name of that file. Completing
    these steps gives you a new style, which you can edit as much as you like without
    affecting your forums’ other styles.

    is only one of the ways in which we can alter the appearance of a phpBB, however.
    Two of our other options are creating a completely new style or customizing one
    already installed, like subSilver. Both of these options have some benefits and
    some drawbacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating a new style can really bring life to a forum. If your forum has a look
    that is unlike any other, your visitors are more likely to remember it. You probably
    remember some of the unique-looking websites you have visited in the past yourself.
    Also, you do not have to spend time looking through hundreds of existing styles
    for something you like or one that will fit nicely with the subject matter of
    your forum. Sometimes you may not even be able to find a style appropriate to
    your subject! The temptation to create your own style is great.

- en: On the other hand, creating a new style is a lot of work! There are many graphics
    required for normal phpBB operations, and you will probably want to replace most
    of them with your own. You may even want to create new graphics and alter the
    template files to create new visual effects. Essentially, you would be designing
    an entire website. If you are not an experienced web designer or graphic artist,
    you may find the task to be a bit beyond your current skill level.

    a new one. The existing structure will already be complete, other than any changes
    you want to make. You can quickly replace any images or colors to alter the mood
    of the forum, as you will see later in this chapter. The work of the original
    style creator will serve as a guideline to help you develop your knowledge. Then
    again, if you customize a style, that same existing structure will limit you unless
    changed greatly. Chances are that the customized style will bear some resemblance
    to the original, and many people will know that at first glance.

    the look of a forum. There is a good chance you can find an existing style to
    customize that will not limit you too much. If you look at enough styles, however,
    you will find that many of them are based, at least in part, on the original subSilver
    style. For something unique, you will have to create a new style.

- en: The quickest way to overhaul the look of a forum is to change its colors, fonts,
    and other visual (but non-graphical) decorations. When we looked at the basic
    elements of a style earlier, we learned that a theme defines and controls these
    concepts through the formatting rules of a **Cascading Style Sheet** (**CSS**).
    CSS formatting rules add stylistic data, such as specifications for fonts, colors,
    sizes, borders, and spacing to a document structured with a markup language like
    HTML. Since phpBB creates documents of this kind to display a forum, the preferred
    method for changing these parts of the outward appearance of the forum is CSS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such as `subBook.css`, in `overall_header.tpl`, or in a combination of the `overall_header.tpl`

    therefore subBook will also do the same.'

    be used with the names of existing files in the `templates` directory of a style.
    It is possible to use a file that is not in a `templates` subdirectory, but this
    often requires some editing of multiple template files. Some styles, including
    subSilver, will not use one or both of this pair when first installed. Make sure
    a value is filled in for **CSS Stylesheet** regardless, as you may find yourself
    needing it later. **Background Image** is optional.

    called HTML color codes, are combinations of six letters and numbers that represent
    a color, usually prefaced with a pound symbol (`#`). Many websites provide charts
    and lists that show examples of these codes. When entering a hexadecimal color
    code into the color settings of this page, you must not include the pound symbol.
    The color settings will accept only six character values, so including the pound
    will cause the last character of the code to be cut off! That can lead to some
    weird color effects. You may be tempted to enter a color name, such as red or
    green, for the color settings. If you do so, however, you will get some strange
    results. Lists of the different hexadecimal codes are available on many websites.
    Two good lists can be found at [http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutors/colors.html](http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutors/colors.html)

    These will usually be related to a font size in pixel or point measurements, but

    percentage measurements, you may want to leave these settings alone until you
    have determined the type of units used in the stylesheet.

    in the list, place it inside single or double quotes: for example, **‘Verdana’,
    ‘Trebuchet MS’**. You can also use a single name, but it is a better idea to use
    a list. When a list is provided, the first font that is installed on the viewer’s

    class names** are names of Cascading Style Sheet formatting rules. They will usually

    used. Any aspect of phpBB that displays data in table rows, such as the member
    list, forums, and topics, can use these elements to achieve an alternating row
    color effect. For compatibility with phpBB’s internal coding, **Table Cell Class
    1** often has a value of **row1** and **Table Cell Class 2** a value of **row2**.

    the `.bodyline` class. This would be on a single line about eight lines below
    the `body` class. Near the end of the line, you can see the `border` property,
    which manages the border around the forum pages. It should currently have values
    that create a solid, one pixel wide, light blue border, with the color changeable
    in **Edit Theme**. Now, replace the word `solid` with `dashed`. Save this change
    and look at your forum’s index page—it now has a dashed line for a border. You
    can also try `dotted, ridge`, and `groove` for some other effects. By altering
    the number portion of the `1px` code in the same area, you can increase and decrease
    the width of the border. Try `10px` and `dotted` together for an unusual view.

- en: By placing a stylesheet in `overall_header.tpl`, phpBB gives you a lot of control
    through the **Edit Theme** page, but it comes at a cost. The stylesheet has to
    be freshly loaded on every page, and this can slow down a very busy forum. An
    alternative is to use an external stylesheet file, such as `subSilver.css` and
    `subBook.css`. Web browsers do not refresh external stylesheets as often, resulting
    in smaller page sizes and faster loading times. This type of stylesheet does not
    support the **Edit Theme** utility, however, so the utility is rendered almost
    useless. **Edit Theme** will still control administrator and moderator username
    colors and, depending on the style, row classes and colors.

    the existing image, and putting the new image in the same location. This is a
    quick way of getting new graphics on your forum, but it will limit you to the
    same type of image previously in place. If you have a JPEG image, like a digital
    photo, that you want to use for a **New Topic** button in subSilver or subBook,
    you would have to convert it to a GIF image, losing some picture quality in the

    changes to the database. Modification authors will include these changes using
    one or more of three methods. The first method, and most popular in more recently
    created modifications, is to include an installer script file. Installer files
    are special files with a `.php` filename extension that can make database changes
    for you. They are typically named `install.php` or `db_update.php`, but the name
    can have some variety. To use these files, you normally only need to place them
    in your forum’s directory structure (the Copy action handles that) and run the
    file.
  prefs: []

    often ask, "What does it mean to *run* the file?" To run a `.php` file, you need
    to visit it in your web browser like a normal web page. A good comparison comes
    from thinking of your forum’s `viewtopic.php`, which displays all topics. Every
    time you read a topic in the forum, you are running the `viewtopic.php` file.
    Just visiting your uploaded `db_update.php` file will begin the process of editing
    the database. Some complicated installers may walk you through several steps.

    commands in the installation instructions under an SQL action. The third method
    places the same kind of list in a separate text file, which might be named `sql.txt`
    or `schema.sql`. Other names are possible, but the important thing to note is
    that any file with an extension of `.sql` is a text file containing SQL queries.
    When either of these two methods is used, you will need to do one of two things:
    create your own installer script or run the changes manually.'

    First, several versions of phpBB have been released. Each version has certain
    code changes, so phpBB 2.0 will have some modifications for early releases where
    the Find code is very different than the code in the latest version. In these
    cases, it is often best if you do not install the modification unless the relevant
    changes between versions seem minor. Another problem is that some modifications
    try to find code that has been changed, or even removed, by other modifications
    already. Some authors have tried to bypass this problem by only listing the first
    few characters of each line to find. That practice has created yet another problem
    due to misinterpretation of the actions that follow Find instructions. Finally,
    some lines of code appear more than once in some files. You may need to edit only
    a specific appearance or all instances.

    Add actions, the code following the action should be placed into the file on a
    line before the code of the Find action. For After, Add actions, the codes go

    place the new code on a new line, separate from all other code*. Some modification
    authors, as has been mentioned, include only partial lines of code in their Find
    actions. The problem with this practice is that modification users tend to add
    new code right after that in a Find action, on the same line. This places new
    code right in the middle of the original code, creating a series of syntax errors
    that can make a forum inaccessible. If you always add code before or after Find
    code by inserting it on a completely new line, you should be able to avoid this

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One very important aspect of modification installation remains, just when you
    thought you had finished it. When you install modifications, you will see that
    almost all of those modifying or adding template files will only mention the subSilver
    template in their instructions. By this time, you should have installed at least
    one other template on your forum. With so many templates existing, it is not practical
    for authors to mention all of them in their instructions. Since every phpBB forum
    has subSilver installed at some point, and many templates are built from subSilver,
    only that one template gets mentioned, with an unspoken understanding that it
    is really a reference to all templates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The trouble with templates is that you have to install every modification’s
    template file changes to all your installed templates, even though the instructions
    do not tell you to do this. Also, if you install modifications and later install
    new templates, you have to apply the modifications to those templates. Should
    you forget to modify a template, any forum members using that template will not
    be able to access the modification’s features unless they switch to another that
    you did edit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another problem in this area is the code of the templates themselves. While
    many templates are created from subSilver, quite a few are not. The latter kinds
    tend to have some very different markup language coding in their files. It can
    seem nearly impossible to locate code in a Find action unless you break it down
    into individual template variables. You might actually have to rewrite the new
    template files or code to match the look of the alternative templates, too. It
    can be quite a headache.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two methods of removing a modification’s changes to your files. Since
    you created backups before editing any of your files, you can replace your current
    files with those backup copies. This reverts the forum’s files to the same condition
    they were in before the modification was installed. If you have made changes to
    the files other than installing this modification, then you should not restore
    the backup files. Doing so in such a case will cause your other changes to be
    lost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second method is to go through the modification’s instructions as if installing,
    but invert the action commands. For example, if the instructions have a Find action
    followed by an After, Add action, you would locate and delete the After, Add code.
    In the case of a Find and Replace With combination, you would search for the Replace
    With code, remove it, and place the Find code at that location. To further illustrate
    these concepts, the following example removes the **Search** button added to posts
