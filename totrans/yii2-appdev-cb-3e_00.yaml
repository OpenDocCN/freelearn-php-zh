- en: Yii is a free, open source web application development framework, written in
    PHP5, that promotes clean DRY design and encourages rapid development. It works
    to streamline your application development time and helps to ensure an extremely
    efficient, extensible, and maintainable end product. Being extremely performance-optimized,
    Yii is a perfect choice for any size project. However, it has been built with
    sophisticated, enterprise applications in mind. You have full control over the
    configuration from head-to-toe (presentation-to-persistence) to conform to your
    enterprise development guidelines. It comes packaged with tools to help test and
    debug your application, and has clear and comprehensive documentation.

- en: This book is a collection of Yii2 recipes. Each recipe is represented as a full
    and independent item, which showcases solutions from real web applications. So
    you can easily reproduce them in your environment and learn Yii2 fast and without
    tears. All recipes are explained with step-by-step code examples and clear screenshots.
    Yii2 is like a suit that looks great off the rack, but is also very easy to tailor
    to fit your needs. Virtually every component of the framework is extensible. This
    book will show how to use official extensions, extend any component, or write
    a new one.

    *Fundamentals*, covers how to install the Yii Framework and different ways to
    install it. We will introduce you to application templates: basic and advanced
    and what is difference between them. Then you will learn about dependency injection
    container. This chapter contains info about model events, which are triggered
    after some simple actions such as model saving and updating and another. We will
    learn how to use external code which will include ZendFramework, Laravel, and
    Sympony in examples. We will also learn how to update your yii-1.x.x based application
    to yii2 step-by-step. A few more recipes are available at [https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/4270OS_Chapter1.pdf](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/4270OS_Chapter1.pdf).'

    that will run smoothly until you have very high loads. Yii is one of the fastest
    frameworks out there. Still, when developing and deploying an application, it
    is good to have some extra performance for free, as well as following best practices
    for the application itself. In this chapter, we will see how to configure Yii
    to gain extra performance. In addition, we will learn some best practices for
    developing an application that will run smoothly until we have very high loads.'

    review logging, analyzing the exception stack trace, and implementing our own
    error handler. It is not possible to create a bug-free application if it is relatively
    complex, so developers have to detect errors and deal with them as fast as possible.
    Yii has a good set of utility features to handle logging and handling errors.
    Moreover, in the debug mode, Yii gives you a stack trace if there is an error.
    Using it, you can fix errors faster.'
