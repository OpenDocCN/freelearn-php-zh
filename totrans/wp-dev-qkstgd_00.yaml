- en: WordPress is the most widely used CMS in the world. As a developer, WordPress
    is the ideal way to share your knowledge with a large community as well as build
    a profitable business. Getting started with WordPress development has been a challenge
    for novice developers, compared to building everything from scratch in other frameworks.
    It's very easy to build WordPress sites by connecting bits and pieces without
    actually knowing what's happening under the hood. Many developers tend to follow
    this path and face maintenance and security nightmares in the long run. This book
    is structured to explain the components used in WordPress development, when and
    where to use them, and why you should be using each component in specific scenarios.

    standards of WordPress. Mastering the built-in database is one of the keys to
    becoming a expert in WordPress development. In this section, you will learn about
    the database structure, and examine the data usage of the built-in features and
    their limitations in order to plan the data needs of your application. Then you
    will move onto an important topic: the theme and plugin development process. In
    this section, you will learn how themes and plugins fit into an application while
    understanding basic to advanced techniques for extending themes and plugins.'

    by WordPress and see how we can leverage them to rapidly build solutions. Next,
    we move onto another essential section, where we explore the techniques for capturing,
    processing, and displaying user data while integrating third-party components
    into the site's design. Finally, you will learn how to test and deploy the application
    with secure and maintainable code, while providing the best performance for end
    users.
