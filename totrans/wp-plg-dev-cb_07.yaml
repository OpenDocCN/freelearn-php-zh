    fields, the next area that we will be making additions to is the user creation
    and edition tool. This type of addition can be used for many different purposes,
    including tracking when users have last visited a site or storing additional data
    on the types of services they are interested in. This chapter expands on the private
    content plugin that we started in Chapter 2, *Plugin Framework Basics* and [Chapter
    3](0346c3c6-27ee-45fb-bfd6-df398e04b2b4.xhtml), *User Settings and Administration
    Pages* in the recipes entitled *Creating a new enclosing shortcode* and *Storing
    stylesheet data in user settings,* by adding a second level of content protection
    that will restrict some posts or pages so that they are only available to paid
    users.

    hook, depending on the nature of your plugin and the additional information to
    be stored. That being said, if you do not register any function with this hook,
    as we are doing in this recipe, you will not see the additional fields created

    of all columns that the system intends on displaying in the users section of the
    administration interface. While we could have just added our new entry at the
    end of the array, similar to what we did in the *Displaying additional columns
    in the custom post list page* recipe in [Chapter 4](6298bc2b-19d5-4e3a-833c-3c4b667b22e5.xhtml),
    *The Power of Custom Post Types*, we take a more advanced approach in this recipe;
    we use the PHP `array_slice` function to split the columns array into two sections
    and insert our new column name between the existing items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We continue this recipe by providing a function that displays the user level
    assigned to each user. This is done by simply retrieving the information based
    on the current user ID and returning the data to be displayed. It should be noted
    that the user management page takes an approach that is slightly different from
    the post and pages custom column content, since it uses a filter function where
    we return data instead of using an action hook that directly sends content to
    the browser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next code section is responsible for rendering a drop-down list of user
    levels that can be used to filter the user list; this is done by using standard
    HTML and code to loop through the list of user levels and display them. Unfortunately,
    WordPress complicates things by calling our function twice, before and after listing
    users, resulting in two drop-down lists on the same page with no way to differentiate
    them. To avoid having issues with the two drop-down lists being set to different
    values and sending these conflicting values to our filtering code, the next function
    places Javascript code in the page footer of all the user listing pages. This
    allows us to synchronize either drop-down list with the other's value when the
    user interacts with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our last step consists of modifying the user query if we find a filtering argument
    in the page URL when displaying the user listing. If an argument is found and
    the page is the correct one, we will check whether the value is part of our user
    levels array and then add it to the system's current query variables.

    metadata that we stored in the previous recipes in this chapter. Alternatively,
    it checks if the user is a site administrator by using the `current_user_can`
    WordPress function and specifying `'activate_plugins'` as the argument, since
    only administrators can perform this action. If all of these conditions are met,
    the enclosed post content will be displayed. Otherwise, a message will be shown
