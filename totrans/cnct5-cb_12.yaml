- en: Most content management systems have plugins or modules of some sort. concrete5
    is fairly unique in that it comes with an entire ecosystem of add-ons and themes.
    This allows add-on developers to earn some money with the packages that they create
    for concrete5, and it also supports the concrete5 team, as concrete5 gets a percentage
    of each add-on that is sold.

- en: There are several rules that your add-on must adhere to. First and foremost,
    your add-on must work. There shouldn't be any errors while installing the add-on
    or while using it. Also, make sure that you own the rights to all of the code
    and assets contained within the add-on, or you have received proper permission
    from the code authors to include their code in your add-on.

- en: Some other rules include using `defined or die` statements at the top of every
    PHP file, including an icon, and making sure to wrap all strings in the global
    `t()` function. Add-on developers are also expected to support their add-on and
    release updates to fix bugs and address customer complaints.

    it to see if it meets the eligibility requirements. Once the add-on passes these
    tests, members of the **Peer Review Board** (**PRB**) will take a look at your
    add-on.

    are responsible for testing every add-on and theme that is submitted to the marketplace.
    They will install your package on their own version of concrete5 and test it fully
    to make sure it will work without difficulties, and to ensure that your add-on
    adheres to the rules.

- en: concrete5 allows developers to sell their add-on. The lowest price you can set
    for an add-on (other than free) is $15 USD. concrete5 will keep 25 percent of
    your add-on's revenue, but the exposure they provide to your add-on by featuring
    it in the marketplace is usually worth a small commission.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you sell an add-on in the concrete5 marketplace, you will be expected to
    support it. If your add-on doesn't work and you do not provide support for it,
    concrete5 will refund the customer and also charge you a 15 percent penalty. Make
    sure you are prepared to invest the time in supporting your add-ons.

    available in the concrete5 marketplace. Be sure to pay attention to customer inquiries
    or support requests. Also, if you are selling your add-on, remember to request
    payments for downloads on a regular basis.
