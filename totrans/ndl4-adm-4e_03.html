<h1 id="_idParaDest-60" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Exploring Courses, Users, and Roles</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">The objective of this chapter is to give you a quick rundown of the underlying foundation of Moodle: courses, users, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and roles.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The three concepts are inherently intertwined, and any one of these cannot be used without the other two. We will deal with the basics of the three core elements and show how they <span class="No-Break" lang="">work together.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Moodle courses</strong> are central to Moodle, as this is <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>where learning takes place. Teachers upload their learning resources, create activities, assist in learning, grade work, monitor progress, and so on. Students, on the other hand, read, listen to, or watch learning resources, participate in activities, submit work, collaborate with others, and so on. You will be introduced to courses and how they are organized in categories. You will also learn about the key components of courses, namely activities <span class="No-Break" lang="">and resources.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Moodle users</strong> are individuals <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>accessing our Moodle system. Typical users are students and teachers/trainers, but there are others such as teaching assistants, managers, parents, assessors, examiners, or guests. Oh, and the administrator, of course! We will cover the basic concepts of authentication – how to get access to Moodle – and enrolment – how to get access to a course – before briefly dealing with two different types of user collections: cohorts <span class="No-Break" lang="">and groups.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Moodle roles</strong> are, effectively, permissions<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> that specify which features users can access, and where and when (in Moodle) they can access them. You will become familiar with the concepts of roles, contexts, and capabilities, which are essential for controlling permissions <span class="No-Break" lang="">in Moodle.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Bear in mind that this chapter only covers the basic concepts of these three core elements. The dedicated chapters – <a href="B18779_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Managing Courses and Enrolments</em>, <a href="B18779_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Managing Users, Cohorts, and Authentication</em>, and <a href="B18779_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 6</em></span></a>,<em class="italic" lang=""> Managing Permissions, Roles, and Capabilities</em> – will deal with the three concepts in <span class="No-Break" lang="">greater detail.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">In this chapter, we will be covering <span class="No-Break" lang="">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">A high-level overview of core <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle concepts</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Exploring <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle courses</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Exploring <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle users</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Exploring <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle roles</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">By the end of the chapter, you will have a good understanding of Moodle’s three core concepts: courses, users, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and roles.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-61" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>A high-level overview of core Moodle concepts</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Let’s look at the following<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> diagram to give you an overview of courses, users, and roles. It shows how central the three concepts are and how other features are related to them. Again, all their intricacies will be dealt with in due course, so for now, just start getting familiar with some <span class="No-Break" lang="">Moodle terminology.</span></p>

<img alt="Figure 3.1 – Core Moodle concepts " height="610" src="image/Figure_3.01_B18779.jpg" width="609"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Core Moodle concepts</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Let’s start at the bottom left and cycle through the pyramid in a roughly clockwise fashion. Users have to go through an <strong class="bold" lang="">Authentication</strong> process to get access to Moodle. They then have to go through the <strong class="bold" lang="">Enrolments</strong> step to participate in <strong class="bold" lang="">Courses</strong>, which themselves are organized into <strong class="bold" lang="">Categories</strong>. <strong class="bold" lang="">Groups &amp; Cohorts</strong> are different ways to group users at course level or site-wide, respectively. <strong class="bold" lang="">Users</strong> are granted <strong class="bold" lang="">Roles</strong>, in particular, <strong class="bold" lang="">Contexts</strong>, which are ring-fenced Moodle areas; the scope of the role is specified by <span class="No-Break" lang="">configuring </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Permissions</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The diagram also demonstrates a chicken-and-egg situation. If we start with users, we have no courses to<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> enrol them on; if we start with courses, we have no users who can participate in them. Not to worry, though – Moodle lets us go back and forth between administrative areas and often perform multiple <span class="No-Break" lang="">tasks simultaneously.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">A short note on the <strong class="bold" lang="">enrol vs enroll</strong> lingua <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>dispute that appears to be as old as Moodle itself. While this book has to be written in US English, we decided to use the British English spelling for the term for two main reasons: first, in Moodle internally, <em class="italic" lang="">enrolment </em>is used throughout – for example, as a parameter in batch files – and second, Moodle Docs use <em class="italic" lang="">enrol</em> (Moodle is Australian after all). So, <em class="italic" lang="">enrol</em> and <em class="italic" lang="">enrolment</em> it is! Switch to the <strong class="bold" lang="">en_us</strong> language pack if this drives you mad. Or crazy. <span class="No-Break" lang="">Or both.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Now that you have been given a high-level overview, let’s start with the top corner of our triangle, dealing <span class="No-Break" lang="">with courses.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-62" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Exploring Moodle courses</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Courses are central to Moodle, as<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> this is where content is presented to learners and most of the learning and collaboration <span class="No-Break" lang="">takes place.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">In the following sections, first, we will cover the two most essential learning elements of courses: resources and activities. Then, we will look at categories that organize courses hierarchically. Finally, you are going to create your <span class="No-Break" lang="">first course.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">Moodle is a <span class="No-Break" lang="">course-centric system.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-63" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Resources and activities</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle manages activities and stores resources in courses, and this is where the vast majority of learning <span class="No-Break" lang="">takes place:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Resources</strong> are learning elements <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>where the learner is passive – for instance, a PDF <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>document can be read, a URL can be navigated to, a podcast can be listened to, or a video can <span class="No-Break" lang="">be watched</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Activities</strong> are learning <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>elements where the learner is active and more <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>engaged – for example, posting to a discussion forum, responding to a feedback questionnaire, collaborating with others to author FAQs, or answering questions in a <span class="No-Break" lang="">SCORM-based quiz</span></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">Resources and activities can be arranged in any order, and dependencies can be specified via a combination of access restrictions and activity completion criteria. To illustrate the workings of the sequencing versus non-sequencing of content, let’s look at a sample blended learning course. In our example, this comprises three phases (called topics in Moodle), but any other <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>structure would be possible: <em class="italic" lang="">preparation</em> (pre-seminar), <em class="italic" lang="">webinar</em> (face-to-face), and <span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">follow-up</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> (post-seminar):</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer053">
<img alt="Figure 3.2 – Sample course content " height="866" src="image/Figure_3.02_B18779.jpg" width="1392"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Sample course content</p>
<p lang="en-GB">During the preparation section, participants <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>are welcome to read the provided PDF document and watch a motivational video. They are also asked to introduce themselves in a forum, so attendees can start networking before the event. While the first two activities are optional, the introduction is compulsory and a prerequisite for attending the seminar. The trainer must mark the webinar activity off before access to the handouts is granted. The follow-up comprises four activities: a certain percentage has to be achieved in the quiz to complete the assessment, and the feedback questionnaire has to be submitted before the diploma (via a third-party plugin) is issued. Access to the alumni forum will only be granted when all three activities have <span class="No-Break" lang="">been completed.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-64" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Course categories</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Categories act as containers for courses, and they can have subcategories, sub-subcategories, and so on. The<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> hierarchical arrangement is similar to that of files and folders on your computer, where categories are like folders and courses are <span class="No-Break" lang="">like files:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer054">
<img alt="Figure 3.3 – Categories, courses, activities, and resources " height="643" src="image/Figure_3.03_B18779.jpg" width="1177"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Categories, courses, activities, and resources</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Moodle comes with a default category called <strong class="bold" lang="">Category 1</strong>, which is sufficient to show the basics of courses. We will <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>deal with categories in more detail in <a href="B18779_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 4</em></span></a>,<em class="italic" lang=""> Managing Courses </em><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">and Enrolments</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">A course always belongs to a category. It cannot belong to multiple categories and cannot be without <span class="No-Break" lang="">a category.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-65" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Creating a Moodle course</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The quickest way to create a<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> new course is via <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Courses</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Add a new course</strong>. For now, let’s focus on the two compulsory fields, namely <strong class="bold" lang="">Course full name</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Course </strong><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">short name</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">:</span></p>
<ol>
<li lang="en-GB">Enter a course full name (here, we used <strong class="source-inline" lang="">Algorithms &amp; Data Structures I</strong>), which is displayed at various places <span class="No-Break" lang="">in Moodle.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Enter a course short name (here, we used <strong class="source-inline" lang="">ALGDS1</strong>), which is used by default to identify <span class="No-Break" lang="">the course.</span></li>
</ol>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer055">
<img alt="Figure 3.4 – Creating a Moodle course " height="997" src="image/Figure_3.04_B18779.jpg" width="857"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – Creating a Moodle course</p>
<p lang="en-GB">You can also see the already <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>mentioned default course category, <strong class="bold" lang="">Category 1</strong>. To change its name or add other categories and subcategories, you need to select the respective option in the menu at <span class="No-Break" lang="">the top.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">For now, we will leave all the other fields empty or at their default values and save the course by clicking on the <strong class="bold" lang="">Save and display</strong> button at the bottom. The displayed screen shows the skeleton of the course without any content, except an <span class="No-Break" lang="">announcement forum.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">When you select the <strong class="bold" lang="">Participants</strong> tab, you<a id="_idIndexMarker172"/> will see that your account has already been added. Moodle does this automatically. However, we cannot add any further learners to the course yet, since we haven’t added any users to our system. Let’s rectify this situation by adding some users before returning to <span class="No-Break" lang="">this screen.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-66" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Exploring Moodle users</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Each user in Moodle is represented as a <strong class="bold" lang="">user account</strong>, which contains information about the person’s profile. In the <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>following subsections, we will briefly explain the difference between user authentication and enrolment before creating your first user account(s) and enroling these users in <span class="No-Break" lang="">a course.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-67" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Authentication and enrolment</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Before we start, it is vital to <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>understand the difference between authentication and enrolment. Users must be authenticated to log in to Moodle, and <strong class="bold" lang="">authentication</strong> grants <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>your users access to the system through a login where a username and password must be given. Moodle supports a significant number of authentication mechanisms, such as MS-AD, LDAP, and SAML. For now, let’s work with so-called manual authentication to simplify overall <span class="No-Break" lang="">user management.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold" lang="">Enrolment</strong> happens at a <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>course level. However, a user must be authenticated on the system before enrolment on a course can take place. The house and key analogy might help: you need a key (authentication) to the house (Moodle), and you then need a separate key (enrolment) for each <span class="No-Break" lang="">room (course).</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">So, a typical workflow is as follows (there are exceptions as always, but this will do <span class="No-Break" lang="">for now):</span></p>
<ol>
<li lang="en-GB" value="1">Create your courses (<span class="No-Break" lang="">and categories)</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Create <span class="No-Break" lang="">user accounts</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Associate users with courses and <span class="No-Break" lang="">assign roles</span></li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-GB">Again, this sequence demonstrates nicely how intertwined courses, users, and roles are in Moodle. Another way of looking at the difference between authentication and enrolment is how a user will <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>get access to a course. Please bear in mind that this is a very simplistic view that ignores supported features such as external authentication, guest access, <span class="No-Break" lang="">and self-enrolment:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer056">
<img alt="Figure 3.5 – Authentication and enrolment " height="455" src="image/Figure_3.05_B18779.jpg" width="1390"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.5 – Authentication and enrolment</p>
<p lang="en-GB">During the authentication phase, a user enters their credentials (username and password), or they are entered automatically via single sign-on. The user is granted access if the account exists locally – that is, within Moodle – and the password is valid. The check will be carried out remotely if the account is held externally – for instance, in an <span class="No-Break" lang="">active directory.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Once this is successful, the next phase is enrolment. If the user is enroled and the enrolment hasn’t expired, access is granted to the course where resources and activities can be worked through. As mentioned before, this graphic only shows the very basics, but for now, it hopefully demonstrates the difference between authentication and enrolment. You will come across a more detailed version of these graphics in <a href="B18779_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Managing Courses and Enrolments</em>, when we deal with various <span class="No-Break" lang="">enrolment methods.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-68" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Adding a user account</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">To add a user account manually, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Users</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang=""> Add a new user</strong>. As with courses, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>only focus on the mandatory fields, which should <span class="No-Break" lang="">be self-explanatory:</span></p>
<ol>
<li lang="en-GB" value="1">Provide a <span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">unique</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> username.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Set a new password. If a password policy has been set, certain rules <span class="No-Break" lang="">might apply.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Enter the user’s first name <span class="No-Break" lang="">and surname.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Provide the user’s email address. It must be unique, although there are ways around <span class="No-Break" lang="">this restriction.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Ensure you save the account information by selecting <strong class="bold" lang="">Create user</strong> at the bottom of <span class="No-Break" lang="">the page:</span></li>
</ol>

<p lang="en-GB">Here, a few more accounts <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>were created via batch upload, which will be dealt with in <a href="B18779_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Managing Users, Cohorts, and Authentication</em>. To see who has access to your Moodle system, select <strong class="bold" lang="">Users</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Browse list of users</strong> from the <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> menu, where you will see <span class="No-Break" lang="">all users:</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">Now that we have a few <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>users on our system, let’s go back to the course we created earlier and manually enrol <span class="No-Break" lang="">new participants.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-69" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Enroling users</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">To achieve this, go to <strong class="bold" lang="">My courses</strong> on the <strong class="bold" lang="">Site</strong> menu. Why does the course appear in the list of my courses? Remember that <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>when we created the course earlier on, Moodle automatically added our account to the course. Click on a course, select the <strong class="bold" lang="">Participants</strong> tab again, and click on the <strong class="bold" lang="">Enrol users</strong> button to add more users. A pop-up window will appear, where you select one or many users via the <span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="bold" lang="">Search</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang=""> field:</span></p>

<p lang="en-GB">You have probably spotted the <strong class="bold" lang="">Assign role</strong> dropdown below the list of selected user accounts. This is where<a id="_idIndexMarker182"/> you select what role the selected user(s) will be granted, which leads us to the third vertex of our <span class="No-Break" lang="">triangle: </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">roles</em></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-70" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Exploring Moodle roles</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">Roles define what users<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> can or cannot see and do in your Moodle system. Moodle comes with several predefined roles – we already saw <strong class="bold" lang="">Student</strong> and <strong class="bold" lang="">Teacher</strong> – but it also allows us to create our own roles – for instance, guardians or <span class="No-Break" lang="">external assessors.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-71" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Putting roles into context</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Each role<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> has a specific scope (called its <strong class="bold" lang="">context</strong>), defined <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>by a set of permissions (expressed<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> as <strong class="bold" lang="">capabilities</strong>). For example, a teacher is allowed to grade an assignment, whereas a student isn’t. Alternatively, a student is allowed to submit an assignment, whereas a <span class="No-Break" lang="">teacher isn’t.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading" lang="en-GB">Important note</p>
<p class="callout" lang="en-GB">A role is assigned to a user in <span class="No-Break" lang="">a context.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Okay, so what is a context? A context is a ring-fenced area in Moodle where roles can be assigned to users. A user can be assigned different roles in different contexts. The context can be a course, a category, an activity module, another user, a block, the home page, or Moodle itself. For instance, you are assigned the <strong class="bold" lang="">Administrator</strong> role for the entire system, but additionally, you might be assigned the <strong class="bold" lang="">Teacher</strong> role in any courses you are responsible for; or <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>a learner will be given the <strong class="bold" lang="">Student</strong> role in a course, but might have been granted the <strong class="bold" lang="">Teacher</strong> role in a forum to act as a (<span class="No-Break" lang="">temporary) moderator.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-72" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Defining roles</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">To give you a feel of how a <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>role is defined, let’s go to <strong class="bold" lang="">Site administration</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Users</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Permissions</strong> | <strong class="bold" lang="">Define roles</strong>. Click on the <strong class="bold" lang="">Teacher</strong> role, and after some general settings, you will see a (very) long list <span class="No-Break" lang="">of capabilities:</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.9 – Roles, permissions, and capabilities</p>
<p lang="en-GB">We will deal with all this in greater detail in <a href="B18779_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><span class="No-Break" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic" lang="">Managing Permissions, Roles, and Capabilities</em>, so there’s no need <span class="No-Break" lang="">to panic!</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">For now, we only want to stick with the example we used throughout the chapter. Now that we know what roles are, we can slightly rephrase what we have done. Instead of saying, “We have enroled the user <strong class="source-inline" lang="">aileen.bittner</strong> in the course <strong class="source-inline" lang="">ALGDS1</strong> as a student,” we would say, “We have assigned the student role to the user <strong class="source-inline" lang="">aileen.bittner</strong> in the context of the <span class="No-Break" lang="">course </span><span class="No-Break" lang=""><strong class="source-inline" lang="">ALGDS1</strong></span><span class="No-Break" lang="">.”</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Roles are critical when granting and denying permissions to users. However, try sticking with the preconfigured roles <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>in Moodle when you get started, since they have proven to be sufficient in most setups. You can always adjust roles at a later stage, if or <span class="No-Break" lang="">when required.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">This concludes the section on permissions, completing the triangle of courses, users, and roles. Being equipped with this knowledge, you are now ready to take on the three core concepts in <span class="No-Break" lang="">more detail.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-73" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Summary</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">This chapter briefly introduced the concepts of Moodle courses, users, and roles. We also saw how central they are to Moodle and how they are inherently intertwined. Any one of these concepts simply cannot exist without the other two, which is something you should <span class="No-Break" lang="">remember throughout.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Just to recap, the three key takeaways from this chapter are <span class="No-Break" lang="">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li lang="en-GB">Courses comprise activities and resources, and this is where your students’ learning takes place. Courses are organized hierarchically <span class="No-Break" lang="">into categories.</span></li>
<li lang="en-GB">Users are represented by an account; access is granted to the system by authentication and courses <span class="No-Break" lang="">by enrolment.</span></li>
