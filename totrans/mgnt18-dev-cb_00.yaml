- en: Magento is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms on the market because
    it is free, stable, and offers a lot of functionalities. A lot of e-commerce websites
    are built with Magento. Developing in Magento is not as easy as you would expect.
    When you want to start with Magento, a good guide that shows you the best practices
    will be very helpful while learning Magento development, and that is what this
    book has set out to do.

- en: We will start this book with the creation of a good development environment
    using the right tools. We will create a web server where we will put a Magento
    installation with sample products in it. We will create a custom theme to change
    the look and feel of the webshop. The focus of this book will be the development
    part. We will create a custom module that follows the best practices of Magento.
    We will customize this module with a lot of common features that are used in Magento
    projects, such as extra controller pages, database integrations, custom shipping
    methods, and extra backend interfaces. At the end of the book, we will see how
    we can improve the performance of our Magento installation. Finally, we will see
    some debugging techniques such as xDebug and create a unit test with PHPUnit.
