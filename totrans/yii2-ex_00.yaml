- en: Yii is a high-performance PHP framework that is best for developing Web 2.0
    applications that provide fast, secure, and professional features to rapidly create
    robust projects. However, this rapid development requires the ability to organize
    common tasks together to build a complete application. It's all too easy to get
    confused about the use of these technologies.
