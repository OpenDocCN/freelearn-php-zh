- en: Drupal is a web-based **Content Management System** (**CMS**). While it is useful
    out of the box, it is designed with developers in mind. The purpose of this book
    is to explain how Drupal can be extended in many ways and for many purposes. To
    this end, the version we will use will be the latest one at the time of writing
    this book—Drupal 8.7.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we will cover a wide range of development topics. We'll discuss
    how to create a Drupal 8 module, and as we go through the chapters, many concepts
    and tips that will help you build what you need. The goal is not only to explain
    how things work but also to go through some examples in order to demonstrate them.
    Since no book can contain everything, I hope that after reading this book, you'll
    be able to expand on this knowledge on your own using the resources I reference
    and by looking into the Drupal core code itself. As helpful as such a book can
    be for learning any kind of software development, if you really want to progress,
    you will need to apply the knowledge you learned and explore the source code yourself.
    Only by doing this will you be able to understand complex systems with many dependencies
    and layers.

    of all users. To that end, Drupal's capabilities can be easily extended with modules,
    themes, and installation profiles. Take a look at Drupal's main website, ([http://drupal.org](http://drupal.org)),
    and you will find thousands of modules that provide new features and thousands
    of themes that transform the look and feel of the application or website.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flexible way Drupal can be extended and transformed through the module and
    theme mechanisms has led many to claim that Drupal isn't just a CMS, but a **Content
    Management Framework** (**CMF**) capable of being re-tooled to specific needs
    and functional requirements. This is particularly the case with Drupal 8—the latest
    version of Drupal and the focus of this book—as great progress has been made on
    the extensibility front as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Establishing whether Drupal is rightly called a CMS or CMF is beyond our purpose
    here, but it is certain that Drupal's most tremendous asset is its extensibility.
    Want to use a directory server for authentication? There's a Drupal module for
    that. Want to export data to **Comma-separated Version** (**CSV**) files? There
    are several modules for that (depending on what data you want to export). Interested
    in Facebook support, integration with Twitter, or adding a Share This button?
    Yup, there are modules for those too—all of which are available on Drupal.org
    and provided by developers like you.

- en: Installing Drupal 8 in the traditional way is documented both on [Drupal.org](http://Drupal.org)
    and in the `INSTALL.txt` file found inside the `/core` folder of the installation,
    so I won't go into it here. I will, however, mention that a better way of installing
    Drupal 8, especially for developers, is by using the accepted Composer template
    for Drupal 8 projects found on GitHub ([https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project)).
    However, the instructions for setting up your site are well covered there as well.
  prefs: []

    Drupal 8.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Drupal is written in the PHP programming language. PHP is a widely supported,
    multiplatform, and web-centric scripting language. Since Drupal is written in
    PHP, this book will largely feature code written in PHP, albeit with Drupal standard
    practices being kept in mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very important to note that the minimum version of PHP required for Drupal
    8 to run (and install via Composer) is 7.1\. Therefore PHP 5 is no longer supported,
    neither by Drupal nor by the PHP community at large. By the time you read this
    book, you should probably be running Drupal on PHP 7.3 or at least 7.2
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regarding the style of PHP, a very important change compared to Drupal 7 is
    the heavy use of object-oriented code and design patterns. Granted, many procedural
    style approaches remain throughout the Drupal 8 code base, but the use of a good
    number of popular external libraries (such as Symfony components) has pushed the
    overall Drupal code to be more modern. For this reason, it is also quite important
    that you have at least some basic understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming**
    (**OOP**), especially PHP-related, if you want to do Drupal 8 development.
  prefs: []

- en: Databases and MySQL
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past, Drupal has supported two databases—MySQL and PostgreSQL. Drupal
    7 and 8 have moved beyond this. Drupal now uses the powerful **PHP Data Objects**
    (**PDO**) library that is standard in PHP 7\. This library is an abstraction layer
    that allows developers to support numerous databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL,
    SQLite, and MariaDB.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    conventions that make it easy to interact with your database—which, combined,
    allow you to write safe and portable SQL. However, more and more abstractions
    have been made at different levels, removing the need for SQL writing almost completely.
    However, we will still see some examples just so your toolbox does not miss anything,
    as well as cover all the tools at your disposal for querying your database.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We do not explicitly cover the web server layer anywhere in this book, primarily
    because development rarely requires working at that low level. However, Drupal
    expects a fair amount of processing from the web server layer, including the handling
    of URL rewriting. For more information on what you can expect, you can consult
    the relevant documentation page at [https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/web-server](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/web-server).

    we provide an overview of Drupal's architecture, with a focus on Drupal 8.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'From an architectural standpoint, we can break up Drupal into three pieces:
    its core, modules and themes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we discuss Drupal 8 core, we can interpret it in two ways. A more restrictive
    interpretation sees it as the functionality covered by all the code it ships with,
    excluding modules and themes. The more widespread interpretation sees it as the
    total code base it ships with (*out of the box*).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the most widespread interpretation is the latter (not least because
    it differentiates all the functionalities its standard installation contains versus
    all others provided by contributed modules and themes), it is interesting to consider
    the first one as well, even if just for a minute. Because in doing so we can distinguish,
    architecturally speaking, the base code from the modules and themes that provide
    various functionalities and layouts. And why is this distinction interesting?
    Because at the bridge between the two comes into play the hooks and events that
    will also allow us to inject ties to our own functionality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The core libraries are made up of code belonging to the Drupal project and those
    from the wider PHP community, which Drupal borrows under open source licensing.
    This latter approach is new in Drupal 8 and has been regarded by many as a positive
    shift toward getting off the Drupal island and embracing outside libraries, frameworks,
    and communities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Essentially, the core libraries provide the functions and services used throughout
    Drupal. For example, helpers for interacting with the database, translating between
    languages, sanitizing user data, building forms, encoding data, and many such
    utilities are found in Drupal's core libraries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The modules (both core and contributed) are where most of the actual business
    logic is encapsulated. If enabled, they can provide functionality or extend the
    existing one. Most of the core modules are needed and cannot be disabled due to
    their importance in the standard Drupal installation. However, contributed ones
    can be installed and uninstalled as needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The themes (both core and contributed) are an important part of the theme system
    and are used by the presentation layer. They provide HTML templates within which
    content and data can be rendered to the user, as well as CSS styling and even
    client-side scripting for some nice visual interactions. Themes can extend other
    themes and can also contain some PHP logic to process the data before being rendered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hooks, plugins, and events
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we have seen what the core libraries, modules, and themes do, let's
    talk briefly about hooks and events to understand how they are all connected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hooks are a very typical Drupal procedural concept that allows Drupal core and
    modules to gather data from other modules and themes (or expose it). By doing
    this, the latter can provide new functionality or alter existing ones. It is the
    responsibility of the code that *invokes* the hook to make use of whatever the
    hook *implementations* return. The format for whatever the latter need to return
    is usually described in the hook documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Concretely, hooks work by scanning installed modules and themes and looking
    for a function that follows a specific naming pattern (in other words, a *hook
    implementation*). This is, in most cases, in the following format—`module_name_hook_name`.
    Additionally, there are also *alter* hooks, which have the word alter tacked on
    the end of the function name and are used to change data passed as a reference
    to the hook implementation. We will see examples of hooks later in the book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers with a background in OOP or with a strong knowledge of design patterns
    might recognize this as being similar to the event handling paradigm captured
    in the Passive Observer pattern. When some particular event occurs, Drupal allows
    modules the opportunity to respond to that event.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In previous versions of Drupal, hooks were KING. Yes, I wrote this in capital
    letters; my *Caps Lock* did not get stuck. This is because they were the way to
    add or extend functionality in modules. As such, they were the single most important
    aspect of Drupal programming. In Drupal 8, however, although still important,
    they took a backseat to new concepts, such as plugins and events.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Drupal 8, I dare to say that plugins are king. Much of the logic that used
    to be tied to Drupal via hooks is now added in through **plugins** (not to be
    confused with WordPress plugins). Drupal 8 plugins are discoverable bits of the
    functionality centralized by a manager and that are used for certain tasks and
    features. We will see more about plugins and provide many examples later in the
    book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A third extension point introduced in Drupal 8 is the event system. Unlike the
    first two, however, this is not specific to Drupal, but is, in fact, the actual
    Symfony `EventDispatcher` component ([http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher.html](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher.html)).
    Events are primarily used in Drupal to intercept certain actions or flows in order
    to either stop or modify them. Many *request to response* tasks that were handled
    via hooks in the past are now being handled by dispatching events to check whether
    any modules are interested in, for example, delivering the response to the user.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another architecturally important element of Drupal 8 is the Symfony dependency
    injection component ([http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html)),
    specifically represented by the service container.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This component is a staple of modern OOP PHP programming and as such has become
    foundational to Drupal 8\. It allows us to create *services* that can be injected
    in various places of our code in order to handle certain functional (and oftentimes
    swappable) tasks. Additionally, they can also be used as an extension point because
    the service container is able to group services that have very specific responsibilities
    and use them for that automatically. In other words, simply by defining a simple
    service, we can provide our own functionality or even change existing logic.

    events, such as `kernel.request`, `kernel.controller`, `kernel.response`, and
    `kernel.view`.

- en: The route controller is identified, and the `kernel.controller` event is used
    to perform any alterations on the responsible controller, as well as to resolve
    the arguments that need to be passed to it. In our case, this route is registered
    by the Node module through the main Entity system, which identifies the entity
    ID, loads it, and builds the markup to be returned as part of the response.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the respective controller (or handler) returns something other than a response
    object, the `kernel.view` event is dispatched to check whether there is any code
    that can transform that into a Response object. In most cases, in Drupal 8, we
    typically return render arrays, which are transformed into Response objects.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    terminates the request.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this context, as Drupal 8 module developers, we spend most of our time inside
    controllers and services, trying to figure out what we need to return to the page.
    We then rely on Drupal to transform our render array into a proper response to
    the user, but we can also return one ourselves directly. Moreover, the theme system
    comes into play here, as well as the block system, because our content gets wrapped
    into a block that is placed in a region surrounded by other regions that contain
    other blocks. If it sounds complicated now, don't worry; we will cover in detail

    hook each Drupal developer had to know very well. All of that has been abandoned
    in Drupal 8 in favor of the Symfony Routing component ([http:/](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[/](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[symfony.](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[com/](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[doc/](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[current/](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[components/](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[routing.](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)[html](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing.html)).

    content in Drupal. The most famous type of entity has always been the Node, and
    it has been historically the cornerstone of content storage and display. In Drupal
    8, the entire entity system has been revamped to make other entity types potentially
    just as important. They have been brought to the forefront and have been properly
    connected with other systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All entity types can have multiple `bundles`, which are different *variations*
    of the same entity type and can have different fields on them (while sharing some
    base fields).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Drupal core still ships with the Node entity type, with a few bundles such as
    Basic Page and Article in its standard installation profile. In addition, it comes
    with a few other entity types, such as `User`, `Comment`, and `File`. However,
    creating your own entity type in Drupal 8 has become much more standardized compared
    to Drupal 7 where contributed modules had to be brought into play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are not the only types of entities we have in Drupal 8\. The aforementioned examples are
    all content entity types. Drupal 8, however, also introduced the configuration
    entity types. The former are for modeling content, but in reality, they are for
    anything that holds data that can be stored in the database and is specific to
    that environment. They are not used for storing configuration, though. Users and
    content are great examples, as they do not need to be (usually) deployable from
    one environment to another. The latter, on the other hand, are exportable items
    of configuration, of which there can be more than one. For example, a content
    entity *bundle* is a great example because there can be more than one bundle for
    a certain entity type; they have some metadata and information stored that can
    differ from bundle to bundle, and they need to be deployed on all environments.
    That is, they are fundamental to the correct functioning of the site.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    8 because it provides a powerful way to model custom data and content. Nodes are

    if you've been coding PHP applications you know how forms have always been a pain
    from the point of view of securely and efficiently rendering and processing the
    submitted data. As soon as you use a PHP framework such as Symfony or Laravel,
    you will note that an API is in place to take much of that load off your shoulders.
  prefs: []

    been a great abstraction over having to output your own form elements and deal
    with posted values. It allows you to define your own form definition in OOP and
    handle validation and submission in a logical way. Its rendering and processing
    is taken care of by Drupal securely, so you don't have to worry about any of that.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the major pet-peeves of Drupal developers (and developers of other popular
    CMSes for that matter) has always been the way configuration is handled and deployed
    from one environment to the next. Drupal 7 stored most of its configuration in
    the database, so various solutions had to be concocted by developers to get that
    moved up the ladder as development progressed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Drupal 8, great advancements have been made in this respect with the introduction
    of a centralized configuration system. Although it stores all configuration in
    the database, it allows it all to be exported into YML files (and then reimported).
    So, from a development point of view, we have a much better experience if certain
    features depend on configuration (for example, a new field).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Configuration is also of two kinds—simple and complex (configuration entities
    we noted in the *Entities* section). The difference between the two is that the
    former is always singular. In other words, there is only one instance of itself.
    For example, the site name and email address are stored inside such a configuration
    item. You wouldn't expect the need for more than one instance of it. However,
    in the case of the latter, you would. For example, a View definition is such a
    configuration entity because it follows a certain schema and we can have multiple
    View definitions. Makes sense doesn't it?

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Plugins are new to Drupal 8 and are an elegant solution to an important problem—
    encapsulating functionality. Right off the bat, you should not confuse them with
    things such as the WordPress plugins, which are more akin to Drupal modules. Instead,
    you should think of plugins as components of reusable code that can be used and
    managed by a central system. Typically, they are used when a system handles a
    task in a certain way (plugin A) but allows other modules to provide different
    ways to handle that task (plugin B or C).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You can also look at plugins as being opposite to entities: not used for data
    storage, but for functionality. Instead of creating a type of data that gets stored,
    you create a type of functionality that is used. The two usually work hand in
    hand, especially when it comes to manipulating the data in different ways.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important aspect of how they work is their discoverability. Most plugin types
    (but definitely not all) are discovered via something called *Annotations*. Annotations
    are a form of DocBlock comments, borrowed from the Doctrine library ([http:/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[docs.](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[doctrine-](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[project.](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[org/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[projects/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[doctrine-](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[common/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[en/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[latest/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[reference/](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[annotations.](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)[html](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html)),
    by which we can describe classes, methods, and even properties with certain metadata.
    This metadata is then read to determine what that item is without the need for
    instantiating the class. In Drupal 8, we use annotations only at a class level
    to denote that it is a plugin implementation with certain characteristics. That
    is how most plugins are discovered in Drupal 8.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second most common discoverability method for plugins is via a YAML file,
    and a popular example of those are menu links (as we will see later in the book).
    However, for now, you should know that plugins are very widely used, and we will
    create quite a few plugins in this book.

    is important to know that both modules and themes can theme data or content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we will focus on the aspects that happen at the module level.
    We will not concern ourselves with styling, but work primarily with theming definitions
    and templates that are needed within the module. Typically, it is best practice
    to ensure that modules are able to theme their data. If done right, themes can
    then come into play to style the output or override that theming to change the
    presentation altogether.

    8 has gone to great lengths to improve the performance of building pages and rendering
    data. To this end, the caching system has become an important part to consider
    whenever we either do complex or heavy calculations or render content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a module developer's perspective, there are two main pillars of the caching
    system. The first one provides developers with a cache backend to store the results
    of complex data calculations. This can be read in the next requests to avoid the
    need for reprocessing that task. This goes hand in hand with the cache invalidation
    that happens when something in the system changes that would require the calculations
    to be redone. The second pillar is the render cache, which allows developers to
    wrap their output with metadata that describes when the cache of that output needs
    to be invalidated.
