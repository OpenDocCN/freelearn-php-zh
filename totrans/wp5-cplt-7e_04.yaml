    A blog post also has a lot of other information attached to it, such as a date,
    excerpt, tags, and categories. In this section, you will learn how to create a

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why is it called the *block-based* editor? Because of the way the editor
    handles content and manages their structure. The content that you have within
    your posts or pages is divided into individual blocks, one below the other, all
    arranged neatly on a (digital) canvas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before block-based editing, WordPress used a traditional what-you-see-is-what-you-get
    editor. It used a classic paragraph-based structure—an approach very similar to
    how you'd build a Google or a Word document. However, such a traditional structure
    isn't always suited to handle the modern content requirements of the web. In other
    words, it makes it hard to build elaborate, visually pleasing blog posts or pages
    and present them effectively on different devices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Block-based editing makes more sense since each block of content can be treated
    individually and handled differently depending on the device used to view the
    content. Moreover, it's easier to rearrange blocks than it is paragraphs.

    with a way to communicate with other websites—to let them know that you've published
    a post mentioning them, or vice versa, in one way or the other (usually through
    a link). Nowadays, however, trackbacks and pingbacks are becoming somewhat out
    of date and most bloggers don't even bother to check the trackbacks/pingbacks
    that they're receiving. For what it's worth, you can probably safely ignore trackbacks
    and pingbacks entirely. The decision of to whether or not to support them on your
    site is entirely up to you.

    Codex itself. The resource provided at [https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post_Slug](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post_Slug)
    teaches us that the post slug is made from a few lowercase words separated by
    dashes, describing a post and usually derived from the post title to create a
    user-friendly permalink.
  prefs: []

    URL. For example, my post about my top three favorite dishes uses this URL: `http://localhost/my-top-3-favorite-dishes/`,
    where the last part —`my-top-3-favorite-dishes`, is the slug. Just like the official
    definition says, WordPress chooses the slug by taking my post title, making it
    all lowercase, removing all punctuation, and replacing spaces with dashes. If
    I''d prefer it to be something else, such as `3-favorite-dishes`, I can change
    it by going to the Document tab of the settings sidebar and looking for the section
    labeled Permalink:'
