    to use the British English spelling for the term for two main reasons: first,
    in Moodle internally, *enrolment* is used throughout – for example, as a parameter
    in batch files – and second, Moodle Docs use *enrol* (Moodle is Australian after
    all). So, *enrol* and *enrolment* it is! Switch to the **en_us** language pack

    Docs使用*enrol*（毕竟Moodle是澳大利亚的）。所以，*enrol*和*enrolment*就这样定了！如果你因此发疯。或者疯狂。或者两者兼而有之。

- en: Before we start, it is vital to understand the difference between authentication
    and enrolment. Users must be authenticated to log in to Moodle, and **authentication**
    grants your users access to the system through a login where a username and password
    must be given. Moodle supports a significant number of authentication mechanisms,
    such as MS-AD, LDAP, and SAML. For now, let’s work with so-called manual authentication
    to simplify overall user management.
  id: totrans-54
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在我们开始之前，理解认证和注册之间的区别至关重要。用户必须通过认证才能登录到Moodle，而**认证**通过登录授予用户访问系统，需要提供用户名和密码。Moodle支持大量的认证机制，例如MS-AD、LDAP和SAML。目前，让我们使用所谓的手动认证来简化整体用户管理。
- en: '**Enrolment** happens at a course level. However, a user must be authenticated
    on the system before enrolment on a course can take place. The house and key analogy
    might help: you need a key (authentication) to the house (Moodle), and you then
    need a separate key (enrolment) for each room (course).'
  id: totrans-55
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**注册**发生在课程层面。然而，在课程注册之前，用户必须在系统中进行认证。房屋和钥匙的类比可能会有所帮助：你需要一个进入房屋（Moodle）的钥匙（认证），然后你需要为每个房间（课程）单独的钥匙（注册）。'

  zh: 再次，这个顺序很好地展示了在Moodle中课程、用户和角色是如何相互交织的。另一种看待认证和注册之间区别的方法是用户如何获得课程的访问权限。请记住，这是一个非常简化的观点，它忽略了支持的功能，如外部认证、访客访问和自助注册：

  zh: 图3.5 – 认证和注册
- en: During the authentication phase, a user enters their credentials (username and
    password), or they are entered automatically via single sign-on. The user is granted
    access if the account exists locally – that is, within Moodle – and the password
    is valid. The check will be carried out remotely if the account is held externally
    – for instance, in an active directory.
  id: totrans-63
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在认证阶段，用户输入他们的凭据（用户名和密码），或者通过单点登录自动输入。如果账户存在于本地（即在Moodle内部）且密码有效，则用户将被授予访问权限。如果账户在外部持有（例如，在活动目录中），则检查将在远程进行。
- en: Once this is successful, the next phase is enrolment. If the user is enroled
    and the enrolment hasn’t expired, access is granted to the course where resources
    and activities can be worked through. As mentioned before, this graphic only shows
    the very basics, but for now, it hopefully demonstrates the difference between
    authentication and enrolment. You will come across a more detailed version of
    these graphics in [*Chapter 4*](B18779_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074), *Managing Courses

    contexts. The context can be a course, a category, an activity module, another
    user, a block, the home page, or Moodle itself. For instance, you are assigned
    the **Administrator** role for the entire system, but additionally, you might
    be assigned the **Teacher** role in any courses you are responsible for; or a
    learner will be given the **Student** role in a course, but might have been granted
    the **Teacher** role in a forum to act as a (temporary) moderator.

  zh: 好的，那么什么是上下文呢？上下文是在Moodle中分配角色给用户的一个隔离区域。用户可以在不同的上下文中被分配不同的角色。上下文可以是课程、类别、活动模块、另一个用户、一个块、主页或Moodle本身。例如，你被分配了整个系统的**管理员**角色，但除此之外，你可能在负责的任何课程中都被分配了**教师**角色；或者一个学习者在一个课程中被分配了**学生**角色，但在论坛中可能被授予了**教师**角色以充当（临时的）版主。

- en: For now, we only want to stick with the example we used throughout the chapter.
    Now that we know what roles are, we can slightly rephrase what we have done. Instead
    of saying, “We have enroled the user `aileen.bittner` in the course `ALGDS1` as
    a student,” we would say, “We have assigned the student role to the user `aileen.bittner`
    in the context of the course `ALGDS1`.”

  zh: 目前，我们只想坚持使用本章中使用的示例。既然我们已经知道了角色的概念，我们可以稍微修改一下我们之前所说的内容。与其说“我们已经将用户`aileen.bittner`注册为`ALGDS1`课程的学员”，我们可以说“我们在`ALGDS1`课程中为用户`aileen.bittner`分配了学员角色。”
- en: Roles are critical when granting and denying permissions to users. However,
    try sticking with the preconfigured roles in Moodle when you get started, since
    they have proven to be sufficient in most setups. You can always adjust roles
    at a later stage, if or when required.

  zh: 在授予和拒绝用户权限时，角色至关重要。然而，当你开始使用Moodle时，尽量坚持使用预配置的角色，因为它们在大多数设置中已被证明是足够的。如果需要，你可以在稍后阶段调整角色。

- en: This chapter briefly introduced the concepts of Moodle courses, users, and roles.
    We also saw how central they are to Moodle and how they are inherently intertwined.
    Any one of these concepts simply cannot exist without the other two, which is
    something you should remember throughout.
