    to, or watch learning resources, participate in activities, submit work, collaborate

    fashion. Users have to go through an **Authentication** process to get access
    to Moodle. They then have to go through the **Enrolments** step to participate
    in **Courses**, which themselves are organized into **Categories**. **Groups &
    Cohorts** are different ways to group users at course level or site-wide, respectively.
    **Users** are granted **Roles**, in particular, **Contexts**, which are ring-fenced
    Moodle areas; the scope of the role is specified by configuring **Permissions**.

    users, we have no courses to enrol them on; if we start with courses, we have
    no users who can participate in them. Not to worry, though – Moodle lets us go
    back and forth between administrative areas and often perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

    in Moodle internally, *enrolment* is used throughout – for example, as a parameter
    in batch files – and second, Moodle Docs use *enrol* (Moodle is Australian after

    and enrolment. Users must be authenticated to log in to Moodle, and **authentication**
    grants your users access to the system through a login where a username and password
    must be given. Moodle supports a significant number of authentication mechanisms,
    such as MS-AD, LDAP, and SAML. For now, let’s work with so-called manual authentication
    to simplify overall user management.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Enrolment** happens at a course level. However, a user must be authenticated
    on the system before enrolment on a course can take place. The house and key analogy
    might help: you need a key (authentication) to the house (Moodle), and you then
    need a separate key (enrolment) for each room (course).'

    authentication, guest access, and self-enrolment:'

    password), or they are entered automatically via single sign-on. The user is granted
    access if the account exists locally – that is, within Moodle – and the password
    is valid. The check will be carried out remotely if the account is held externally
    – for instance, in an active directory.

    the very basics, but for now, it hopefully demonstrates the difference between
    authentication and enrolment. You will come across a more detailed version of

    user, a block, the home page, or Moodle itself. For instance, you are assigned
    the **Administrator** role for the entire system, but additionally, you might
    be assigned the **Teacher** role in any courses you are responsible for; or a
