  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CodeIgniter is an easy-to-pick-up framework written in PHP; so, familiarity
    with PHP and CodeIgniter is advantageous. But, having no experience with CodeIgniter
    shouldn't be a road block to read the book either. The best thing to do (if you're
    unsure) is to buy it and just jump in. Having said that, if you are familiar with
    CodeIgniter, this book can provide immediate sold snippets and recipes you can
    use for all sorts of day-to-day, CodeIgniter-related tasks.
