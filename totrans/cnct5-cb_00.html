<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Readers will need a copy of concrete5 running on a development (not production) server. This will allow readers to experiment with many different elements of the concrete5 API without disrupting normal website operation.</p><p>Readers will also need a code editor that is capable of editing the PHP files. This can be something like an advanced editor such as Adobe Dreamweaver or a basic text editor, such as Vim.</p><p>Some chapters also deal with browsing and querying MySQL databases, so a query browsing tool is recommended. HeidiSQL (on Windows), Sequel Pro (on OS X), and MySQL Workbench (all platforms) are some great tools that provide advanced functionality while browsing databases.</p></div>
