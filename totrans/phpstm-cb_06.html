They have always kept on saying that united you stand and divided you fall. A PhpStorm cookbook author also used to say that reinventing the wheel is an action that should be avoided. Thus, you should always work in a team. The reason is obvious: a task divided among a team is completed faster.</p><p>According to a principle of software engineering, you should program in a team of two. This way, both of you will be able to discover errors in each other's code in the development phase itself.</p><p>So, when you work in a team, how will you work on an application development in which someone else is working on another module? One way is to use that same machine to code so that you can continue from the point where the other person stops working. But, is it wise to wait? It's OK that you work in a different shift. But, what if that person is geographically remote from you? Even if everything is favorable and if you need a third person to join the team, where will that person work? If you work for 8 hours, there can be a maximum of three people working on a project at any instant. Such inefficient usage of infrastructure!</p><p>How do you feel <a id="id381" class="indexterm"/>about the code repository? What do you think when someone says <span class="strong"><strong>version control</strong></span>
<a id="id382" class="indexterm"/> or <span class="strong"><strong>source control</strong></span>
<a id="id383" class="indexterm"/> before you? What do you know about VCS... VCS as in <span class="strong"><strong>version control system</strong></span>?</p><p>What is meant by a version of software?</p><p>To get the answer, you have stepped into the world of version control systems. Welcome!</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Getting a VCS server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec74"/>Getting a VCS server</h1></div></div></div><p>The first action that you have to undertake is to decide which version of VCS you are going to use. There are a number of systems available, such as Git and Subversion (commonly known as SVN). It is free and open source software that you can download and install on your development server. There is another system named <a id="id384" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>concurrent versions system</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CVS</strong></span>). Both are meant to provide a code versioning service to you. SVN is newer and supposedly faster than CVS. Since SVN is the newer system and in order to provide information to you on the latest matters, this text will concentrate on the features of Subversion only.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec161"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>So, finally that moment<a id="id385" class="indexterm"/> has arrived when you will start off working in a team by getting a VCS system for you and your team. The installation of SVN on the development system can be done in two ways: easy and difficult. The difficult step can be skipped without consideration because that is for the developers who want to contribute to the Subversion system. Since you are dealing with PhpStorm, you need to remember the easier way because you have a lot more to do.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec162"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>The installation step is very easy. There is this <span class="strong"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> utility<a id="id386" class="indexterm"/> available with Debian-based systems, and there is the Yum utility available with Red Hat-based systems. Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You just need to issue the command <code class="literal">apt-get install subversion</code>. The operating system's package manager will do the remaining work for you. In a very short time, after flooding the command-line console with messages, you will have the Subversion system installed.</li><li class="listitem">To check whether the installation was successful, you need to issue the command <code class="literal">whereis svn</code>. If there is a message, it means that you installed Subversion successfully.<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note25"/>Note</h3><p>If you do not want to bear the load of installing Subversion on your development system, you can use commercial third-party servers. But that is more of a layman's approach to solving problems, and no PhpStorm cookbook author will recommend that you do that. You are a software engineer; you should not let go easily.</p></div></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec163"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>When you install the <a id="id387" class="indexterm"/>version control system, you actually install a server that provides the version control service to a version control client. The subversion control service listens for incoming connections from remote clients on port number <code class="literal">3690</code> by default.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec164"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>If you want to install the older companion, CVS, you can do that in a similar way, as shown in the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You need to download the archive for the CVS server software.</li><li class="listitem">You need to unpack it from the archive using your favorite unpacking software.</li><li class="listitem">You can move it to another convenient location since you will not need to disturb this folder in the future.</li><li class="listitem">You then need to move into the directory, and there will start your compilation process. You need to do <code class="literal">#. /configure</code> to create the make targets. Having made the target, you need to enter <code class="literal">#make install</code> to complete the installation procedure.</li></ol></div><p>Due to it being older software, you might have to compile from the source code as the only alternative.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating a VCS repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec75"/>Creating a VCS repository</h1></div></div></div><p>More often than not, a <a id="id388" class="indexterm"/>PHP programmer is expected to know some system concepts because it is often required to change settings for the PHP interpreter. The changes could be in the form of, say, changing the execution time or adding/removing modules, and so on. In order to start working in a team, you are going to get your hands dirty with system actions.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec165"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>You will have to create a new repository on the development server so that PhpStorm can act as a client and get connected. Here, it is important to note the difference between an SVN client and an SVN server—an SVN client can be any of these: a standalone client or an embedded client such as an IDE. The SVN server, on the other hand, is a single item. It is a continuously running process on a server of your choice.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec166"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>You need to be careful while <a id="id389" class="indexterm"/>performing this activity as a single mistake can ruin your efforts. Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">There is a command <code class="literal">svnadmin</code> that you need to know. Using this command, you can create a new directory on the server that will contain the code base in it. Again, you should be careful when selecting a directory on the server as it will appear in your SVN URL for the rest part of your life. The command should be executed as:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>svnadmin create /path/to/your/repo/</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Having created a new repository on the server, you need to make certain settings for the server. This is just a normal phenomenon because every server requires a configuration.</li><li class="listitem">The SVN server configuration is located under <code class="literal">/path/to/your/repo/conf/</code> with the name <code class="literal">svnserve.conf</code>. Inside the file, you need to make three changes. You need to add these lines at the bottom of the file:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">anon-access = none
auth-access = write
password-db = passwd</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>There has to be a password file to authorize a list of users who will be allowed to use the repository. The password file in this case will be named <code class="literal">passwd</code> (the default filename). The contents in the file will be a number of lines, each containing a username and the corresponding password in the form of <code class="literal">username = password</code>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"/>Note</h3><p>Since these files are scanned by the server according to a particular algorithm, you don't have the freedom to leave deliberate spaces in the file—there will be error messages displayed in those cases.</p></div></div><p>Having made the appropriate settings, you can now make the SVN service run so that an SVN client can access it.</p><p>You need to issue the command <code class="literal">svnserve -d</code> to do that.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip24"/>Tip</h3><p>It is always good practice to keep checking whether what you do is correct. To validate proper installation, you need to issue the command <code class="literal">svn ls svn://user@host/path/to/subversion/repo/</code>.</p></div></div><p>The output will be as <a id="id390" class="indexterm"/>shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_01.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec167"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">svnadmin</code> command<a id="id391" class="indexterm"/> is used to perform admin tasks on the Subversion server. The <code class="literal">create</code> option creates a new folder on the server that acts as the repository for access from Subversion clients.</p><p>The configuration file is created by default at the time of server installation. The contents that are added to the file are actually the configuration directives that control the behavior of the Subversion server. Thus, the settings mentioned prevent anonymous access and restrict the write operations to certain users whose access details are mentioned in a file.</p><p>The command <code class="literal">svnserve</code> is again a <a id="id392" class="indexterm"/>command that needs to be run on the server side and which starts the instance of the server. The <code class="literal">-d</code> switch mentions that the server should be run as a daemon (system process). This also means that your server will continue running until you manually stop it or the entire system goes down.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip25"/>Tip</h3><p>Again, you can skip this section if you have opted for a third-party version control service provider.</p></div></div></div></div>

Again, you will have difficulty searching for a good SVN client. Don't worry; the client has been factory-provided to you inside PhpStorm. The PhpStorm SVN client provides you with features that accelerate your development task by providing you detailed information about the changes made to the code. So, go ahead and connect PhpStorm to the Subversion repository you created.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec169"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to connect PhpStorm to the Subversion repository, you need to activate the Subversion view.</p><p>It is available at <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Tool Windows</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Svn Repositories</strong></span>. Perform the following steps to activate the Subversion view:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Having activated the Subversion view, you now need to add the repository location to PhpStorm.</li><li class="listitem">To do that, you need to use the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> symbol in the top-left corner in the view you have opened, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_02.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li></ol></div><p>Upon selecting the<a id="id395" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> option, there is a question asked by<a id="id396" class="indexterm"/> PhpStorm about the location of the repository. You need to provide the full location of the repository. Once you provide the location, you will be able to see the repository in the same Subversion view in which you have pressed the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button.</p><p>Here, you should always keep in mind the correct protocol to use. This depends on the way you installed the Subversion system on the development machine.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"/>Note</h3><p>If you used the default installation by installing from the installer utility (<code class="literal">apt-get</code> or <code class="literal">aptitude</code>), you need to specify <code class="literal">svn://</code>. If you have configured SVN to be accessible via <code class="literal">SSH</code>, you need to specify <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>. If you have explicitly configured SVN to be used with the Apache web server, you need to specify <code class="literal">http://</code>. If you configured SVN with Apache over the secure protocol, you need to specify <code class="literal">https://</code>.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Storing a PhpStorm project in a VCS repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec77"/>Storing a PhpStorm project in a VCS repository</h1></div></div></div><p>Here comes the actual <a id="id397" class="indexterm"/>start of the teamwork. Even if you and <a id="id398" class="indexterm"/>your other team members have connected to the repository, what advantage does it serve? What is the purpose solved by merely connecting to the version control repository? Correct. The actual thing is the code that you work on. It is the code that earns you your bread.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec170"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>You should now store a<a id="id399" class="indexterm"/> project in the Subversion repository so <a id="id400" class="indexterm"/>that the other team members can work and add more features to your code. It is time to add a project to version control. It is not that you need to start a new project from scratch to add to the repository. Any project, any work that you have done and you wish to have the team work on now can be added to the repository. Since the most relevant project in the current context is the cooking project, you can try adding that.</p><p>There you go.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec171"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to add a project to the repository, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You need to use the menu item provided at <span class="strong"><strong>VCS</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import into version control</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Share project (subversion)</strong></span>. PhpStorm will ask you a question, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_03.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">Select the correct hierarchy to define the share target—the correct location where your project will be saved.</li><li class="listitem">If you wish to create the tags and branches in the code base, you need to select the checkbox for the same. It is good practice to provide comments to the commits that you make.</li></ol></div><p>The reason behind this <a id="id401" class="indexterm"/>is apparent when you sit down to create a<a id="id402" class="indexterm"/> release document. It also makes the change more understandable for the other team members. PhpStorm then asks you the format you want the working copy to be in. This is related to the version of the version control software. You just need to smile and select the latest version number and proceed, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_04.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div><p>Having done that, PhpStorm will now ask you to enter your credentials.</p><p>You need to enter the same credentials that you saved in the configuration file (see the <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a VCS repository</em></span> recipe) or the credentials that your service provider gave you. You can ask PhpStorm to save the credentials for you, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_05.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec172"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>Here it is worth<a id="id403" class="indexterm"/> understanding what is going on behind the<a id="id404" class="indexterm"/> curtains. When you do any Subversion related task in PhpStorm, there is an inbuilt SVN client that executes the commands for you. Thus, when you add a project to version control, the code is given a version number. This makes the version system remember the state of the code base. In other words, when you add the code base to version control, you add a checkpoint that you can revisit at any point in future for the time the code base is under the same version control system.</p><p>Interesting phenomenon, isn't it?</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec173"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>If you have installed the version control software yourself and if you did not make the setting to store the password in encrypted text, PhpStorm will provide you a warning about it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_06.jpg" alt="There's more..."/></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Committing files to the VCS repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec78"/>Committing files to the VCS repository</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's get back to a use case. By<a id="id405" class="indexterm"/> now, the memories of the <code class="literal">Dish</code> class must be <a id="id406" class="indexterm"/>under a thick layer of dust since it has not been used for a while now. Go ahead, mate. Remove the dust, shred the laziness, and set off looking at things from a different perspective.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec174"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>A small amount of strain on your brain (and obviously reading documentation) will make you remember that you created the <code class="literal">Dish</code> class in a hurry. Now that you have matured enough to use PhpStorm as an IDE, you need to prove your might in programming as well. You need to make the <code class="literal">Dish</code> class more functional.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec175"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>You can begin by peeping into the only method inside the <code class="literal">Dish</code> class. Once you do, you will clearly see that there is a <code class="literal">FIXME</code> tag. As stated in the <code class="literal">FIXME</code> tag, you should check for a valid ingredient name before allowing it to be added to the dish. This will prevent any unwanted ingredients from getting added to your dish and thus spoiling it. You need to specify two changes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You need to make the parameter default to a value in the method signature</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You need to check if the name is valid, that is, non-empty and not containing invalid elements</li></ul></div><p>Thus the change you will make in the <code class="literal">Dish</code> class will be something like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_07.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec176"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the main<a id="id407" class="indexterm"/> utilities of using an IDE such as PhpStorm is<a id="id408" class="indexterm"/> that the objects are shown in such a way that you get more information out of them. When you make the changes, PhpStorm starts indicating to you the changes using colors. If you add a line, it is shown in green, and when you delete a line, it is indicated by a gray triangle pointing to your right-hand side. When you make changes to a line of code, it is shown in blue. Besides this, when you commit your code, the version control number attaches another piece of information with it, which is quite important in itself. The information contains the user who committed the date, the time of the commit, and the revision number. The revision number denotes information as to how many times that particular file has been changed.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec177"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>PhpStorm, being a careful system, provides you with a number of options to choose from. You can tell PhpStorm to automatically update the code/directory after you commit if you enable <span class="strong"><strong>Auto-update after commit</strong></span>.</p><p>If you want to keep the files<a id="id409" class="indexterm"/> locked during the commit process, you can enable this checkbox next to <span class="strong"><strong>Keep files locked</strong></span>.</p><p>There are certain programming-related tasks before the commit action.</p><p>You can reformat the code you are about to commit by enabling the <span class="strong"><strong>Reformat Code</strong></span> option.</p><p>You can remove unused imports/includes/requires from the code about to be committed by selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Optimize Imports</strong></span> option.</p><p>You can perform an analysis of the code you are about to commit by selecting the option <span class="strong"><strong>Perform Code Analysis</strong></span>.</p><p>PhpStorm can warn you if you happen to push a TODO in your code to version control by enabling the <span class="strong"><strong>Check TODO</strong></span> option. You can configure which TODO you want to view by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Configure</strong></span>. Thus, before committing, PhpStorm will show you the TODOs you have created in the file/project you are about to commit.</p><p>You can even upload the<a id="id410" class="indexterm"/> committed files to an FTP server that you might have configured. Thus, PhpStorm can also deploy the code for you!</p><p>PhpStorm keeps informing you about all the files you have changed. The names of the files that have been changed locally since the last commit are shown in blue. The files that have not been changed are shown in black by default. If you are making changes to a file and another team member happens to make changes in the same file, there will be a text conflict, and such files are shown in red. However, such conflicts occur mostly during the update process.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"/>Note</h3><p>You can change the color scheme to one of your choice. For that, you need to go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Colors &amp; Fonts</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Diff</strong></span>.</p></div></div><p>Now that your changes are done, you need to commit the code so that it is made available to other team members. You need to access the right-click context menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Subversion</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Commit</strong></span>. There is a dialog box that opens up and provides you with a view of what you are going to do. Once you are convinced that the changes are OK, you can proceed to commit the file. The file will again become black, indicating that it is in sync with the version control system.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip26"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Avoid problems</strong></span>
</p><p>It is not that you can commit and commit without problems. If another team member has committed in the same section of code in which you have made changes, the version control system prevents inconsistency in the code by providing you with a warning and disallowing you from committing the code. It throws a message that the file you are working is out of date. To avoid this problem from occurring, you always need to work on the most recent code base. Thus, always update before you commit.</p></div></div></div></div>

Enabling this option might improve the performance of the update operation because there are fewer files to be updated, following the simple rule to do less in less time.

Subversion (and other version control systems) maintains a working copy of the project. This working copy is created using a number of criteria, such as the date of modification, text that was changed, and version number. When you update the file/directory, all this and other necessary information is added to the working copy on your machine.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec181"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>If you wish to update your local copy with the copy under version control from the repository, there can be two possibilities, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You are attempting to update a file/directory in which you have not made any changes.

Due to a phobia of something unknown happening, programmers often end up in an unsynchronized version of the project on their development systems. They tend to follow Sir Isaac Newton's very first law of motion. The state of uniform motion is already described. The external force is the change in the business requirement and thus a new task assignment.</p><p>A short and simple solution to this problem is to always synchronize your code base with version control.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec183"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>Code synchronization needs more care than any other action. The reason is obvious—you might end up accepting the incorrect version of the code and thus ending up asking for more time for development. You can synchronize the code in a number of ways, and the following steps help you with one of the ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You need to know <a id="id421" class="indexterm"/>the version control history <a id="id422" class="indexterm"/>as to which change was made.</li><li class="listitem">You can do that when you select the project, access the right-click context menu, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Subversion</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Show History</strong></span> option.</li><li class="listitem">Select a version number that you want to synchronize your code base with.

This is similar to a hotel checkout, where you leave the hotel, taking all the luggage with you. Here, the analogy to a hotel is the Subversion server, and the luggage is the actual code. However, it is not a 100 percent analogy as you don't tend to check out someone else's luggage when you check out of a hotel room. Those are stunts performed by experienced professionals (pun intended).

Once selected, PhpStorm provides you with an information box that you can use to view information the way you like. You can select the version you want to compare with. It is important to note here that the order of comparison matters because you also have the option to do a reverse comparison. You can do that by enabling the <span class="strong"><strong>Reverse diff</strong></span> option.</p><p>PhpStorm provides you with two options to choose from while obtaining the difference between files. You can provide a visual treat to your eyes if you select the <span class="strong"><strong>Graphical Compare</strong></span> option, or else you can save the difference to a text file with the default name <code class="literal">diff.txt</code> in the current directory that contains your project.</p><p>You can search across the currently selected repository as well.</p><p>If you wish to search for the changes made by a particular author, you need to enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Author</strong></span> option and provide the name of a valid author.</p><p>If you wish to search for changes made after a certain date, you can enable the <span class="strong"><strong>After</strong></span> option and set the required date from a date-picker window available on clicking the button next to this option.</p><p>The same is the<a id="id427" class="indexterm"/> case when you want to search for changes made until a certain date.

<div class="section" title="Checking projects out of a VCS repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec82"/>Checking projects out of a VCS repository</h1></div></div></div><p>The phenomenon of checking out is quite interesting. You (usually) check out your luggage from a hotel room; you (most of the times) tell your friend: "Dude, check out my new Phablet"; you (are hesitant to) check out code from version control. What exactly does checking out mean? This seems more like a buzz word... checkout, checkout, and checkout!</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec188"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Context is what you need to<a id="id428" class="indexterm"/> understand. The meaning of a <a id="id429" class="indexterm"/>word changes with a change in context. In the current context, you need to do what you are hesitant to do. Thus, checking out code is a phenomenon provided for version control systems, in which you take out the latest versions of the code base and download it onto your development computer. This download is not merely a simple download, it provides you with the latest version of code available under version control and makes you aware of the list of changes that have been made to the code base up until the current date. Thus, when you check out a piece of code, you become aware of the history of the code as well.</p><p>This time, before you get the answer in the <span class="emphasis"><em>How to do it...</em></span> section, you need to know why you should do it. The team is what you were talking about when you started thinking version control. So, if a team has a new member, the only way to let the new member start working on the existing project is checkout. If your development machine has changed and you wish to resume working from where you left off, you can even use checkout for this.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec189"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>To check out code from version control is everyone's cup of tea. Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You can do it extremely easily by visiting the menu item <span class="strong"><strong>VCS</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Checkout</strong></span> from <span class="strong"><strong>Version Control</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Subversion</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Once you select that, you will be provided with a new window with the list of Subversion repositories you connected in PhpStorm irrespective of the project, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_15.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li></ol></div><p>Having selected the <a id="id430" class="indexterm"/>appropriate version, on proceeding, PhpStorm<a id="id431" class="indexterm"/> asks you where it should keep the checked out code base. You need to specify that, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_16.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div><p>When you set the target location, PhpStorm remains inquisitive. It will ask you general checkout options, such as the depth to which you want to check out the code, whether you want to check out the latest code or only until a revision, and whether you want to select the externals definition, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_17.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec190"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>Having set all the <a id="id432" class="indexterm"/>options, you can now easily sit back and enjoy<a id="id433" class="indexterm"/> the view.

<div class="section" title="Creating code patches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec83"/>Creating code patches</h1></div></div></div><p>It is often stated in three <a id="id434" class="indexterm"/>simple statements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do it</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do it right</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do it right now</li></ul></div><p>The statement is simple, but the intent is not. Every manager wants the task to be done, and it is you, the programmer's, headache to do it somehow. You often end up writing erroneous code. The misery does not end here; you happen to push it to Subversion at the end of the day to tell your manager what you worked on during the day. In this rush, you happened to push some bugs to version control. Thus, any fellow member working in another time zone will end up screwing his working copy by taking updates from version control. Now, there will be two types of resource wastage:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">That member (and any other member who's done the same) will spend time in locating the bug—a waste of person hours</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Having located the bug, you will have to undo the changes and make a few other changes—a waste of the previous person's day (when you pushed the buggy code)</li></ul></div><p>Not only this, it will be an abuse of the version control system as when the bug entered version control, the very purpose of using version control was defeated—multiple people will be doing the same task—again, reinventing the wheel.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec191"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>So, being the cause of this <a id="id435" class="indexterm"/>wastage, you must think of a solution to this problem. The solution will be to use an SVN patch. A patch is a file that is created when you create it. Obviously! SO, a patch, is a file that contains the differential text only and the details about the file where the changes were made. Thus, a patch can be applied to files and can be undone later. So, the code changes are visible only to the person to whom you have given this patch file. The advantage? The other person applying the patch can review the changes that you intend to make, and if some bugs are visible, the patch can be removed from the code base, and you can be informed that you need to do more work to create bug-free code.</p><p>You can view the applying of a patch file as an analogy to tailoring. When you happened to burn your shirt while cooking pizza (a business requirement has changed), you went to the tailor to get your shirt fixed (the business team comes to you to get the new functionality running). The tailor (you) finds a similar piece of cloth and shows you how by stitching it to cover the burnt part of your shirt (the code base). If you don't like the patchwork (the reviewer has found errors in the code), you can ask the tailor to remove the patch and try another color (the reviewer will ask you to make and implement another algorithm). The tailor easily rips off the patch and tries another color (you/reviewer remove/s the patch from the code base). This process goes on until you are satisfied with the patch (until the reviewer finds that your code is working fine). The tailor finally finishes the stitching properly and hands over the shirt to you (you commit the code and hand it over to the release engineer to proceed).</p><p>To sum up, you can create a code patch in PhpStorm.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec192"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>If you want to create a Subversion patch in PhpStorm, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You need to look up (in the top menu), find the menu item, <span class="strong"><strong>VCS</strong></span>, click on it, and find the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Patch</strong></span> option, and PhpStorm will show you a window that you might be familiar with.</li><li class="listitem">Yes, it is a window similar to the <span class="strong"><strong>Commit</strong></span> window, with the difference that the <span class="strong"><strong>Commit</strong></span> button is replaced with a <span class="strong"><strong>Create Patch</strong></span> button.<p>And yes, the functionality is also different. You need to specify a comment that eventually acts as the name of the patch file (spaces replaced with a hyphen), as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_18.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">The default <a id="id436" class="indexterm"/>option is the easiest to understand and execute.

It tends to forget events or things or plans <a id="id441" class="indexterm"/>very easily. It requires continuous effort to make the brain remember things. Since a major part of the brain is dedicated to the visual sense, the most widespread usage to keep the brain on its toes is providing visual hints. Visual hints act in the same way as regular bookmarks would do in a PhpStorm cookbook they let you remember what section you were reading and when.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec194"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>PhpStorm provides you with a feature wherein you can create visually appealing labels, that is, tags.</p><p>Tags are visual labels that let you and your team know which revision was special for you. Thus, you can create visually appealing labels or tags to denote special events, such as <code class="literal">Release Version 2.3</code> or <code class="literal">Bug fixes for V2.2</code>, and so on. So, where is the hint then? The hint is the name. Why visual? Because you can remember names and visuals easily.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec195"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>The labeling process starts from the time that you decide to create a tag.</p><p>It should be a descriptive label because if you are not fully awake at the time of creating the label, you can end up with names such as <code class="literal">Tag 1</code> and <code class="literal">My Tag</code>. It leads to wastage of resources and abuse of technology as well. To create a tag, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Anyway, if you want to create a new tag, you need to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Branch or Tag</strong></span> option available when you select the <span class="strong"><strong>VCS</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>VCS Operations</strong></span> pop up, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_21.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div><p>When you do so, you<a id="id442" class="indexterm"/> see PhpStorm <a id="id443" class="indexterm"/>asking questions in order to make you feel at home, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3878OT_06_22.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">You need to<a id="id444" class="indexterm"/> specify <a id="id445" class="indexterm"/>the source on your development machine you wish to copy the file or folder from to label by enabling the <span class="strong"><strong>Working Copy</strong></span> option and specifying the source file path.</li><li class="listitem">If you need to specify a file or folder to copy from, you need to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Repository Location</strong></span> option and specify the exact location in the current repository and the desired revision number or <span class="strong"><strong>Head</strong></span> (the latest revision).</li><li class="listitem">Then you need to specify the target where you will save the labeled version.</li></ol></div><p>You can specify a location in the repository by specifying the base URL and the label name. This label name will be the visual hint for you.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note30"/>Note</h3><p>You can also specify an arbitrary location such as a repository location or even a location on your development machine.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec196"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you are <a id="id446" class="indexterm"/>convinced<a id="id447" class="indexterm"/> that something works, it will be a great experience to go one step ahead and find out what goes on behind the curtains and what makes that thing work. So, the branch or tag creation process functions in the same way—when you create a tag or a branch in your repository, you just copy files from one location to another. Yes, it is the same copy that most of the engineers are experts at (no pun intended). Thus, there are four combinations available:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You copy from your local working copy to your local working copy</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You copy from your local working copy to another location in the same repository</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You copy from another repository location to a location in your local working copy</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You copy from another repository location to another location in the same repository<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip29"/>Tip</h3><p>It is not mandatory, but it is always recommended that you add comments while doing anything—you can add descriptive comments so that you are able to relate this change to an action in the future.</p></div></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec197"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>Having learned how to label a change in the repository, you can move deeper into the ocean of knowledge by proceeding to create branches. The similarity between a tag and a branch is that both are just folders with certain names. They are different in the purposes they serve. While a tag might be useful for small changes, a branch forms part of a bigger picture.</p><p>A use case will make the scenario clearer to you, and you will be able to differentiate between the two of them. Suppose the technology team has made a release, and they believe this is the last new development done for this version. So, you can make a tag named <code class="literal">Version 2.3 final</code>, add content to it, and leave it forever. Thus, at any time in the future, whenever you need to revisit your project, you will be able to recognize that "Version 2.3 final" meant such and such a release with such and such changes.</p><p>Creating a branch is similar to creating a tag since both are just repository directories. Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">To create a new branch, you need to go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Subversion</strong></span> view, select the appropriate directory from the project view, and access the right-click context menu.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Subversion</strong></span> menu item and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Branch or Tag</strong></span> option. A familiar window will pop-up once you have done that. You need to fill in the basic information for the branch creation to proceed, such as:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The source from where you access the files to be pushed into the Subversion: This source can be somewhere in your local development system (the file/folder you selected by default) or a repository location (you can specify the revision number as well).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The destination where you will put the branch to be: This, again, needs to be a full pathname on your local development machine or a URL pointing to a repository location. It is important to note here that the repository location must be the same repository where your source resides.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The comment you wish to add so you and the team remember the purpose of the branch creation.</li></ul></div></li></ol></div><p>So, you create a<a id="id448" class="indexterm"/> label <a id="id449" class="indexterm"/>to make a revision safe in the repository forever. You create a branch to make a safe and stable version of the code—a branch is created; you work on it, get it tested and approved, and merge it to the trunk.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>It all is a matter of perception</em></span></p></blockquote></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating a task for the team"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec85"/>Creating a task for the team</h1></div></div></div><p>Have you ever imagined how big things are created? How have people successfully managed to build large systems that function so well? What must have been their thinking and mindset when they decided to step out and attempt that extra mile?</p><p>The answer to this is quite simple. A<a id="id450" class="indexterm"/> journey of a thousand miles begins with a single<a id="id451" class="indexterm"/> step. So, when you started thinking about working with your team, you decided to work with version control. You went ahead and learned the tricks of the trade while working with version control. Now, it's the time for you to step out and try out that extra mile. Combine the knowledge you have gained, and get ready to explore one of the ways in which you can create a team task.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec198"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>You want to create a team task so that you can set which section of code needs the attention of which programmer in your team. You can do that by combining the power of TODO (remember creating TODO tasks?) and version control. Thus, any fellow programmer will be able to know quite easily that such and such a task has now been assigned and there needs to be a proper development plan. A great help to the team—you will guide them through the correct way.</p><p>This also has a role to play in the peer code review process in the <span class="strong"><strong>eXtreme Programming</strong></span>
<a id="id452" class="indexterm"/> paradigm of software engineering, wherein you write code and your peer reviews your code. The peer then points out the probably buggy section in your code. Thus, once you push your code to version control with a task for your peer, the <a id="id453" class="indexterm"/>peer can push the changes they have made along with tasks <a id="id454" class="indexterm"/>for you to fix or consider or any changes that might appear as the need of the hour.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec199"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>To create a task is not a difficult task (pun intended). So, if you want to point to another member in your team, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You just need to continue your old style of programming but with a small modification: wherever you feel that more work needs to be done.</li><li class="listitem">You just need to put a TODO followed by the description of the task you wish to bring to the attention of the team. The actual flow to create a general team task while reviewing code is as follows:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Find a piece of code</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Have a thorough read</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Write <code class="literal">// TODO &lt;followed by the task to be done, for example, Add Documentation, team&gt;</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Commit the code to version control</li></ul></div></li></ol></div><p>When you are writing code yourself, you can add a TODO to create a task to set the team thinking in a particular direction. The flow will be as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Write (refined) code—you cannot afford to make mistakes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Find a logic that you think is not completely implemented</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Write <code class="literal">//TODO &lt;followed by the task to be done, e.g. find some fool proof regular expression, team&gt;</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Commit the code to version control</li></ul></div><p>When you want to divide the task among the team, you can use the TODO user followed by the name of the programmer you think would be the most apt choice in getting the work done. The flow becomes as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Read the changed code thoroughly.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Test the code on your development system.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Find possible improvements that can be made, and group them according to the caliber of the team members.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Write TODO and the name of the target programmer, followed by the comment for each of the possible improvements that you found out. Some sample TODOs could be as follows:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">//TODO Alice</code>: This section needs to have the unnecessary variables removed</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">//TODO Bob</code>: The actions inside a for-loop can be done outside the loop for lower execution time</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Commit the code to version control.<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip30"/>Tip</h3><p>This is just one of the ways—you are the person who will find out more and more ways of using version control.</p></div></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec200"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>When you create a <a id="id455" class="indexterm"/>team task, you just create a TODO task and push it to version<a id="id456" class="indexterm"/> control. Thus, in a real sense, you are making use of the PhpStorm TODO feature. So, your TODO is actually passed on to the team members with the help of PhpStorm because it is the parser built with PhpStorm that recognizes the TODO keyword. Thus, when the team takes the update from version control, along with the other revision text, this TODO will also get included in your working copy. So, when a fellow programmer selects the TODO view, the intention is visible.</p><p>The same is the case when you create a TODO task for a particular programmer in your team. So, when everyone in the team takes updates from version control, the same TODO now contains the name of the programmer. This enables team members to focus on their task properly.</p><p>A team task not only helps the team to be more focused on the assigned task and put in more energy thereby, but also attempts to ease some pressure from the cumbersome task of allocating work to the team.</p><p>PhpStorm again to your rescue!</p></div></div></body></html>
