- en: '**PHP** has evolved over several decades from a simple scripting language for
    creating HTML pages to a feature-rich language with an extensive ecosystem. Because
    the vast majority of websites are still powered by PHP, it is one of the cornerstones
    of the internet.'

- en: While still beginner-friendly, it can be used to implement everything from small
    websites to enterprise applications used worldwide. However, the low entry barriers
    of PHP sometimes lead to code that is difficult to understand and impossible to
    maintain.

- en: With this book, we want to introduce you to the world of **Clean Code**. You
    will learn a lot about the theory and also, how to apply the knowledge you learned
    in the real world. You will learn which tools will support you on this journey
    and which best practices you should use to be able to implement Clean Code successfully
    in your team.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of this first part is to introduce the concepts of clean code and
    the theory behind it. This part is intended to be quite theoretical, although
    concrete examples will be discussed as the chapters progress. The first approach
    of clean code is proposed in order to explain its usefulness and why it is necessary
    in the life of a developer.
