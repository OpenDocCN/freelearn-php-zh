The majority of that time, I lived in Palo Alto, which is the center of Silicon Valley, the home of Stanford University, and the birthplace of many companies, big and small, such as Sun Microsystems, where I worked. I sat on the front row to see how the World Wide Web developed, as well as being present for the advent of social media. Facebook started on the other side of the wall of my favorite restaurant. Now, some Facebook guy or girl is sitting in what used to be my office at the bottom of the Dumbarton Bridge. As a product manager for Solaris, one of my tasks was to make sure that Netscape Navigator was included with our operating system. So, I was right at the source in which the development of the Web began. I even went to the Web 2.0 conference and bought the book of the same name.</p><p>Then, I felt the need to have my own website to display my photographs and inform people about the beauty and interesting places of the parts of California that I had discovered during my many journeys travelling around the state. So, I created one. One day, I was telling a friend about it and he tried to look at it on his mobile phone. It looked terrible. So, I bought a Nokia phone (a brick compared to what we have today) so that I could test my own site to make sure that it looked good on a phone as well. This is how I caught the bug of responsive design, years before someone started calling it this.</p><p>Upon my return to Belgium, I decided that it was time to learn as much as possible (I love to learn new things) about what is out there beyond creating websites and took a 6-month course on PHP web development. A lot of it looked familiar as I was previously a UNIX and C developer. There were only 12 people in the class, who were all bright minds, and I quickly discovered that there was more to learn.</p><p>As the classes took place in Leuven, a major university town in Belgium, I went to the local university bookstore and bought book after book on all kinds of related topics and quickly became a jQuery fan. jQuery, by the way, was not even included in the course. I started wondering why someone needed to have 35 different books to learn about web development and that writing a single book that gave a comprehensive overview of what you need to know to engage in web development would not be a bad idea.</p><p>Since then, web development has changed a lot; more books were needed, eBooks this time, but the concept remained the same. So, now you know why I wrote the book.</p><p>This book gives you an overview of all the general aspects of web development, in a traditional way, using plain HTML to do static websites, as well as the current way, to enable you to create your web pages dynamically and make sure that they look great on mobile devices as well, by using responsive design. We conclude by giving you a hint of what is yet to come if you replace the traditional web server by writing your own using node.js.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The World Wide Web">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The World Wide Web</em></span>, gives you an overview of the history of what we know today as the World Wide Web.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. HTML">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>HTML</em></span>, introduces HTML and gives you an overview of the most commonly used HTML tags to do web development. You will be able to create a basic website after reading this chapter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. CSS">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>CSS</em></span>, explains how to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This is used for the presentation part or layout of your website, from color to dimensions to typefaces. The most commonly used CSS properties are explained here. Once you are done with this chapter, you will be able to make your basic website look good.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. JavaScript">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript</em></span>, first gives you an introduction to the world of programming and programming languages. Next, the overall syntax of JavaScript and how to use it for client-side programming is introduced.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. PHP">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>PHP</em></span>, explains PHP, which is another programming language. This one is used to do server-side programming. It requires a web server to do the development of your website and deploy it. You will learn how to dynamically create your web pages, rather than having to write a bunch of HTML files.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. PHP and MySQL">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>PHP and MySQL</em></span>, introduces MySQL, an open source database. You will learn how to create a database, manage it using the phpMyAdmin tool, and perform basic CRUD (create, replace, update, delete) operations from within a PHP program.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. jQuery">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>jQuery</em></span>, covers a popular JavaScript library. It allows you to write more compact and clean code and handles browser incompatibilities for you. With this, it is going to be a lot easier and faster for you to write JavaScript code that traverses and manipulates the  web page. It does so by using selectors, which you learned to use with CSS. So, with jQuery, you can write JavaScript code without having to learn a lot of JavaScript.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Ajax">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Ajax</em></span>, introduces Ajax. It represents a collection of techniques to make it easy to dynamically change only portions of a website. With this chapter, we have entered the world of what I call "modern web development". The interface that we use for our Ajax calls is jQuery.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. The History API – Not Forgetting Where We Are">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The History API—Not Forgetting Where We Are</em></span>, explains a very important piece of the web development puzzle. Once we are changing pages on the fly so they look different but actually remain the same page (URL), strange things can happen when visitors want to go back to what they think is the previous page. A solution for this is described here that will not only work for HTML5 but for HTML4 as well.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. XML and JSON">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>XML and JSON</em></span>, describes XML and JSON. They are two popular formats to exchange data, for example the server and the client. Although XML is used in a variety of environments, JSON is closer to the web development community. </p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. MongoDB">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>MongoDB</em></span>, describes an alternative to MySQL as a database. This is a so-called NoSQL database and a document database. Documents are conveniently in the JSON format. Here, how to access a MongoDB database from within a PHP program is described.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Mobile First, Responsive Design with Progressive Enhancement">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mobile First, Responsive Design with Progressive Enhancement</em></span>, has the longest chapter title of the book. It explains how modern web development has to be done now that more people are using mobile devices instead of traditional computer screens to go to websites.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Foundation – A Responsive CSS/JavaScript Framework">Chapter 13</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Foundation – A Responsive CSS/JavaScript Framework</em></span>, describes most of the features of the Foundation framework, which helps you with your responsive design. It contains everything that I have always wanted to write myself but never had the time to do. This concludes the part of the book that covers what I call modern web development.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Node.js">Chapter 14</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Node.js</em></span>, gives an overview of what I call the avant-garde of web development. It introduces node.js, which allows you to write your server-side code in JavaScript, including your own web server, which is facilitated by using the Express framework.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Bootstrap – An Alternative to Foundation">Appendix</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bootstrap – An Alternative to Foundation</em></span>, describes the popular CSS/JavaScript framework, which is an alternative to Foundation to help you with responsive design. The main reason to include this is to point out key differences and similarities.</p><p>The online chapter, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Mono County Site</em></span>, provides a full example of a website or application where we apply most, if not all, the things we learned. It is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/B03816_Appendix.pdf">https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/B03816_Appendix.pdf</a>.</p></div></div>
